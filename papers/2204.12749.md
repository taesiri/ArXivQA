# [Control Globally, Understand Locally: A Global-to-Local Hierarchical   Graph Network for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12749)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively model the hierarchical relationships between the global cause, local psychological intentions and dialog history in emotional support conversation, in order to generate more supportive responses. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel model called Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) to capture the global cause and local intentions and model their hierarchical relationships. The key ideas and components are:

- Capturing global cause and local intentions: Use a multi-source encoder with COMET to extract the global cause describing the emotional problem and local psychological intentions of the help-seeker.

- Modeling hierarchical relationships: Design a hierarchical graph reasoner to model the relationships between global cause (dialog-level), local intentions (sentence-level) and dialog history. 

- Training with global supervision: Propose a novel training objective to monitor the semantic information of global cause using the conversation's problem type, so that global cause will not be biased by local intentions.

The central hypothesis is that by effectively modeling the hierarchical relationships between multi-source information (global, local and history), the model can gain better global-to-local understanding of the conversation and generate more supportive responses. Experiments on the ESConv dataset confirm the state-of-the-art performance of GLHG.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) for emotional support conversation. The key ideas are:

1. Capturing global cause and local psychological intentions using a multi-source encoder. The global cause describes the overall problem of the help-seeker, while the local intention reflects the implicit mental state in each utterance. 

2. Modeling hierarchical relationships between global cause, local intentions and dialog history using a hierarchical graph reasoner. This allows propagating relevant information at different levels for better understanding.

3. A novel training objective to monitor the semantic information of global cause using an auxiliary loss, so that the global cause will not be biased by local intentions.

4. Experiments on the emotional support conversation dataset ESConv demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations show the benefit of modeling global cause, local intentions, and their relationships using the proposed approach.

In summary, the key novelty is exploiting global-to-local information and relationships for emotional support conversation via hierarchical graph modeling and an auxiliary training objective. This leads to improved performance over prior methods that lack such hierarchical modeling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) model for emotional support conversation that captures global cause information, local psychological intentions, and dialog history using a multi-source encoder, models their hierarchical relationships using a graph reasoner, and generates supportive responses while monitoring semantic information of the global cause with a novel training objective.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of emotional support conversation:

- This paper focuses on incorporating global context and local intention understanding into an emotional support conversation system. Most prior work has focused more narrowly on generating empathetic or emotionally appropriate responses based on the immediate context, without considering the broader situation or intention behind the conversation.  

- A key contribution is the proposed Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) model architecture. This allows the integration of global cause, local intention, and dialog history into a structured graph representation. Other recent work has started exploring graph-based neural models for dialog, but not for this specific purpose of modeling a hierarchy from global situation to local intention.

- The paper introduces a new training technique of using an auxiliary loss to monitor the global semantic information, helping ensure the global cause representation isn't biased by local details. Monitoring and controlling high-level semantic content is an interesting idea that doesn't seem to be explored much in other dialog research.

- The GLHG model outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the ESConv emotional support dialog dataset, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluations. This suggests their approach is advancing the state of the art on this specific task.

- The focus is on a single dataset in a relatively new domain of emotional support conversation. Many recent dialog papers have focused on chit-chat style dialog. This contributes a useful model tailored for an underexplored application area.

In summary, the hierarchical modeling of global and local information seems novel in dialog research, and the paper provides solid quantitative and human evaluation results on a domain of high social relevance. The proposed techniques could potentially transfer to broader conversational AI applications as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other mental states beyond just intention (xIntent) from ATOMIC for capturing psychological states of speakers in dialog. The paper currently focuses only on using xIntent, but the authors suggest expanding to also incorporate things like the speaker's reactions (xReact) could be beneficial.

- Adopting the proposed Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) model for other dialog tasks beyond just emotional support conversation, such as empathetic dialog, negotiation, persuasion, etc. The hierarchical modeling and graph reasoning approach could be applicable in other dialog domains.

- Incorporating additional commonsense knowledge beyond just from ATOMIC/COMET. The authors suggest exploring integrating other commonsense knowledge graphs and sources could help further improve performance.

- Evaluating the approach on other datasets beyond just the ESConv emotional support dialog dataset used in this paper. Testing the generalizability and broader applicability of GLHG on other dialog tasks/datasets is noted as an area for future work.

- Further analysis into what patterns emerge in the dialog responses generated by GLHG, to better understand what strategies it learns for providing emotional support. The authors suggest further exploration of this could provide additional insights.

- Continued work on generating more human-like and natural dialog responses. While GLHG improves over prior baselines, the authors note there is still room for improvement in terms of response quality and human-likeness.

So in summary, the main future directions pointed out are expanding the types of mental states modeled, applying the approach to other dialog tasks, incorporating additional knowledge sources, testing on more datasets, analyzing emergent response patterns, and improving response naturalness. The hierarchical graph modeling approach shows promise but there are many opportunities highlighted for building on this further.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) for emotional support conversation. The goal is to generate supportive responses to a help-seeker by exploring the cause of their emotional distress and understanding their psychological intentions. The model consists of three components: 1) A multi-source encoder that captures the global cause, local psychological intentions, and dialog history; 2) A hierarchical graph reasoner that models the relationships between the global cause, local intentions, and dialog for reasoning; 3) A global-guide decoder that generates responses and uses a novel loss to monitor the semantic information of the global cause. Experiments on the ESConv dataset show GLHG achieves state-of-the-art performance on automatic metrics and human evaluations. The results demonstrate the benefits of modeling both global and local factors hierarchically for providing emotional support in conversations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) for emotional support conversation. The goal is to help reduce the emotional distress of the help-seeker by exploring the cause of their problem and understanding their psychological intentions. 

The GLHG model has three main components. First, a multi-source encoder captures the global cause of the problem, local psychological intentions, and dialog history. It uses a commonsense reasoning model called COMET to help identify intentions. Second, a hierarchical graph reasoner models relationships between the global cause, local intentions, and dialog history. This enables situational understanding. Third, a global-guide decoder generates supportive responses while monitoring semantic information about the global cause. This prevents the global understanding from becoming biased by local details. Experiments on the ESConv dataset show GLHG improves both automatic metrics and human evaluations compared to prior methods. It better identifies problems, provides comfort, and makes helpful suggestions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) for emotional support conversation modeling. The model consists of three main components: 1) A multi-source encoder that captures the global cause of the conversation using the situation text, and the local psychological intentions using a commonsense reasoning model. 2) A hierarchical graph reasoner that models the relationships between the global cause, local intentions, and dialog history by connecting them as nodes in a graph and performing graph attention to propagate information between them. 3) A global-guide decoder that generates supportive responses conditioned on the graph representations, and has an additional loss to ensure the global cause information is maintained. The key ideas are to model both global and local factors that are not explicitly given, and use graph modeling and attention to integrate them with the dialog history in a hierarchical manner. This allows the model to build better situational understanding and generate more appropriate supportive responses.
