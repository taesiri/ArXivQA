# Control Globally, Understand Locally: A Global-to-Local Hierarchical   Graph Network for Emotional Support Conversation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively model the hierarchical relationships between the global cause, local psychological intentions and dialog history in emotional support conversation, in order to generate more supportive responses. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel model called Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) to capture the global cause and local intentions and model their hierarchical relationships. The key ideas and components are:- Capturing global cause and local intentions: Use a multi-source encoder with COMET to extract the global cause describing the emotional problem and local psychological intentions of the help-seeker.- Modeling hierarchical relationships: Design a hierarchical graph reasoner to model the relationships between global cause (dialog-level), local intentions (sentence-level) and dialog history. - Training with global supervision: Propose a novel training objective to monitor the semantic information of global cause using the conversation's problem type, so that global cause will not be biased by local intentions.The central hypothesis is that by effectively modeling the hierarchical relationships between multi-source information (global, local and history), the model can gain better global-to-local understanding of the conversation and generate more supportive responses. Experiments on the ESConv dataset confirm the state-of-the-art performance of GLHG.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network (GLHG) for emotional support conversation. The key ideas are:1. Capturing global cause and local psychological intentions using a multi-source encoder. The global cause describes the overall problem of the help-seeker, while the local intention reflects the implicit mental state in each utterance. 2. Modeling hierarchical relationships between global cause, local intentions and dialog history using a hierarchical graph reasoner. This allows propagating relevant information at different levels for better understanding.3. A novel training objective to monitor the semantic information of global cause using an auxiliary loss, so that the global cause will not be biased by local intentions.4. Experiments on the emotional support conversation dataset ESConv demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations show the benefit of modeling global cause, local intentions, and their relationships using the proposed approach.In summary, the key novelty is exploiting global-to-local information and relationships for emotional support conversation via hierarchical graph modeling and an auxiliary training objective. This leads to improved performance over prior methods that lack such hierarchical modeling.
