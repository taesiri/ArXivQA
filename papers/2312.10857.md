# [Minimal Macro-Based Rewritings of Formal Languages: Theory and   Applications in Ontology Engineering (and beyond)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10857)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the lack of universal mechanisms for simplifying and reducing repetition in formal languages like knowledge bases, specifications, and theories. While principles like "keep it simple" and "don't repeat yourself" are valuable, putting them into practice is challenging due to the need to preserve application-specific properties and the difficulty of specifying what constitutes good refactoring. There is a delicate balance between simplicity and obscurity.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a formal framework for refactoring formal languages by automatically converting them into smaller rewritings. The focus is on a rewriting mechanism based on syntactic macros that can capture recurring structures. For example, in a logical formula the subformula "(a AND b)" could be replaced everywhere with a macro "m" and defined as "m = (a AND b)". 

The paper defines macro systems formally, including acyclicity constraints and fixed-point semantics. It then analyzes the problem of finding size-minimal rewritings, i.e. encodings of the original language into a macrofied version that is as small as possible. The complexity of three variants of the minimal rewriting problem are studied. Polynomial-time algorithms are presented for restricted cases.

Contributions:
- Formal framework for refactoring formal languages with syntactic macros
- Complexity analysis of problems related to minimal rewriting 
- Polynomial-time algorithms for finding minimal rewritings under certain conditions
- Demonstration of the feasibility & effectiveness of the approach by significantly reducing the size of large biomedical ontologies 

The key insight is to use the complexity of computing minimal rewritings for a macro system as a way to evaluate the impact of particular features like nesting of macros. This allows informed decisions about which features to include. The work introduces a general methodology for analyzing refactoring mechanisms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework for refactoring formal languages by computing size-minimal rewritings based on syntactic macros, presents polynomial-time algorithms for finding such rewritings under different settings, proves their correctness, and demonstrates their practical feasibility and effectiveness by significantly reducing the size of real-world biomedical ontologies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the problem of rewriting finite formal languages using syntactic macros to minimize the size of the rewritten language. Specifically, it formulates and analyzes three variants of this problem: rewriting with respect to given macro definitions (Problem 1), equivalent macro definitions (Problem 2), and any macro definitions (Problem 3).

2. It presents polynomial-time algorithms to solve these problem variants and proves their correctness. 

3. It demonstrates the practical relevance and effectiveness of the proposed problems and algorithms by applying them to minimize the size of real-world biomedical ontologies authored in OWL. The size reductions achieved are comparable or better than those of existing approaches, while also showing superior performance in terms of processing time.

4. More broadly, it introduces a general framework and methodology for systematically analyzing and evaluating features of rewriting systems (like syntactic macros) by formulating problems related to those features and analyzing the computational complexity of solving them.

In summary, the main contributions are: (i) formulating new size minimization problems for languages using macros, (ii) providing polynomial-time algorithms, (iii) demonstrating practical applicability to ontologies, and (iv) a general methodology for evaluating rewriting system features.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Syntactic macros - The paper introduces the concept of syntactic macros, which are rules that map input sets of terms to output terms. These act as rewriting rules to compress expressions.

- Macro instantiation - The inverse process of macro expansion, where a term is replaced by a macro symbol that can expand to that term.

- Minimal encodings - Finding macro systems that encode a formal language in a size-minimal way. This includes variants like finding minimal encodings for fixed macro definitions or minimal encodings over any possible macro definitions.

- Macro dependence - Whether the instantiation of one macro can affect the instantiation of another macro. This is related to macro containment relationships.

- Ontology engineering - A key application area explored is using syntactic macros to minimize the size of ontologies in OWL.

- Algorithm analysis - The paper analyzes the algorithmic complexity of problems related to finding minimal macro encodings, showing some variants are solvable in polynomial time.

In summary, the key focus is on syntactic macro systems, their use for minimizing representations of formal languages, analysis of computational problems related to this, and applications in ontology engineering.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the problem of finding minimal macro-based rewritings of formal languages. What are the key elements of this problem formulation, i.e. what constitutes a "rewriting", what does "minimal" refer to, etc.?

2. Explain the difference between the three variants of the minimal rewriting problem that are introduced in the paper (Problems 1-3). What are the inputs and constraints for each problem? 

3. The notion of macro dependency plays an important role in the paper. Define what macro dependency means and explain why it is relevant for finding minimal rewritings.

4. One of the key results is an algorithm that can find minimal rewritings in polynomial time for Problem 1. Walk through the main steps of this algorithm and explain why it yields minimal rewritings.  

5. The algorithm for Problem 1 is extended to handle Problem 2, which considers macro definition equivalences. What does equivalence of macro definitions mean in this context? How is the algorithm adapted to account for this?

6. For Problem 3, the paper gives a characterization of which macro definitions should be included for a minimal rewriting. Explain this characterization and why macro definitions meeting this characterization guarantee minimality. 

7. The empirical evaluation focuses on applying the algorithms to real-world biomedical ontologies. Discuss the specifics of how the algorithms are adapted to work for OWL ontologies and what practical limitations needed to be addressed.

8. The size reductions obtained by the algorithms are comparable to previous approaches, but the processing times are significantly faster. What aspects of the algorithms contribute to their efficiency? 

9. Could the proposed rewriting approach be applied to contexts other than ontologies? If so, what other potential use cases seem promising and what adaptations would need to be made?

10. The paper leaves open some questions about restrictions on macro systems, such as disallowing nesting or macro cycles. How could an analysis of how such restrictions affect the complexity of finding minimal rewritings help guide choices about macro system design?
