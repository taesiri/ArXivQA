# [Human Body Model based ID using Shape and Pose Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03227)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a Human Body Model based biometric IDentification (HMID) system for person recognition using 3D body shape and pose estimated from image sequences. HMID builds on the Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) network by adding losses during training to improve shape estimation and biometric feature extraction. Additional silhouette and pose losses are used to refine the shape parameters while constraining pose estimates. Biometric features are extracted from the raw feature layer of HMR instead of just the shape parameters. Experiments show HMID significantly outperforms HMR on biometric accuracy when trained with these extra losses. Evaluations are conducted on the BRIAR and USF datasets which have challenges like clothing variation, low resolution, and viewpoint changes. HMID aggregates features across multiple frames using estimated pose, and matches feature sets to handle these complications. Results demonstrate higher biometric performance than previous silhouette-based or model-based approaches on BRIAR and cross-collection on USF. The method is promising for surveillance applications needing robustness to factors like range, resolution, and view angle.
