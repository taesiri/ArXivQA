# [Steerable 3D Spherical Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13863v7)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- It proposes a method to make spherical neuron models steerable and rotation-invariant for 3D point cloud classification. Spherical neurons have spherical decision boundaries and can be obtained via conformal embedding. - It proves that the activation of a spherical neuron on a rotated input only varies by up to first degree spherical harmonics. This allows deriving a 3D steerability constraint for spherical neurons.- It shows how to construct a rotation-equivariant spherical filter bank using 4 rotated copies of a spherical neuron. Together with derived interpolation coefficients, this allows fulfilling the 3D steerability constraint.- It verifies the theoretical steerability results on synthetic 3D Tetris shapes and real 3D skeleton datasets. With known rotation, the steerable model gives identical results to the base model on canonical inputs.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that spherical neuron models can be made steerable for 3D point clouds to achieve rotation-invariance. The paper provides theoretical analysis and experiments to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a steerable feed-forward learning-based approach using spherical neurons to classify 3D point clouds in a rotation-equivariant and invariant manner. Specifically:- They prove that the activation of spherical neurons on rotated input only varies by up to first-degree spherical harmonics. This allows deriving a 3D steerability constraint.- They construct rotation-equivariant spherical filter banks from spherical neurons trained on data in a canonical orientation, by rotating them to the vertices of a tetrahedron. - They derive a novel 3D steerability constraint to compute interpolation coefficients to make the filter bank outputs rotation-invariant.- They empirically validate the theoretical steerability constraint on synthetic 3D shapes and real 3D skeleton data, showing the model produces equally accurate classifications for rotated inputs as the original model on canonical inputs.In summary, the key contribution is using the geometry of spherical neurons to develop a principled and interpretable method for making classifiers on 3D point clouds steerable and rotation-invariant. The theoretical steerability constraint is the main novel result.
