# [MT-Bench-101: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language   Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn conversations remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained assessments for multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and nuances of real-life conversations. There is a need for a comprehensive benchmark to effectively evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn dialogues.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces MT-Bench-101, a new benchmark designed specifically to assess LLMs' fine-grained abilities in multi-turn dialogues. The key aspects include:

- A 3-tier hierarchical taxonomy of abilities for multi-turn dialogues, encompassing 4208 turns across 1388 dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. Abilities range from basic perceptivity to advanced interactivity.

- Careful prompts and methodology for using GPT-4 to generate high-quality multi-turn dialogues reflecting real-world conversations. Data covers 30 diverse topics.

- Customized evaluation prompts and scoring guidelines for each task. GPT-4 is utilized to automatically score model performance on a scale of 1-10. 

- Analysis of 21 popular LLMs based on the benchmark, assessing overall trends and per-turn performance.

Main Contributions:

- First fine-grained benchmark focused specifically on assessing multi-turn dialogue abilities of LLMs, with a large taxonomy of abilities.

- Rigorous data generation and tailored evaluation methodology enabling granular analysis of model strengths/weaknesses.

- Extensive experiments on 21 LLMs revealing trends and deficiencies in multi-turn skills, especially in adaptability and interactivity. 

- Framework and analysis providing direction for improving multi-turn dialogue abilities of existing and future LLMs.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through the introduction of MT-Bench-101 benchmark and an in-depth evaluation of LLMs, highlighting areas for advancing multi-turn conversational intelligence.
