# [PATS: Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision for Local Feature   Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07700)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to enable accurate and dense local feature matching between image pairs with large scale differences. The key ideas proposed to address this question are:

1) Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision (PATS): This involves splitting images into patches, estimating scale differences between patches, aligning patch contents based on estimated scales, and hierarchically subdividing and refining matches from coarse to fine.

2) Patch area transportation: Formulating patch matching as an optimal transport problem to find many-to-many patch correspondences and scale differences in a self-supervised manner. 

3) Scale-adaptive patch subdivision: Iteratively cropping corresponding patch pairs, resizing to align scales, and subdividing into smaller patches to refine matches across scales.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that explicitly estimating and aligning for scale differences between image patches in a hierarchical framework will enable more accurate and dense correspondences between image pairs with large variations in scale. The Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision method is proposed to test this hypothesis.
