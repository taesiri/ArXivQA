# [SkipPredict: When to Invest in Predictions for Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prior work on prediction-based scheduling algorithms for queueing systems assumes that predictions are provided "for free", without accounting for the resources and costs required to generate them. However, in practice predictions consume resources, so it's important to consider their costs when evaluating if and when predictions provide enough benefit to justify using them. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new prediction-based scheduling algorithm called "SkipPredict" that is designed to address the cost of predictions. The key ideas are:

1) Use a two-stage prediction process: First generate "cheap predictions" to classify jobs as short or long. Only do more expensive and detailed predictions for jobs classified as long. This reduces overall prediction costs. 

2) Prioritize predicted short jobs over long jobs to minimize their response time. Use detailed predictions on long jobs to schedule them based on shortest predicted remaining processing time.

3) Analyze SkipPredict under two cost models: An "external cost" model where predictions are done externally but incur a fixed cost, and a "server time cost" model where generating predictions consumes server processing time.

4) Derive equations for mean response time under both cost models using the SOAP framework, and compare to prior algorithms like SPRPT and 1-bit prediction schemes.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the idea of accounting for prediction costs when analyzing/designing prediction-based scheduling algorithms

- Proposes SkipPredict as an efficient algorithm that reduces costs by only doing detailed predictions on a subset of "long" jobs

- Provides a detailed analysis and comparison to other algorithms under two distinct cost models 

- Demonstrates when and why investing in predictions can be cost-effective depending on system load, arrival rate, and cost structure

- Discusses variants like DelayPredict and outlines directions for future work in this emerging area


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces and analyzes SkipPredict, a novel scheduling algorithm for incorporating predictions into queueing systems in a cost-effective manner by categorizing jobs based on cheap predictions and only doing more expensive predictions for a subset of jobs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces and analyzes a new scheduling algorithm called SkipPredict for queueing systems that uses two stages of predictions - "cheap" predictions to categorize jobs as short or long, and more expensive predictions of job sizes for the jobs categorized as long. The main contributions are:

1) Proposing the SkipPredict algorithm that prioritizes predicted short jobs over long jobs, and only does the more expensive predictions for the long jobs in order to reduce prediction costs.

2) Analyzing SkipPredict under two models - an external cost model where predictions are done externally, and a server time cost model where predictions take up server time. Equations are derived for the mean response times under both models.  

3) Comparing SkipPredict to other algorithms like FCFS, 1bit, and SPRPT in terms of total cost, which includes both prediction costs and mean response time. The analysis shows SkipPredict can outperform these baselines when there is a significant gap between cheap and expensive prediction costs.

4) Introducing an alternative algorithm called DelayPredict and comparing it to SkipPredict.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel prediction-based scheduling approach tailored to the inherent cost of predictions, and analyzing its performance in comparison to other algorithms.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Prediction-based scheduling - Using predictions from machine learning models to optimize scheduling algorithms.

- Learning-augmented algorithms - Classical algorithms that are optimized by incorporating predictions.

- Queueing systems - Systems with jobs waiting to be processed, like the M/G/1 queue modeled in the paper.  

- Two stages of prediction - The paper considers "cheap" one-bit predictions to classify jobs, and more expensive predictions to estimate job sizes.

- External cost model - Predictions are generated externally and incur a fixed cost, but don't impact job processing times.  

- Server time cost model - Predictions require server time and are scheduled alongside jobs.

- Mean response time - A key performance metric that includes waiting time and residence time.

- SOAP framework - Method for analyzing mean response time of scheduling policies, used to analyze the algorithms.

- SkipPredict algorithm - The novel scheduling policy proposed in the paper that uses two stages of prediction.

Some other notable terms are the DelayPredict policy, SPRPT, recycled/original jobs, prediction models like uniform and exponential, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel "cheap prediction, expensive prediction" framework for scheduling jobs. What are some other prediction frameworks that could be explored for scheduling, and what potential benefits or drawbacks might they have compared to the proposed approach?

2. How might the performance of the SkipPredict algorithm change if there were more than two levels of prediction available (e.g. cheap, moderate, expensive)? What are some ways the algorithm could be adapted to leverage additional prediction tiers? 

3. The paper analyzes SkipPredict under two distinct cost models - external cost and server time cost. Are there other sensible cost models for predictions that could impact the performance of SkipPredict? How might the algorithm perform under alternative cost models?

4. SkipPredict relies on having a single threshold T to categorize jobs as short or long based on the cheap predictions. What techniques could be used to set an optimal value for T under different system conditions? 

5. How robust is SkipPredict to errors or noise in the cheap and/or expensive predictions? What level of prediction accuracy is needed to maintain good performance?

6. Could machine learning techniques be used to generate better quality tailored predictions for SkipPredict? If so, what training approaches and architectures might be well-suited?

7. SkipPredict is analyzed for an M/G/1 queue. How might its performance change for other queueing systems (e.g. parallel servers, priority queues, etc)?

8. The DelayPredict algorithm is proposed as an alternative that avoids cheap predictions. In what scenarios might DelayPredict outperform SkipPredict? When would the opposite be true? 

9. What other scheduling algorithms with predictions could be viable alternatives to compare against SkipPredict? What are the key strengths and weaknesses they might have?

10. The paper suggests several variants of SkipPredict as future work. Which of those variants seems most promising to explore further and what open questions remain about its potential?
