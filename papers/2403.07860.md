# [Bridging Different Language Models and Generative Vision Models for   Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07860)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-to-image diffusion models typically consist of a language model and a generative vision model. As these two types of models continue to advance rapidly in their respective fields, there is a gap between the language/vision modules used in existing text-to-image models and state-of-the-art models in language understanding and image generation. Replacing components in text-to-image models with more advanced counterparts is non-trivial due to the tight coupling between language and vision models after joint training. Therefore, it is important to explore ways to bridge different language and generative vision models for enhancing text-to-image generation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LaVi-Bridge, a flexible framework that enables integrating diverse pre-trained language models and generative vision models for text-to-image generation. LaVi-Bridge injects LoRA into language and vision models separately and utilizes an adapter to bridge them. It keeps the original model weights fixed and only trains the lightweight LoRA and adapter parameters. This makes it compatible with various model structures without modifications to original weights.

Main Contributions:
- LaVi-Bridge serves as a bridge capable of connecting different pre-trained language and generative vision models, accommodating encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only language models as well as U-Net and ViT based vision models.
- It achieves integration without changing original model weights, only training LoRA and adapter. This is more flexible and cheaper.
- Experiments show superior language or vision models lead to improved performance in the corresponding modality. Also, Llama-2 demonstrates exceptional semantic understanding while transformer in PixArt yields higher image quality aesthetics.
- Extensive quantitative evaluation on text alignment and image quality using metrics like FID, aesthetics, and CLIP score. Detailed qualitative analysis also provided.

In summary, LaVi-Bridge offers a plug-and-play approach to incorporate advanced language and vision models into text-to-image generation while being compatible with diverse model structures and maintaining weight efficiency. Both quantitative results and visualization showcase the effectiveness of the framework.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LaVi-Bridge, a flexible framework that enables integrating diverse pre-trained language models and generative vision models for text-to-image generation. Specifically:

- LaVi-Bridge serves as a bridge to connect various language models and vision models using LoRA and adapters, without needing to modify the original weights of the models. 

- It accommodates different model structures including encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only language models, as well as U-Net-based and Transformer-based vision models.

- Experiments show that incorporating superior language or vision models into the framework leads to improved performance in the corresponding modality, e.g. better text comprehension with advanced language models or enhanced image quality with more powerful vision models.

- LaVi-Bridge allows leveraging the latest advancements in NLP and CV to enhance text-to-image generation with a relatively small dataset and computing resources compared to training the entire diffusion model.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a flexible and effective pipeline to integrate diverse language and vision models for the text-to-image generation task.
