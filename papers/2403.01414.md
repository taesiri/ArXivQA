## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unsigned Orthogonal Distance Fields: An Accurate Neural Implicit Representation for Diverse 3D Shapes":

Problem:
- Existing neural implicit representations like signed distance fields (SDF) and unsigned distance fields (UDF) suffer from degradation in reconstruction accuracy when converting to explicit surface points and meshes. 
- SDF can only represent watertight shapes. UDF can represent arbitrary shapes but has issues with accuracy.
- The common marching cubes algorithm for reconstruction from SDF/UDF leads to interpolation errors between predicted values at grid corners.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new representation called unsigned orthogonal distance fields (UODFs) where the distance to the surface is defined along three orthogonal directions. 
- Each point in UODFs can directly access closest surface points along the three directions.
- Use separate MLP networks to regress each UODF and a mask indicating shape silhouette.
- Surface points are estimated directly from UODF samples along each ray without interpolation.
- Points from different rays are fused to reconstruct final surface.

Main Contributions:
- UODFs allow unified and accurate reconstruction of diverse shapes including watertight, non-watertight, multi-layer, assembling models.
- Direct estimation of surface points from UODFs eliminates interpolation errors during reconstruction.
- Experiments on over 50 shapes show UODFs significantly outperform SDF/UDF in terms of reconstruction accuracy, especially for non-watertight shapes and small point clouds.
- UODFs achieve comparable or better accuracy than SDF/UDF methods using ground truth data, demonstrating robustness.

In summary, the paper introduces UODFs as a new neural representation for shapes that enables highly accurate and unified reconstruction of complex geometries. The direct mapping from UODF samples to surface points is a key benefit over traditional SDF/UDF approaches.
