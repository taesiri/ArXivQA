## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method called CMG-Net for robustly estimating normals from noisy point clouds. The key innovation is the introduction of a new metric called Chamfer Normal Distance (CND) to address inconsistency between annotated normals and underlying geometry of noisy points. This helps significantly enhance network training and performance. The method also proposes a multi-scale architecture that aggregates local features across scales and hierarchically fuses global geometry information. This captures intricate shape details effectively while alleviating issues in optimal scale selection. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, with particular improvements in noisy cases and preservation of geometric details. Downstream tasks like surface reconstruction and denoising also showcase superior quality leveraging the robust normal estimates from CMG-Net. The method does have limitations in terms of real-time capability and dependence on supervised learning. But overall it substantially pushes the boundaries for learning-based robust normal estimation on complex point cloud data.
