# [DynaMask: Dynamic Mask Selection for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07868)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to achieve high-quality instance segmentation while maintaining high efficiency. 

Specifically, the authors propose a method to dynamically select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance in an image, rather than using a uniform mask resolution for all instances. The key ideas are:

1) Develop a dual-level FPN to gradually increase the mask resolution, so that "hard" instances can be segmented with high-resolution masks to capture fine details. 

2) Introduce a lightweight Mask Switch Module to predict the optimal mask resolution for each instance based on its difficulty, so that "easy" instances can be segmented efficiently with low-resolution masks.

The main hypothesis is that by adaptively assigning masks of different resolutions, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency compared to using a uniform mask size. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic mask selection approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called DynaMask for dynamic mask selection in instance segmentation. The key ideas are:

- A dual-level Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is developed to gradually increase the mask resolution, allowing high-quality segmentation especially for objects with irregular shapes and complex boundaries. It contains an image-level FPN (i-FPN) and a region-level FPN (r-FPN). The r-FPN incrementally incorporates contextual and detailed information from i-FPN for coarse-to-fine mask prediction.

- A Mask Switch Module (MSM) is proposed to dynamically select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance. It predicts a mask resolution from a set of candidates to balance accuracy and efficiency. Larger masks are assigned to "hard" instances while smaller masks are assigned to "easy" ones. 

- Extensive experiments show DynaMask brings significant and consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-arts with a moderate computation overhead. It outperforms Mask R-CNN by 2.9% AP on COCO with ResNet-50 backbone.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a flexible mask selection framework DynaMask to achieve high-quality instance segmentation with adaptive computation cost. The dual-level FPN explores multi-scale features for mask refinement while MSM dynamically adjusts the mask resolution based on instance properties.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dynamic mask selection method for instance segmentation called DynaMask, which assigns high-resolution masks to "hard" instances and low-resolution masks to "easy" instances to balance accuracy and efficiency.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in instance segmentation:

- The main contribution of this paper is the idea of dynamically selecting mask resolutions for each instance rather than using a fixed resolution for all instances. This is a novel idea that helps improve efficiency and accuracy.

- Most prior work in instance segmentation uses a fixed mask resolution, such as 28x28 in Mask R-CNN. A few papers have looked at using higher resolution masks, but did not adapt the resolution per instance like this paper does.

- Other related work includes PointRend and RefineMask which do iterative coarse-to-fine segmentation, but they apply refinement globally rather than selectively per instance. This paper's dynamic selection avoids refining easy instances. 

- Compared to one-stage methods like YOLACT and BlendMask, this paper follows a two-stage detection+segmentation paradigm like Mask R-CNN. The mask prediction head is improved while still building on two-stage detection.

- The dual-level FPN proposed in this paper is unique in constructing an additional region-based FPN pathway along with the normal image-based FPN to refine masks. This allows integrating multi-scale information.

- The experiments show sizable gains over strong Mask R-CNN baselines on COCO and Cityscapes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The gains are achieved with modest extra computation compared to prior art.

In summary, the idea of dynamic mask selection and the dual-level FPN design make valuable contributions compared to prior work in instance segmentation. The paper demonstrates better efficiency and accuracy trade-offs.
