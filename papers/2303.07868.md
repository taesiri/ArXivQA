# [DynaMask: Dynamic Mask Selection for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07868)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to achieve high-quality instance segmentation while maintaining high efficiency. 

Specifically, the authors propose a method to dynamically select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance in an image, rather than using a uniform mask resolution for all instances. The key ideas are:

1) Develop a dual-level FPN to gradually increase the mask resolution, so that "hard" instances can be segmented with high-resolution masks to capture fine details. 

2) Introduce a lightweight Mask Switch Module to predict the optimal mask resolution for each instance based on its difficulty, so that "easy" instances can be segmented efficiently with low-resolution masks.

The main hypothesis is that by adaptively assigning masks of different resolutions, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency compared to using a uniform mask size. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic mask selection approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called DynaMask for dynamic mask selection in instance segmentation. The key ideas are:

- A dual-level Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is developed to gradually increase the mask resolution, allowing high-quality segmentation especially for objects with irregular shapes and complex boundaries. It contains an image-level FPN (i-FPN) and a region-level FPN (r-FPN). The r-FPN incrementally incorporates contextual and detailed information from i-FPN for coarse-to-fine mask prediction.

- A Mask Switch Module (MSM) is proposed to dynamically select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance. It predicts a mask resolution from a set of candidates to balance accuracy and efficiency. Larger masks are assigned to "hard" instances while smaller masks are assigned to "easy" ones. 

- Extensive experiments show DynaMask brings significant and consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-arts with a moderate computation overhead. It outperforms Mask R-CNN by 2.9% AP on COCO with ResNet-50 backbone.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a flexible mask selection framework DynaMask to achieve high-quality instance segmentation with adaptive computation cost. The dual-level FPN explores multi-scale features for mask refinement while MSM dynamically adjusts the mask resolution based on instance properties.
