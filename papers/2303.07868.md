# [DynaMask: Dynamic Mask Selection for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07868)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to achieve high-quality instance segmentation while maintaining high efficiency. 

Specifically, the authors propose a method to dynamically select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance in an image, rather than using a uniform mask resolution for all instances. The key ideas are:

1) Develop a dual-level FPN to gradually increase the mask resolution, so that "hard" instances can be segmented with high-resolution masks to capture fine details. 

2) Introduce a lightweight Mask Switch Module to predict the optimal mask resolution for each instance based on its difficulty, so that "easy" instances can be segmented efficiently with low-resolution masks.

The main hypothesis is that by adaptively assigning masks of different resolutions, the proposed method can achieve a better trade-off between segmentation accuracy and efficiency compared to using a uniform mask size. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic mask selection approach.
