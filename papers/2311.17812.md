# [DAP: Domain-aware Prompt Learning for Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17812)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Domain-Aware Prompt Learning (DAP) to bridge the domain gap between pretrained vision-and-language models and VLN tasks. DAP introduces soft visual prompts, learned from in-domain images and text pairs generated by CLIP, into the input space of the visual encoder of pretrained models like PREVALENT. These prompts serve as domain-specific guidance to adapt models to identify objects and scenes in VLN environments. DAP uses a low-cost prompt tuning approach where only the prompts and an MLP prediction head are updated, while keeping the pretrained model fixed. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art navigation performance. For example, DAP improves the validation unseen success rate and SPL by 2% on R2R over strong baselines. Additional analyses verify that DAP is model-agnostic, working well when applied to different pretrained models like OSCAR and PREVALENT. The core ideas of learning soft visual prompts from in-domain data and using prompt tuning to rapidly adapt models show promise in reducing the domain gap for VLN.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a domain-aware prompt learning framework called DAP that injects soft visual prompts learned from in-domain images into the visual encoder of pretrained vision-and-language models to enhance their ability to recognize objects and scenes in VLN tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel and model-agnostic framework called Domain-aware Prompt Learning (DAP). Specifically:

1) DAP introduces prompt learning to inject in-domain visual knowledge into the visual encoder of pretrained vision-and-language models. This helps adapt these models to better capture object-level and scene-level semantics needed for VLN tasks.

2) DAP learns soft visual prompts from an automatically generated in-domain image-text dataset. The prompts provide domain-specific guidance to enhance cross-modal alignment for VLN scenes. 

3) DAP uses a fast and low-cost prompt tuning method to adapt pretrained models. Only the visual prompts and an MLP head are updated, while keeping the model parameters frozen.

4) Experiments show DAP boosts performance over state-of-the-art methods on both R2R and REVERIE datasets. It also demonstrates promising generalization ability across different pretrained models.

In summary, DAP contributes an efficient prompt learning approach to reduce the domain gap between pretraining datasets and VLN datasets for adapting pretrained vision-and-language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Vision-and-language navigation (VLN): The paper focuses on the task of an agent navigating in environments by following natural language instructions.

- Domain gap: There is a considerable domain gap between models pretrained on web data vs VLN datasets, which the authors aim to address. 

- Prompt learning: The paper proposes using prompt learning to inject visual knowledge into pretrained models to adapt them for VLN.

- Soft visual prompts: The core idea is to learn soft visual prompts from in-domain data to provide guidance to adapt models to VLN scenes. The prompts are optimized to understand object-level and scene-level semantics.

- Model-agnostic: The proposed Domain-aware Prompt Learning (DAP) framework is designed to be model-agnostic - it can work with different pretrained vision-and-language models.

- Low-cost tuning: DAP allows adapting pretrained models via low-cost prompt tuning by only updating the prompt parameters rather than full fine-tuning.

So in summary, key terms are vision-and-language navigation, domain gap, prompt learning, soft visual prompts, model-agnostic framework, and low-cost tuning.
