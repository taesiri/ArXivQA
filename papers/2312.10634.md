# [Anomaly Score: Evaluating Generative Models and Individual Generated   Images based on Complexity and Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing metrics that evaluate generated images by comparing features between real and fake images have limitations - they can be inconsistent with human perception of image quality and naturalness. 

- Simply measuring feature distances is insufficient to assess naturalness of generated images. Two images can have the same feature distance from a real image but differ significantly in naturalness.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose two new metrics - complexity and vulnerability - to characterize representation space around images. 

- Complexity measures how non-linear the representation space is around an image based on curvature of feature changes from adding noise. Real images tend to have higher complexity in their representation space.

- Vulnerability reflects how easily image features change under adversarial attack. Real images tend to have lower vulnerability. 

- Use joint distribution of complexity and vulnerability between real and generated images to define an Anomaly Score (AS) to evaluate generative models.

- Define Anomaly Score for Individual images (AS-i) using ratio of vulnerability to complexity to assess individual generated images.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate representation space around generated images has lower complexity and higher vulnerability compared to real images.

- Propose AS and AS-i metrics that align better with human judgement of image quality than existing metrics.

- Show AS effectively evaluates quality of various generative models.

- Demonstrate AS-i correlates well with human assessment of naturalness for individual generated images.

In summary, the paper proposes more effective techniques to evaluate generative models and individual generated images by examining complexity and vulnerability of the representation space. The metrics align better with human perceptual judgements.
