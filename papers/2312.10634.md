# [Anomaly Score: Evaluating Generative Models and Individual Generated   Images based on Complexity and Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing metrics that evaluate generated images by comparing features between real and fake images have limitations - they can be inconsistent with human perception of image quality and naturalness. 

- Simply measuring feature distances is insufficient to assess naturalness of generated images. Two images can have the same feature distance from a real image but differ significantly in naturalness.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose two new metrics - complexity and vulnerability - to characterize representation space around images. 

- Complexity measures how non-linear the representation space is around an image based on curvature of feature changes from adding noise. Real images tend to have higher complexity in their representation space.

- Vulnerability reflects how easily image features change under adversarial attack. Real images tend to have lower vulnerability. 

- Use joint distribution of complexity and vulnerability between real and generated images to define an Anomaly Score (AS) to evaluate generative models.

- Define Anomaly Score for Individual images (AS-i) using ratio of vulnerability to complexity to assess individual generated images.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate representation space around generated images has lower complexity and higher vulnerability compared to real images.

- Propose AS and AS-i metrics that align better with human judgement of image quality than existing metrics.

- Show AS effectively evaluates quality of various generative models.

- Demonstrate AS-i correlates well with human assessment of naturalness for individual generated images.

In summary, the paper proposes more effective techniques to evaluate generative models and individual generated images by examining complexity and vulnerability of the representation space. The metrics align better with human perceptual judgements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new metrics called anomaly score (AS) and anomaly score for individual images (AS-i) to evaluate generative models and individual generated images respectively by examining the complexity and vulnerability of the representation space around images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduction of two new metrics - complexity and vulnerability - to examine the characteristics of the representation space around images. Complexity measures how non-linear the representation space is with respect to linear input changes. Vulnerability captures how easily the extracted feature changes due to adversarial input changes. 

2. Proposal of a new metric called anomaly score (AS) to evaluate generative models in terms of naturalness based on complexity and vulnerability. AS measures the difference in joint distributions of complexity and vulnerability between real and generated images using 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics.

3. Suggestion of anomaly score for individual images (AS-i) to assess generated images individually. AS-i is defined as the ratio of vulnerability to complexity for each image. Subjective evaluation shows AS-i aligns better with human judgement compared to existing metrics in evaluating naturalness of individual images.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of new metrics utilizing complexity and vulnerability to evaluate generative models and individual generated images in terms of naturalness. Both proposed metrics demonstrate better correlation with human perception than previous methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Complexity - A measure of how non-linear the representation space is around an image based on how feature vectors change when random noise is added to the image. 

- Vulnerability - A measure of how easily an image's feature vector changes when adversarial perturbations are applied, indicating unnaturalness.

- Anomaly score (AS) - A proposed metric to evaluate generative models based on the difference in joint distributions of complexity and vulnerability between real and generated images.

- Anomaly score for individual images (AS-i) - A proposed metric to evaluate the naturalness of individual generated images using the ratio of their vulnerability to complexity.

- Representation space - The space of features extracted from images using pre-trained neural network models. Examining properties of this space can reveal anomalies in generated images.

- Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic - Used to compare distributions of complexity and vulnerability between real and generated datasets in the proposed AS metric. 

- Subjective tests - Human evaluation experiments used to validate proposed metrics by having participants judge naturalness of generated images.

The key ideas explored are using complexity and vulnerability characteristics to examine the relationship between the input image space and representation space in order to identify anomalies in generated images and generative models. The proposed AS and AS-i metrics based on these concepts are shown to align well with human judgement.
