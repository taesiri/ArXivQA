# [ConstitutionalExperts: Training a Mixture of Principle-based Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are very capable at various NLP tasks when given the right prompt, but writing effective prompts remains difficult and tedious. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces ConstitutionalExperts, a method to learn a mixture of principle-based prompts tailored to different semantic regions of the training data. 

- It works by first clustering the training data using embeddings. For each cluster, an expert prompt made of principles is initialized and then incrementally improved by sampling incorrect predictions, asking the LLM to propose principle edits, and validating the changes.

- At inference time, the input is matched to the most similar expert prompt using embedding distances to cluster centroids. This allows selectively applying specialized prompts.

Main Contributions:

- ConstitutionalExperts method to learn interpretable principle-based prompt mixtures for improved performance over single prompt optimization techniques.

- Novel prompt optimization approach with targeted principle edits rather than full rewrite. Allows incremental improvement.

- Using mixture-of-experts architecture by learning separate expert prompts for semantic clusters. Improves over generalist prompts.

- Evaluation showing ConstitutionalExperts with MoE outperforms state-of-the-art optimization methods like ProTeGi and PromptBreeder across 6 text classification tasks. The MoE approach also broadly boosts other prompt optimization techniques.

In summary, the key ideas are optimized principle-based prompt mixtures that specialize for semantic subdomains, outperforming other prompt tuning approaches. The incremental targeted editing and selective application provide improvements over existing methods.
