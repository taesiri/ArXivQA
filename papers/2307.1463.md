# [Hybrid two-level MCMC for Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1463)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we leverage machine learning surrogate models to accelerate Bayesian inverse problems while also ensuring accuracy comparable to using only numerical models?The key points are:- Bayesian inverse problems require repeated evaluations of computationally expensive forward models, making them challenging to solve with traditional MCMC methods. - Machine learning surrogate models like neural networks can evaluate much faster, but may lack the accuracy of numerical models.- The paper proposes a hybrid two-level MCMC approach that uses a machine learning surrogate model for the bulk of evaluations, but also samples differences from an accurate numerical model to correct errors. - Theoretically, this hybrid approach can achieve the same accuracy as using only the numerical model, with just a small fraction of the computational cost.- Numerical experiments on various PDE-based inverse problems demonstrate the potential for machine learning acceleration while preserving accuracy.So in summary, the central question is how to get the best of both worlds - fast machine learning surrogates and accurate numerical models - for Bayesian inverse problems through a hybrid MCMC approach. The paper provides both theory and experiments to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid two-level MCMC method for Bayesian inverse problems that combines a machine learning surrogate model with a numerical model. The key points are:- The paper proposes using a machine learning model (e.g. neural network) as a fast surrogate model to run a base MCMC chain. This exploits the speed of ML models for fast inference.- To correct the errors of the ML model, a second numerical MCMC chain is run to sample the difference between the ML model and the numerical model. - Theoretical analysis shows this two-level approach can achieve the same accuracy as using the expensive numerical model alone, but with far fewer numerical model evaluations.- The method is applicable to various ML models like neural networks or neural operators, and various numerical methods like finite elements or spectral methods.- Numerical experiments on elliptic equations, nonlinear reaction-diffusion, and Navier Stokes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid two-level MCMC method.In summary, the key contribution is a novel hybrid scheme that combines fast ML surrogate models with accurate numerical models in a two-level MCMC framework to solve Bayesian inverse PDE problems efficiently and accurately. Theoretical analysis and numerical results support the advantages of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-level hybrid MCMC approach that leverages fast inference with machine learning surrogate models and corrects errors statistically with a small number of numerical solver samples to efficiently and accurately solve Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on hybrid two-level MCMC compares to other research in Bayesian inverse problems:- Leverages machine learning models as surrogates: Using neural network models as fast surrogate models for Bayesian inverse problems has become more popular recently. This paper follows that trend and uses models like physics-informed neural networks and neural operators.- Combines ML surrogates with numerical models: A key contribution is using a two-level approach to combine the ML surrogate with a more accurate but slower numerical model, getting the best of both. This hybrid approach is novel compared to just using one or the other.- Provides theoretical analysis: The paper includes theoretical analysis of the two-level estimator error which is important but often lacking in ML papers. This helps justify and explain the approach rigorously.- Considers complex PDE-based models: Many examples involve challenging PDE-constrained inverse problems like Navier-Stokes and nonlinear diffusion, going beyond simpler toy examples.- Focuses on posterior accuracy: The goal is accurate posterior inference, not just fast forwarding. The two-level approach aims to correct errors in the posterior from the ML surrogate.- Builds on multilevel MCMC ideas: The two-level concept extends previous work on multilevel MCMC to leverage ML surrogates. This connects the method to established MCMC theory.Overall, the paper makes nice contributions in bringing together ML and traditional numerical methods for Bayesian inverse problems. The theoretical and empirical results on improving posterior accuracy using the two-level approach are novel and useful compared to related work. The approach seems promising for tackling challenging problems at scale.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing theoretical error bounds and convergence analysis for the proposed hybrid two-level MCMC method. The authors mention the lack of rigorous mathematical analysis for neural network models as a limitation. More theoretical analysis of the accuracy and convergence of the hybrid method would be valuable.- Testing the hybrid approach on more complex and higher-dimensional problems. The authors demonstrated results on some 2D PDE-constrained inverse problems. Applying the method to more challenging 3D problems and systems with many more parameters would be interesting.- Exploring the use of different types of neural network surrogate models, such as physics-informed neural networks. The authors suggest neural operators as promising surrogates, but other neural network architectures could be investigated.- Developing adaptive or iterative approaches to refine the neural network surrogate online during the MCMC sampling. Rather than using a fixed pre-trained surrogate model, adapting the model during MCMC could potentially improve accuracy.- Extending the method to handle non-Gaussian priors and posteriors. The theoretical derivation currently relies on Gaussian assumptions. Generalizing to non-Gaussian cases would broaden applicability.- Comparing the method to other approaches for accelerating MCMC, such as multi-level Monte Carlo and surrogate-based MCMC methods. Comparative studies could elucidate the relative merits of different acceleration techniques.- Applying the hybrid approach to real-world Bayesian inverse problems from science and engineering, such as subsurface flow modeling or image reconstruction problems. Testing on practical applications would demonstrate usefulness.In summary, the authors propose a two-level MCMC approach using neural network surrogates that shows promise, but further theoretical analysis, testing on complex problems, comparison to other methods, and real-world applications would help develop the technique and understand its capabilities and limitations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a two-level hybrid MCMC approach to solve Bayesian inverse problems governed by PDEs, leveraging both machine learning surrogate models and numerical solvers. It first introduces the Bayesian inverse problem formulation and discusses numerical discretization approximations. Then it describes using neural network models as fast surrogate models but notes they may have residual errors compared to numerical solvers. The key contribution is a hybrid method that runs an MCMC chain with the ML surrogate model, and another small MCMC chain to sample the difference between the ML and numerical models, correcting the ML error statistically. Theoretical analysis shows this two-level approach maintains the accuracy of using the expensive numerical solver, with minimal additional samples. Experiments on elliptic, reaction-diffusion, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach. Overall, this paper provides a way to accelerate MCMC for Bayesian inverse PDE problems by using ML models, while still ensuring numerical accuracy.
