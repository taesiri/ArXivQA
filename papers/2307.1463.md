# [Hybrid two-level MCMC for Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.1463)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we leverage machine learning surrogate models to accelerate Bayesian inverse problems while also ensuring accuracy comparable to using only numerical models?The key points are:- Bayesian inverse problems require repeated evaluations of computationally expensive forward models, making them challenging to solve with traditional MCMC methods. - Machine learning surrogate models like neural networks can evaluate much faster, but may lack the accuracy of numerical models.- The paper proposes a hybrid two-level MCMC approach that uses a machine learning surrogate model for the bulk of evaluations, but also samples differences from an accurate numerical model to correct errors. - Theoretically, this hybrid approach can achieve the same accuracy as using only the numerical model, with just a small fraction of the computational cost.- Numerical experiments on various PDE-based inverse problems demonstrate the potential for machine learning acceleration while preserving accuracy.So in summary, the central question is how to get the best of both worlds - fast machine learning surrogates and accurate numerical models - for Bayesian inverse problems through a hybrid MCMC approach. The paper provides both theory and experiments to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid two-level MCMC method for Bayesian inverse problems that combines a machine learning surrogate model with a numerical model. The key points are:- The paper proposes using a machine learning model (e.g. neural network) as a fast surrogate model to run a base MCMC chain. This exploits the speed of ML models for fast inference.- To correct the errors of the ML model, a second numerical MCMC chain is run to sample the difference between the ML model and the numerical model. - Theoretical analysis shows this two-level approach can achieve the same accuracy as using the expensive numerical model alone, but with far fewer numerical model evaluations.- The method is applicable to various ML models like neural networks or neural operators, and various numerical methods like finite elements or spectral methods.- Numerical experiments on elliptic equations, nonlinear reaction-diffusion, and Navier Stokes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid two-level MCMC method.In summary, the key contribution is a novel hybrid scheme that combines fast ML surrogate models with accurate numerical models in a two-level MCMC framework to solve Bayesian inverse PDE problems efficiently and accurately. Theoretical analysis and numerical results support the advantages of this approach.
