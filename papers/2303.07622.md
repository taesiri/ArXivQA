# [RE-MOVE: An Adaptive Policy Design for Robotic Navigation Tasks in   Dynamic Environments via Language-Based Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07622)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How can reinforcement learning policies be adapted at test-time to handle changes in the environment that were not seen during training? The paper notes that RL policies often fail to generalize to new obstacles/configurations during real-world deployment.

2) When should a robot request human assistance (via feedback) to handle unfamiliar situations? The paper aims to develop a principled approach to deciding when to query a human, rather than asking for constant guidance. 

3) How should human feedback be incorporated to adjust the policy on-the-fly? The paper explores using natural language instructions and converting them to action sequences.

4) How does the design of the observation/input space impact uncertainty estimation and the ability to detect novel scenarios? The paper studies different observation configurations and their effect on quantifying epistemic uncertainty.

In summary, the central focus seems to be on improving test-time adaptation of RL policies by leveraging human feedback. The key research questions revolve around deciding when to request human guidance, how to interpret it, and how the agent's observation space impacts uncertainty-driven learning. The overall goal is to enable robots to handle novel objects and environments not seen during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be proposing a new approach called RE-MOVE (Request help and MOVE on) for enabling reinforcement learning policies to adapt to changes in the environment during real-time deployment. 

The key ideas presented are:

- Using epistemic uncertainty quantification to determine when the policy is uncertain and needs to request human feedback. This allows the robot to identify when it encounters situations that differ from the training data.

- Leveraging natural language feedback from humans to guide the robot's actions when uncertainty is high. This allows incorporating human knowledge to handle novel scenarios.

- Demonstrating the approach in both simulated and real-world robot navigation tasks. The results show that RE-MOVE enables robots to successfully navigate environments with obstacles and configurations not seen during training by requesting help from humans when needed.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing a method for reinforcement learning policies to adapt at test time by monitoring uncertainty and incorporating human feedback through language. The experiments demonstrate that this approach allows robots to handle novel situations and continue to reach goals despite changes in the environment.

The paper proposes a novel approach called RE-MOVE that uses language-based human feedback to adapt reinforcement learning policies for robot navigation to dynamic changes in the environment during real-time deployment.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- The paper focuses on enabling reinforcement learning policies to adapt to changes in real-world environments during deployment. Much prior RL research has focused on training policies that work well under the assumptions of the training environment, but often fail to generalize. This paper tackles the challenge of adapting policies post-training.

- The idea of using human feedback to improve RL agents is not new, but this paper proposes a novel framework (RE-MOVE) for deciding when to request feedback and how to incorporate it. The use of epistemic uncertainty estimation and changepoint detection to trigger requests is a unique contribution.

- For interpreting natural language feedback, the authors take advantage of recent advances in large language models like GPT-3 rather than training a new model from scratch. The few-shot learning approach allows efficacy with minimal training data.

- Most prior work on uncertainty estimation and human-in-the-loop RL has focused on simulated environments. This paper demonstrates the benefits on real-world robot navigation tasks, which is an important step towards practical applicability.

- Compared to prior work using human feedback for robot navigation, the focus on dynamic adaptation to unseen objects and perceptually challenging scenarios is novel. The evaluations in deceiving real-world environments highlight this contribution.

In summary, this paper makes several incremental advances over related work, with the novel contributions being 1) the overall RE-MOVE framework and uncertainty-triggering approach 2) demonstration on real-world robot navigation tasks and 3) handling of perceptually challenging test scenarios unseen during training. The results show promise for improving generalization of learned policies.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing dedicated language models for robotic navigation tasks, rather than relying on general language models like ChatGPT. Training language models specifically for interpreting grounded language in navigation contexts could improve performance.

- Incorporating other forms of human feedback beyond text instructions, such as speech commands or image annotations. This could provide more natural and flexible ways for humans to give feedback to the robot.

- Exploring ways to reduce the dependence on human feedback over time as the robot gains more experience. For example, the robot could learn to recognize when it needs help less frequently.

- Evaluating the approach on more complex and dynamic real-world environments to further demonstrate its capabilities. Testing on environments with diverse obstacles and changing conditions would be valuable.

- Investigating methods to improve uncertainty estimation and make it more tightly coupled with the policy learning. More accurate uncertainty measures could improve determining when to query the human expert.

- Developing sim2real techniques to improve how policies trained in simulation transfer to the real world. Advances here could reduce the need for real-world policy fine-tuning.

- Exploring alternative observation space designs that provide useful signals for uncertainty estimation while remaining invariant to task-irrelevant scene variations.

- Studying multi-modal sensor fusion rather than just LiDAR to improve perception and state estimation. Combining different modalities could make policies more robust.

In summary, the authors point to several interesting avenues for advancing language-guided robotic navigation and improving the generalization of learned policies. Developing more capable language interfaces, improving sim2real transfer, and investigating observation space design seem like particularly valuable directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach called RE-MOVE (REquest help and MOVE on) for adapting reinforcement learning policies to real-time changes in the environment. The key ideas are to leverage epistemic uncertainty to determine when to request human feedback, and to use language-based feedback to update the policy. The authors design the observation space to enable proper uncertainty estimation, using goal-conditioned observations rather than full visibility. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified with an ensemble method, and increases in uncertainty trigger requests for feedback. The language-based feedback is interpreted with an efficient prompt design strategy that leverages GPT-3's few-shot learning capabilities. Experiments in synthetic grid worlds and a simulated outdoor environment demonstrate that RE-MOVE successfully adapts policies trained without obstacles to avoid new obstacles encountered at test-time, using only a few instances of human feedback. Real robot experiments further validate the approach for handling perceptually challenging real-world navigation scenarios involving deceptive objects like tablecloths. Overall, RE-MOVE provides an effective method to make reinforcement learning policies more adaptable at deployment time using intuitive human assistance.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes a new approach called RE-MOVE (REquest help and MOVE on) for adapting reinforcement learning based policies to real-time changes in robotic navigation environments. The key ideas are to leverage epistemic uncertainty to determine when to request human feedback, and use natural language interactions to incorporate the feedback into the trained policy. 

The authors first discuss observation space design and how to characterize epistemic uncertainty for navigation policies. They find goal-conditioned observations work best to identify unpredictable obstacles at test time. A changepoint detection algorithm monitors uncertainty over the episode to identify when help is needed. For incorporating natural language feedback, they use a zero-shot learning approach with GPT-3 via prompt engineering to map instructions to action sequences. Experiments in synthetic environments and on a real robot demonstrate RE-MOVE adapts better to unseen obstacles compared to baselines, increasing success rate up to 80% in challenging scenarios by leveraging human feedback when perceptually ambiguous objects confuse the sensor-based policy.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called RE-MOVE (REquest and MOVE on) to enable reinforcement learning policies to adapt to changes in the environment during real-time deployment. RE-MOVE uses epistemic uncertainty quantification to identify when the policy is uncertain about its predictions. At these times, it prompts a human for feedback in the form of natural language instructions. These instructions are converted to sequences of actions using a ChatGPT model designed for this navigation task. The actions provided by the human feedback are incorporated into the original policy trajectory. This allows the policy to avoid obstacles or objects that were not seen during training time. By leveraging epistemic uncertainty and human feedback, RE-MOVE is able to adapt the policy in real-time to prevent failures. The approach is evaluated in both synthetic grid worlds and real-world robot navigation tasks, demonstrating improved performance over baselines. The key innovations are the uncertainty quantification tailored to the navigation task and efficient incorporation of natural language feedback using ChatGPT.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the paper is addressing the challenge of adapting trained reinforcement learning policies for robotic navigation to changes in the environment during real-time deployment. Specifically, it focuses on two key issues:

1) Determining when a robot should request feedback/assistance from a human operator when encountering unexpected changes in the environment.

2) Designing an effective framework for the robot to interpret natural language instructions from the human operator and incorporate that feedback to adapt its navigation policy. 

The paper proposes a new approach called RE-MOVE to address these challenges. The key ideas include:

- Using epistemic uncertainty estimates to identify when the robot's confidence in its action predictions is low due to changes in the environment. This helps determine optimal timing for requesting human feedback.

- Employing natural language processing and prompt design with large language models like GPT-3 to enable the robot to interpret free-form human instructions and convert them into executable actions. 

- Integrating these capabilities into an adaptive framework that allows on-the-fly policy adaptation during deployment without full re-training.

Overall, the paper tackles the limited adaptability of learned robotic navigation policies to new environments through a human-in-the-loop approach guided by uncertainty estimates and natural language grounding. The proposed RE-MOVE methodology aims to make such systems more robust and usable in the real world.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called RE-MOVE (REquest and MOVE on) to enable reinforcement learning policies to adapt at test time to changes in the environment without retraining. RE-MOVE monitors the epistemic uncertainty in the policy's predictions to identify when the policy encounters novel or unexpected situations. At these times of high uncertainty, RE-MOVE prompts a human for natural language assistance.

This allows the policy to incorporate the new information and adapt its behavior accordingly to successfully navigate the environment. The authors demonstrate RE-MOVE in simulation and real-world experiments, showing improved navigation performance in challenging scenarios with dynamic obstacles or misleading sensor data. Key benefits include higher goal attainment rates and shorter paths compared to alternative approaches.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called RE-MOVE (REquest and MOVE on) to enable reinforcement learning policies to adapt at test time to changes in the environment without retraining. RE-MOVE monitors the epistemic uncertainty of the policy to determine when to request human feedback. It uses an ensemble-based Bayesian inference method to quantify uncertainty. When uncertainty exceeds a threshold detected by a change point algorithm, RE-MOVE requests natural language-based feedback from a human. To interpret this feedback, RE-MOVE leverages recent large language models in a zero-shot learning paradigm with prompt engineering. The converted feedback is used to adapt the original policy on-the-fly. Experiments in synthetic and real-world robotic navigation environments demonstrate that RE-MOVE successfully adapts policies to avoid failures and reach goals more efficiently compared to baseline methods, especially in perceptually challenging cases like thin obstacles invisible to LIDAR. The key innovations are the uncertainty quantification tailored to navigation, efficient natural language grounding, and demonstration of test-time adaptation without retraining.
