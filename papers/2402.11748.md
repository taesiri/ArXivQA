# [Low-power SNN-based audio source localisation using a Hilbert Transform   spike encoding scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sound source localization is important for applications like virtual reality, consumer audio, etc. It is usually done using beamforming algorithms that phase-shift and combine microphone signals to estimate direction of arrival (DoA). 
- Traditional beamforming algorithms require narrowband signals and use filterbanks for wideband audio. This is computationally demanding, making integration into low-power IoT devices difficult.
- Existing spiking neural network (SNN) methods for sound localization have limited accuracy and rely on binaural cues rather than microphone arrays.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel SNN-based sound localization method for arbitrary microphone arrays that operates directly on wideband signals.
- Apply a Short-Time Hilbert Transform (STHT) to extract the analytic signal. Show the phase of the analytic signal grows linearly even for wideband audio.
- Propose Hilbert beamforming to combine the analytic microphone signals using beamforming weights derived from the covariance of analytic signals. Works for both narrowband and wideband without needing filterbanks.

- Introduce Robust Zero-Crossing Conjugate (RZCC) spike encoding to encode the phase information of the analytic signal into events. Allows implementation using an SNN.

- Implement Hilbert beamforming and DoA inference using an SNN with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Approximates averaging of signals using low-pass filtering properties of LIF neurons.

Contributions:
- First SNN-based sound localization method for arbitrary microphone arrays that works directly on wideband signals.
- Novel Hilbert transform based beamforming approach that unifies narrowband and wideband localization without needing filterbanks.
- New RZCC spike encoding method to accurately capture phase information for SNN processing.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy compared to SNN and traditional methods, using far less compute resources.
- Show 10x lower power consumption compared to traditional super-resolution methods when deployed on ultra-low-power SNN hardware.

In summary, the paper introduces a complete sound localization solution designed specifically for low-power SNN implementation that achieves comparable accuracy to traditional systems while being far more efficient. The new Hilbert beamforming approach also promises to improve traditional DSP methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel sound source localization method using Hilbert transform for phase extraction from microphone signals, an efficient spike encoding scheme, and an SNN-based beamforming approach, demonstrating high accuracy and low power consumption suitable for deployment on neuromorphic hardware.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel beamforming method based on the Hilbert transform that can work effectively on both narrowband and wideband signals. This avoids the need for computationally demanding narrowband decomposition using FFT/filterbanks.

2. A short-time approximation of the Hilbert transform (STHT) that allows its online streaming computation.

3. A robust zero-crossing spike encoding method (RZCC) that accurately captures the phase information in the analytic signal obtained from the STHT.

4. An SNN architecture for audio localization that uses the proposed STHT and RZCC encoding. This achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among SNN methods, while being much more computationally and energy efficient compared to traditional narrowband methods like MUSIC.

5. A demonstration of the approach on low-power SNN hardware (Xylo chip), showing the feasibility of accurate audio localization at very low power consumption. 

In summary, the paper shows how an SNN solution can be designed from first principles to match a signal processing task like beamforming. By co-optimizing the encoding and network architecture, excellent accuracy and power efficiency is achieved. The Hilbert transform based beamforming is also shown to be useful even for traditional DSP implementations.

The paper presents a novel method for sound source localization in microphone arrays using Hilbert transform-based beamforming implemented efficiently in low-power spiking neural networks.

8. The method is deployed on the Xylo inference architecture. What are the key considerations in quantizing the SNN parameters for deployment on low-precision integer hardware like Xylo?

9. Compare the compute resources and power requirements of the proposed Hilbert SNN method against state-of-the-art narrowband beamforming techniques like MUSIC. 

10. The paper focuses on far-field sound sources. How would near-field sources or reverberation affect the proposed localization method? What modifications can be made to improve robustness?
