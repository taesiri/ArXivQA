# [Low-power SNN-based audio source localisation using a Hilbert Transform   spike encoding scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11748)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sound source localization is important for applications like virtual reality, consumer audio, etc. It is usually done using beamforming algorithms that phase-shift and combine microphone signals to estimate direction of arrival (DoA). 
- Traditional beamforming algorithms require narrowband signals and use filterbanks for wideband audio. This is computationally demanding, making integration into low-power IoT devices difficult.
- Existing spiking neural network (SNN) methods for sound localization have limited accuracy and rely on binaural cues rather than microphone arrays.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a novel SNN-based sound localization method for arbitrary microphone arrays that operates directly on wideband signals.
- Apply a Short-Time Hilbert Transform (STHT) to extract the analytic signal. Show the phase of the analytic signal grows linearly even for wideband audio.
- Propose Hilbert beamforming to combine the analytic microphone signals using beamforming weights derived from the covariance of analytic signals. Works for both narrowband and wideband without needing filterbanks.

- Introduce Robust Zero-Crossing Conjugate (RZCC) spike encoding to encode the phase information of the analytic signal into events. Allows implementation using an SNN.

- Implement Hilbert beamforming and DoA inference using an SNN with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Approximates averaging of signals using low-pass filtering properties of LIF neurons.

Contributions:
- First SNN-based sound localization method for arbitrary microphone arrays that works directly on wideband signals.
- Novel Hilbert transform based beamforming approach that unifies narrowband and wideband localization without needing filterbanks.
- New RZCC spike encoding method to accurately capture phase information for SNN processing.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy compared to SNN and traditional methods, using far less compute resources.
- Show 10x lower power consumption compared to traditional super-resolution methods when deployed on ultra-low-power SNN hardware.

In summary, the paper introduces a complete sound localization solution designed specifically for low-power SNN implementation that achieves comparable accuracy to traditional systems while being far more efficient. The new Hilbert beamforming approach also promises to improve traditional DSP methods.
