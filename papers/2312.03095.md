# [Understanding Environmental Posts: Sentiment and Emotion Analysis of   Social Media Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to analyze public perception and sentiment towards environmental issues using social media data from Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube over a 10-year period (2013-2023). Specifically, it seeks to understand how public attitudes and emotions regarding ecological problems have evolved over time and identify factors influencing awareness.

Methodology:  
The authors collect over 300k labeled tweets for training a sentiment classifier and scrape 284k tweets, 38k Reddit posts, and 5k YouTube comments related to the environment for testing. After pre-processing the text data, they employ Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to build a sentiment analysis model and use NRCLex to detect emotions like fear, anticipation, etc. Additionally, they utilize topic modeling to uncover discussion themes.

Key Findings:
- Negative sentiment is much more prevalent (53-55%) than positive (30-45%) or neutral (14-20%) across all platforms.  
- Climate change dominates the conversation across social networks, indicating huge global concern. Other recurring topics are air quality, emissions, plastic waste, and recycling.
- On Twitter and YouTube, fear, anticipation and surprise prevail. On Reddit, fear, anger, and surprise are more dominant over time. This showcases the wide range of public reactions.
- Accuracy of 65% on a human-annotated dataset demonstrates PMI's effectiveness over methods like VADER for environment tweets.

Main Contributions:  
- Analyzes multiple platforms to mitigate bias and gain comprehensive insights 
- Examines evolving trends over 10 years to understand shifts in public opinions
- Complements sentiment with emotion analysis for deeper affective responses
- Focuses on popular posts to gauge wider community reactions 

Overall, the analysis offers valuable understanding into nuanced public perceptions regarding environmental challenges. The insights can inform policymaking to raise awareness and address concerns more effectively through social media.
