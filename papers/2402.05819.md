# [Integrating Self-supervised Speech Model with Pseudo Word-level Targets   from Visually-grounded Speech Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent self-supervised speech models like HuBERT show limited performance on spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require semantic comprehension at the word level. 
- Existing methods rely on additional speech-text data or word transcripts as intermediate targets, which is costly.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Pseudo-Word HuBERT (PW-HuBERT) to incorporate pseudo word-level targets into model pretraining without needing speech-text data.
- Leverage word boundaries from VG-HuBERT, a visually grounded speech model, to generate pseudo word segments. Apply mean pooling and clustering on segments to create pseudo word-level targets.
- Introduce single PW-HuBERT that predicts pseudo targets with additional layers, and hierarchical PW-HuBERT that has both frame and word-level objectives.

Main Contributions:
- First work to leverage unsupervised word discovery model for speech SSL model pretraining.
- Demonstrate benefits of joint training with frame and word-level units for capturing semantics.
- Show strong improvements over HuBERT baseline on multiple SLU tasks like SLUE, SLUE Phase-2, SNIPS and ZeroSpeech semantics.
- Analyze impact of ground truth boundaries and effect of freezing HuBERT weights.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel PW-HuBERT model to inject pseudo word-level supervision without paired text, leading to gains in SLU tasks. The hierarchical training with frame and word units is shown to be beneficial for semantic understanding.
