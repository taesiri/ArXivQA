# [Simultaneously Achieving Group Exposure Fairness and Within-Group   Meritocracy in Stochastic Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05575)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing approaches to fairness in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) focus on exposure guarantees for individual arms. 
- When arms are naturally grouped (e.g. by attributes like gender, ethnicity), group-level fairness is a more natural notion. 
- However, just ensuring group fairness can still lead to biases favoring certain arms within a group. 
- There is a need to ensure both group fairness across arms as well as fairness within groups.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the notion of Bi-Level Fairness (BF) in stochastic MABs:
    - Level 1: Guarantees minimum exposure to each group of arms (called GEF).
    - Level 2: Ensures meritocratic fairness (MF) within each group, so that arms are pulled proportional to their merit.
- The paper proposes an algorithm called BF-UCB that adapts the UCB algorithm to achieve BF by:
    - Using a group selection strategy to ensure anytime GEF.
    - Using an arm selection strategy to ensure MF within chosen groups.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to formally introduce the notion of group exposure fairness (GEF) in stochastic MABs.
- Provides a new Bi-Level fairness (BF) notion combining GEF and meritocratic fairness (MF).
- Proposes BF-UCB algorithm that achieves BF by ensuring anytime GEF and MF within groups.  
- Shows that regret can be decomposed into group fairness regret and meritocratic fairness regret.
- Proves BF-UCB achieves optimal regret bound of O(âˆšT).
- Empirically validates BF-UCB by comparisons with baselines on regret, group fairness and exposure.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in ensuring and analyzing fairness guarantees at both group and individual levels in stochastic MAB settings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in this paper:

The paper proposes an algorithm called Bi-Level Fair UCB (BF-UCB) that simultaneously provides anytime group exposure fairness guarantees and ensures meritocratic fairness within groups in stochastic multi-armed bandits.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new notion of "bi-level fairness" (\ourfair) in stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB). This notion considers fairness at two levels - group fairness to ensure minimum exposure for each group of arms, and meritocratic fairness within each group to ensure fair allocation to individual arms based on merit.

2. It proposes a UCB-based algorithm called \ouralgo that achieves bi-level fairness. The algorithm provides anytime group fairness guarantees while learning a meritocratic fair policy within each group. 

3. It shows theoretically that the regret of \ouralgo can be decomposed into two parts - regret due to group fairness and regret due to meritocratic fairness. Using this decomposition, it proves that \ouralgo achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$.

4. It validates the algorithm empirically by comparisons on different performance metrics like regret, group exposure fairness, and within-group fairness. The experiments show that \ouralgo achieves sub-linear regret, ensures much better group and individual arm exposures compared to baselines, without significant loss in cumulative reward.

In summary, it introduces a new notion of fairness in MABs considering both group and individual fairness, proposes an algorithm to achieve it, provides theoretical regret analyses, and validates the approach empirically.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multi-armed bandits (MAB): The general stochastic framework for sequential decision making under uncertainty where there are multiple "arms" (actions/options) with unknown rewards.

- Group fairness: Ensuring fair exposure/selection of groups of arms representing different groups in real-world contexts (e.g. based on protected attributes like gender or race).

- Meritocratic fairness: Ensuring arms/options within a group are selected according to their merit or quality.  

- Bi-level fairness: The proposed combined notion that incorporates both group fairness and meritocratic fairness within groups.

- Group exposure fairness (GEF): The specific notion of guaranteeing minimum exposure to each group of arms.

- Meritocratic fairness (MF): The specific notion defined formally based on a merit function that determines exposure in proportion to merit within groups.  

- Regret decomposition: Splitting the overall regret into two components based on group selection regret and within group policy regret.

- BF-UCB algorithm: The proposed "Bi-level Fairness UCB" bandit algorithm that adapts UCB to achieve bi-level fairness.

Some other potentially relevant terms are anytime guarantees, upper confidence bounds, confidence regions, and fairness regret. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel notion of "bi-level fairness" in stochastic multi-armed bandits. What are the two levels of fairness guarantee and how do they complement each other? Explain with an example scenario.

2. Explain the key differences between the existing notions of fairness in stochastic MABs like meritocratic fairness, calibrated fairness etc. and the proposed bi-level fairness. What new issues does bi-level fairness attempt to address?

3. The regret analysis shows that the overall regret can be decomposed into two components. Explain these two components of regret and the key challenges involved in bounding them individually.  

4. The paper adapts the UCB based algorithm for achieving bi-level fairness. Explain the specific modifications done in the group selection strategy and the arm selection strategy within a group over vanilla UCB.

5. How does the paper tackle the challenge of providing meritocratic fairness guarantees within a group without knowing apriori the number of times a group will be selected? Explain.

6. The proof of sub-linear regret relies on several supporting lemmas like bounding probability that estimated mean lies outside confidence intervals using Hoeffding's inequality. Explain the high level proof idea.

7. Compare and contrast the notions of fairness and corresponding algorithms proposed in this paper with two other closest works in fair stochastic MAB domain.

8. The choice of merit function is important in defining as well as operationalizing meritocratic fairness. Discuss the merits and demerits of using the identity merit function over other options.

9. Critically analyze the regret decomposition approach - does it lead to loose bounds compared to directly bounding the overall regret? Are there any alternative approaches?

10. The paper considers a fixed pairwise grouping of arms into majority vs minority groups. How can the algorithm and analysis be extended for more complex partitioning of arms into multiple groups?
