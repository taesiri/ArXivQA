# [Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to evaluate large language model (LLM) based chat assistants for their alignment with human preferences, beyond just core capabilities measured by existing benchmarks. The key hypotheses are:1) Strong LLMs like GPT-4 can be used as judges to effectively evaluate other chatbot models on open-ended questions and match human preferences.2) The proposed evaluation approach using LLM judges is more scalable and automated compared to traditional human evaluation. 3) The new human preference benchmarks (MT-bench and Chatbot Arena) complement existing standardized benchmarks by capturing different aspects of model quality.The authors systematically examine the efficacy of using LLMs as judges by comparing their evaluations to human ratings. They introduce two new benchmarks tailored to assess human preference and model alignment. The paper investigates the agreement between LLM judges and humans, and argues LLM-based evaluation could become a promising standard practice.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A systematic study of using large language models (LLMs) as judges to evaluate chatbot responses, referred to as "LLM-as-a-judge". The authors examine the potential biases and limitations of this approach and propose solutions to mitigate some of them.2. The introduction of two new benchmarks for evaluating chatbots based on human preferences rather than just correctness: - MT-bench: A set of 80 high-quality multi-turn questions to test conversational and instruction following abilities.- Chatbot Arena: A crowdsourced platform for users to engage in conversations with anonymous chatbots and rate their responses. 3. Verifying the agreement between LLM judges like GPT-4 and human preferences on the new benchmarks. The results show GPT-4 can match both controlled expert evaluations and crowdsourced preferences with over 80% agreement, same as the level of agreement among humans. This suggests LLM-as-a-judge is a promising alternative to expensive human evaluations.4. Demonstrating the value of combining existing capability-focused benchmarks with new human preference benchmarks for comprehensively evaluating LLMs. 5. Releasing the MT-bench dataset, 3K expert votes, and 30K crowdsourced conversations from Chatbot Arena for further research.In summary, the key innovation is using strong LLMs as scalable and interpretable proxies for human evaluations of chatbots based on open-ended conversations and instructions, rather than just closed-ended tasks. The paper provides a rigorous analysis of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes using advanced language models like GPT-4 as judges to evaluate chatbots, instead of relying solely on slow and expensive human evaluations. The key claims are that GPT-4 judges can match human preferences with over 80% agreement, making this a promising scalable and automated way to assess chatbot quality.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions the authors suggest:- Benchmarking chatbots at scale with a broader set of categories. The paper focuses on 8 categories in MT-bench, but suggests expanding to more domains. - Developing an open-source LLM judge aligned with human preferences. The paper shows GPT-4 works well, but a freely available model would be more accessible.- Enhancing open models' math and reasoning capabilities. The paper shows limitations of models like Vicuna-13B on math/reasoning questions. Improving performance on those categories is an area for future work.- Addressing limitations and biases of the LLM-as-a-judge approach through more advanced methods. The paper proposes some preliminary solutions but more work can be done.- Studying the different dimensions within the notion of "helpfulness", like accuracy, relevance, creativity etc. The current work uses a single overall metric of preference.- Analyzing the origin and mitigation of position bias in more depth. The paper shows position bias exists but does not fully study where it comes from.- Conducting controlled studies on potential self-enhancement bias. The paper currently only examines this statistically on a small sample.- Developing more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that combine capability benchmarks and human preference benchmarks.- Continued dataset collection and release to enable better research on human preferences and model behaviors.In summary, the key suggestions are developing more diverse human preference benchmarks, improving LLM judges, studying biases and limitations more thoroughly, and combining existing standardized benchmarks with new human-centered ones.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper explores using strong large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 as judges to evaluate other LLM-based chat assistants, an approach they term "LLM-as-a-judge." To study this, they introduce two new benchmarks with human ratings: MT-bench, a set of multi-turn open-ended questions, and Chatbot Arena, a platform for crowdsourced battles between chatbots. They examine potential limitations of LLM-as-a-judge like position and verbosity biases and limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. Their results show that GPT-4 can match both controlled expert votes on MT-bench and crowdsourced votes on Chatbot Arena with over 80% agreement, the same level as agreement among humans. This suggests LLM-as-a-judge could be a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences for evaluating chatbots, compared to expensive traditional human evaluation. They argue this method complements existing capability-focused benchmarks, and propose a hybrid evaluation framework combining both for a comprehensive assessment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces two new benchmarks, MT-bench and Chatbot Arena, for evaluating the capabilities of large language model (LLM) based chat assistants. MT-bench consists of 80 high-quality multi-turn questions designed to test conversation and instruction following abilities across diverse categories. Chatbot Arena is a crowdsourcing platform where users engage with anonymous chatbot models and provide ratings. The paper argues that existing benchmarks focus on closed-ended tasks and fall short in assessing alignment with human preferences. To enable scalable evaluation, the paper explores using strong LLMs like GPT-4 as judges to automatically assess chatbot responses. Several potential limitations of this LLM-as-a-judge approach are examined, including position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limited reasoning ability. Solutions are proposed to address some of these, like swapping position to mitigate position bias. The agreement between LLM judges and human ratings is evaluated on the two new benchmarks. Results show GPT-4 judge can match human preferences with over 80% agreement, on par with agreement among humans, establishing feasibility of using LLM judge to approximate human evalution.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a summary of the main method used in the paper in one paragraph: The paper explores using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 as automatic judges to evaluate the responses of chatbot assistants on open-ended questions. To evaluate this LLM-as-a-judge approach, the authors introduce two new benchmarks - MT-bench, a set of 80 high-quality multi-turn questions, and Chatbot Arena, a platform for crowdsourced battles between anonymous chatbots. The LLMs are prompted to judge which of two chatbot responses is better through pairwise comparison. The agreement between LLM judgements and human judgements is then analyzed. The results show that GPT-4 can match human preferences with over 80% agreement, achieving comparable performance to agreement amongst humans. This suggests that LLM-as-a-judge could be a scalable and interpretable way to approximate human preferences for evaluating chatbots, as collecting human judgements is very slow and expensive. Some biases like position bias are analyzed and methods are proposed to address limitations. Overall, using strong LLMs as automatic judges on thoughtfully constructed benchmarks is shown to be a promising approach for chatbot evaluation aligned with human preferences.
