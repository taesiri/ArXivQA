# [Attack Deterministic Conditional Image Generative Models for Diverse and   Controllable Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing conditional image generative models like GANs typically produce fixed outputs for the same input. This lacks diversity, which is unreasonable for highly subjective tasks like image inpainting or style transfer. Existing methods to induce diversity require retraining models, designing complex functions, or struggle with quality. 

Solution:
The paper proposes achieving diversity by attacking pre-trained deterministic models via adversarial examples. Two methods are presented: 1) Untargeted attack to maximize difference from default output. 2) Targeted attack using CLIP to match target text/image. This enables diversity without any model adjustment.

Key Ideas:
- Adversarial attack can encourage diversity in deterministic conditional image generators 
- Untargeted attack maximizes statistical loss between default and attacked results
- Targeted attack aligns attacked results with target text/image in CLIP space
- Works by adding imperceptible input noise found via gradient descent 

Contributions:
- First work to apply adversarial attack for conditional image generation
- Simple plug-in method to achieve diversity from pre-trained deterministic models
- Qualitative and quantitative demonstration of effectiveness over baselines
- Provides new perspective on interpretability of vision models via adversarial examples

Overall, the paper presents a novel way to achieve diverse and controllable image generation by attacking fixed conditional models, without needing to modify model architectures or retrain them. Key results and comparisons validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using adversarial attacks to induce diversity and controllability in deterministic conditional image generation models without modifying their parameters or architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing adversarial attack into conditional image generation and demonstrating the potential of deterministic generative models to produce diverse results. 

2) Proposing a novel non-learning method that enables diverse generation of a deterministic generative model without any adjustment of network structure or fine-tuning. The method is plug-in and can be easily applied.

3) Conducting extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method can guide deterministic/diverse generative models to generate diverse and controllable results thanks to being sensitive to initial perturbation and less prone to overfitting the constraint.

4) Providing a new perspective for the interpretability research of low-level vision tasks and vision-language representation models by analyzing model behaviors when attacked.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an efficient adversarial attack based method to induce diversity and controllability in existing deterministic conditional image generative models, without needing to modify model architectures or retrain the models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Conditional image generation: The paper focuses on conditional generative models for image generation tasks like inpainting, style transfer, super-resolution etc.

- Deterministic models: The paper discusses deterministic conditional image generative models that produce a fixed output for a given input. 

- Diversity: One of the main goals is to induce diversity in the outputs of deterministic models without changing their parameters or structure.

- Adversarial attack: The core idea is to use adversarial attack methods like FGSM and PGD to make small perturbations to the input and generate diverse outputs. 

- Untargeted attack: Adding perturbations to maximize difference from the default output to achieve diversity.

- Targeted attack: Using CLIP model to guide the attack direction and generate outputs matching given text/image. 

- Controllability: Controlling the diverse outputs by specifying attack directions based on reference texts or images.

- Interpretability: The method provides a way to understand what image generative models have learned by analyzing their behavior on adversarial inputs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using adversarial attack to introduce diversity into conditional image generation models. Can you explain in more detail the intuition behind why adding small perturbations to the input can lead to more diverse outputs? 

2. The paper uses simple statistical losses like L1 loss and variance loss for the untargeted attack. Did you experiment with any other more complex losses? If so, how did they perform compared to the simple losses?

3. For the targeted attack, you align the perturbation direction with the difference in CLIP embeddings between the source and target descriptions. What happens if you use other alignment methods besides the dot product?

4. You mentioned the attack may lead to artifacts if using PGD-style truncation. Can you elaborate on what kind of artifacts you observed and why the noise truncation method helped alleviate them?  

5. You evaluated your method on both ill-posed and well-posed tasks. Did you notice any differences in how easy it was to generate diversity for these two types of tasks? What implications does this have?

6. You show the method works on BigGAN to make it generate unrecognizable samples. Do you have any insight into which layers or operations in BigGAN are causing this non-robustness? 

7. You discuss the misalignment between CLIP and human perception spaces. Do you have any ideas on how to better constrain the attack to prevent overfitting text guidance?

8. Did you experiment with ensembles of models rather than single models? Does attacking an ensemble lead to more diversity compared to a single model?

9. For real-world deployment, how would you determine appropriate ranges for epsilon and truncation thresholds? Is there a principled way to set these or is it mostly trial-and-error?

10. The method relies on backpropagation through the generator network. For very deep networks, do you have any suggestions to improve efficiency? Are there opportunities to approximate gradients rather than compute exact gradients?
