# [Attack Deterministic Conditional Image Generative Models for Diverse and   Controllable Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing conditional image generative models like GANs typically produce fixed outputs for the same input. This lacks diversity, which is unreasonable for highly subjective tasks like image inpainting or style transfer. Existing methods to induce diversity require retraining models, designing complex functions, or struggle with quality. 

Solution:
The paper proposes achieving diversity by attacking pre-trained deterministic models via adversarial examples. Two methods are presented: 1) Untargeted attack to maximize difference from default output. 2) Targeted attack using CLIP to match target text/image. This enables diversity without any model adjustment.

Key Ideas:
- Adversarial attack can encourage diversity in deterministic conditional image generators 
- Untargeted attack maximizes statistical loss between default and attacked results
- Targeted attack aligns attacked results with target text/image in CLIP space
- Works by adding imperceptible input noise found via gradient descent 

Contributions:
- First work to apply adversarial attack for conditional image generation
- Simple plug-in method to achieve diversity from pre-trained deterministic models
- Qualitative and quantitative demonstration of effectiveness over baselines
- Provides new perspective on interpretability of vision models via adversarial examples

Overall, the paper presents a novel way to achieve diverse and controllable image generation by attacking fixed conditional models, without needing to modify model architectures or retrain them. Key results and comparisons validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
