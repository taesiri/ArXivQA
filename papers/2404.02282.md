# [Smooth Deep Saliency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computing gradient-based saliency maps in hidden layers of CNNs that use convolutional downsampling introduces checkerboard noise which dominates and makes the saliency maps difficult to interpret. 
- This noise comes from the fact that with stride 2 convolutions, not every input pixel gets multiplied with every weight.
- Existing saliency methods typically operate on the input layer or final convolutional layer only.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate three methods to reduce checkerboard noise in hidden layer saliency maps:
  1) Bilinear Surrogate: Replace each strided convolution with a bilinear downsampling and two 3x3 convolutions trained to match the original.
  2) Backward Hook: Modify backprop to average gradients spatially. 
  3) Forward Hook: Modify forward pass to average activations spatially.
- Evaluate noise reduction using total variation (TV) of saliency maps.
- Assess faithfulness to original model using accuracy and prediction difference.

Contributions:
- Showed the bilinear surrogate model closely matches accuracy of original while reducing TV of saliency maps from hidden layers by an average of 21.6% (DeepLift) and 31.5% (Gradient).
- Demonstrated the backward hook also reduces noise without needing extra training data.
- Presented case studies highlighting usefulness of less noisy saliency maps from hidden layers to identify relevant input structures.
- Discovered tradeoff between faithfulness and noise reduction, with bilinear surrogate offering a good balance.

Overall, the paper introduces and evaluates methods to create smoother, more interpretable saliency maps from hidden layers of CNNs by reducing checkerboard noise. This helps explain which input structures deep models utilize for prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates methods to reduce checkerboard noise in saliency maps computed from hidden layers of convolutional neural networks, in order to make them smoother and more interpretable for explaining model predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing and evaluating methods to reduce the checkerboard noise in saliency maps computed from hidden layers of deep neural networks that use convolutional downsampling. Specifically, the authors propose and compare three methods:

1) Training a bilinear surrogate model to replace the convolutional downsampling layers. This is shown to closely match the accuracy of the original model while reducing noise.

2) Using backward hooks to change how the gradients are calculated in the backward pass of convolutional layers. This reduces noise without needing to train a separate model.

3) Using forward hooks to spatially roll the input before convolution to reduce checkerboard artifacts by default. However, this impacts model accuracy more than the other methods.

The authors evaluate these methods on image classification models trained on ImageNet and tumor detection models trained on medical imaging data. They quantitatively show reductions in noise measured by total variation and also include case studies visualizing smoother and more interpretable saliency maps compared to the original models. The overall contribution is advancing methods to compute and visualize better saliency map explanations from hidden layers of convolutional neural networks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes three different methods to reduce checkerboard noise in saliency maps - bilinear surrogate, backward hook, and forward hook. Can you explain in detail how each of these methods works to reduce the noise? What are the key differences between them?

2. The bilinear surrogate method requires training a surrogate model on the training data. What is the rationale behind training this surrogate model? Why is it designed with bilinear downsampling and two convolutional layers on either side? How is it trained?

3. The paper evaluates the methods on accuracy, prediction difference, and total variation (TV) of the saliency maps. Can you explain what each of these evaluation metrics captures and why they were chosen? How do the three proposed methods perform on these metrics?

4. The paper computes saliency maps using DeepLift and simple gradients. What is the difference between these two methods? Why does the paper use two different attribution methods?

5. The backward and forward hook methods directly modify the model's forward or backward pass respectively. How do these modifications help reduce checkerboard noise and what are the tradeoffs? 

6. The paper observes that the forward hook method, while most effective at reducing TV, suffers from much lower accuracy. Why does modifying the forward pass degrade accuracy so much? Is there a way this method can be improved?

7. The paper applies the methods on ImageNet, Camelyon16 and an in-house digital pathology dataset. What are some key differences between these datasets that demonstrate the broad applicability of the methods?

8. The saliency maps are computed towards different layers of the model - input, hidden, and output layers. What is the rationale behind computing maps at hidden layers? What do the saliency maps at different layers capture?

9. One limitation mentioned is that the methods assume hidden layer activations are localized to input space. When can this assumption break down? How can the localization be quantified/validated?

10. The paper hypothesizes that explanations from the bilinear surrogate model could explain the original model. What experiments could be done to rigorously validate this hypothesis? What metrics could be used?
