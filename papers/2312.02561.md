# [DanZero+: Dominating the GuanDan Game through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02561)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an AI system called DanZero+ for the complex Chinese card game GuanDan using reinforcement learning. GuanDan poses significant challenges for AI due to its huge state and action spaces, long episode lengths, changing player dynamics, and intricate rules. The authors first develop an AI agent called DanZero using Deep Monte Carlo (DMC) methods and distributed self-play training. DMC allows effective function approximation without overestimating and handles the large action space well. DanZero outperforms baseline rule-based agents, demonstrating strong performance. To further improve performance, the authors augment DanZero with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To mitigate PPO's challenges with large action spaces, they use DanZero to provide a small set of top action candidates that PPO selects from. This DanZero+ agent combines the strengths of both algorithms and defeats DanZero. Evaluations against human players and ablation studies demonstrate DanZero+'s superior skills. The method of using a pre-trained model to constrain action spaces could be extended to other large imperfect information games. Overall, DanZero+ represents state-of-the-art AI performance on the complex game of GuanDan.
