# [DanZero+: Dominating the GuanDan Game through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02561)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an AI system called DanZero+ for the complex Chinese card game GuanDan using reinforcement learning. GuanDan poses significant challenges for AI due to its huge state and action spaces, long episode lengths, changing player dynamics, and intricate rules. The authors first develop an AI agent called DanZero using Deep Monte Carlo (DMC) methods and distributed self-play training. DMC allows effective function approximation without overestimating and handles the large action space well. DanZero outperforms baseline rule-based agents, demonstrating strong performance. To further improve performance, the authors augment DanZero with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To mitigate PPO's challenges with large action spaces, they use DanZero to provide a small set of top action candidates that PPO selects from. This DanZero+ agent combines the strengths of both algorithms and defeats DanZero. Evaluations against human players and ablation studies demonstrate DanZero+'s superior skills. The method of using a pre-trained model to constrain action spaces could be extended to other large imperfect information games. Overall, DanZero+ represents state-of-the-art AI performance on the complex game of GuanDan.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage approach using Deep Monte Carlo (DMC) followed by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to develop an AI system for the complex card game GuanDan. Why was this two-stage approach preferred over using just DMC or just PPO? What are the limitations of using each method independently?  

2. The DMC method is used as the foundation and the pre-trained DMC model provides candidate actions for the PPO model. Discuss the rationale behind using DMC first rather than PPO. What unique advantages does the DMC method offer in handling the challenges of the GuanDan game environment?

3. The paper mentions that replacing PPO with other policy gradient methods does not affect the complexity. Elaborate on why this statement holds true. Discuss the computational challenges faced by policy-based methods in GuanDan and how the two-stage approach addresses this.

4. The number of candidate actions from the DMC model given to PPO is practically set at 2 in experiments. Analyze the impact of this hyperparameter on model performance, sample efficiency and computational efficiency. Discuss the tradeoffs.  

5. The method filters top-K actions using a DMC model before applying PPO. Critically analyze whether simply using a rules-based method to filter actions would offer the same advantages. Justify your response.

6. The paper demonstrates cases where the PPO model chooses different actions than the top choice suggested by the DMC model. Speculate on what additional reasoning and environment understanding must be learned by PPO to make such decisions.

7. The method adopts heuristic rules to handle the complex tribute phase in GuanDan, with samples from this stage not used for model updates. Propose alternative techniques to train an end-to-end model that can handle both the card play and tribute phases. 

8. Discuss potential shortcomings of using self-play as the primary training methodology for GuanDan versus training against a wider diversity of policies. How can the limitations of self-play be addressed?

9. The performance improvement from using PPO versus just DMC is modest in some test cases. Suggest methods to further boost the performance gains from adding the PPO stage. 

10. The method has only been evaluated on GuanDan. Analyze its transferability to other complex multiplayer imperfect information games like Mahjong or Poker. What adaptations would be required for application to these other environments?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of developing an AI system for the card game GuanDan. GuanDan is a highly complex imperfect information game with features like a large state and action space, long episode length, changing player dynamics within an episode, and a variable number of legal actions. These complexities make it difficult to directly apply standard reinforcement learning algorithms like deep Q-learning or policy gradient methods. Prior attempts using classical techniques like UCT have failed to achieve strong performance.

Method:
The paper proposes using Deep Monte Carlo (DMC) as the core learning algorithm. DMC allows handling large state/action spaces, utilizes action features, and avoids overestimation bias. To address other challenges of GuanDan:

- Meticulously designed 513-dim state features and 54-dim action features to capture relevant information
- Distributed training framework for efficient parallel self-play 
- Special rules to handle the complex "tribute" phase

This results in an agent called DanZero that defeats state-of-the-art rule-based bots.

To further improve performance, the paper enhances DanZero with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Naively applying PPO faces difficulties due to the large action space. So they use the pre-trained DanZero model to provide the top-k candidate actions to PPO. This allows PPO to learn effectively. The resulting agent DanZero+ defeats DanZero and is the new state-of-the-art for GuanDan AI.

Main Contributions:

- First well-performing AI system for the complex card game GuanDan using DMC & distributed self-play
- Method to apply PPO in games with huge action spaces by restricting candidates from a pre-trained model 
- Extensive experiments showing DanZero/DanZero+ significantly outperforming rule-based bots and DanZero+ outperforming DanZero

The paper provides a strong benchmark for GuanDan AI and showcases techniques like leveraging pre-trained models that could be applied to other complex games with large action spaces.
