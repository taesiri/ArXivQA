# [DanZero+: Dominating the GuanDan Game through Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02561)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of developing an AI system for the card game GuanDan. GuanDan is a highly complex imperfect information game with features like a large state and action space, long episode length, changing player dynamics within an episode, and a variable number of legal actions. These complexities make it difficult to directly apply standard reinforcement learning algorithms like deep Q-learning or policy gradient methods. Prior attempts using classical techniques like UCT have failed to achieve strong performance.

Method:
The paper proposes using Deep Monte Carlo (DMC) as the core learning algorithm. DMC allows handling large state/action spaces, utilizes action features, and avoids overestimation bias. To address other challenges of GuanDan:

- Meticulously designed 513-dim state features and 54-dim action features to capture relevant information
- Distributed training framework for efficient parallel self-play 
- Special rules to handle the complex "tribute" phase

This results in an agent called DanZero that defeats state-of-the-art rule-based bots.

To further improve performance, the paper enhances DanZero with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Naively applying PPO faces difficulties due to the large action space. So they use the pre-trained DanZero model to provide the top-k candidate actions to PPO. This allows PPO to learn effectively. The resulting agent DanZero+ defeats DanZero and is the new state-of-the-art for GuanDan AI.

Main Contributions:

- First well-performing AI system for the complex card game GuanDan using DMC & distributed self-play
- Method to apply PPO in games with huge action spaces by restricting candidates from a pre-trained model 
- Extensive experiments showing DanZero/DanZero+ significantly outperforming rule-based bots and DanZero+ outperforming DanZero

The paper provides a strong benchmark for GuanDan AI and showcases techniques like leveraging pre-trained models that could be applied to other complex games with large action spaces.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Deep Monte Carlo (DMC) as the foundation and then enhancing performance with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Why was DMC chosen over other reinforcement learning algorithms as the basis? What are some key advantages of DMC for this problem?

2. The distributed training framework uses separate actor and learner processes. What are the benefits of this actor-critic approach compared to a monolithic training process? How does it improve sample efficiency?  

3. The paper encodes the state using a 513-dimensional vector. What kind of information is captured in each part of this state representation? Why is such a high-dimensional state encoding necessary?

4. The action space in GuanDan can be very large, posing challenges for policy gradient methods like PPO. How does the paper address this issue? Explain the idea of using the DMC model to constrain the action space and why this helps facilitate PPO.

5. Hyperparameter tuning plays an important role when applying PPO in this method. What are some of the key hyperparameters that need careful adjustment? How was the tuning process conducted?

6. The tribute phase uses separate heuristic rules rather than learning. Why was it difficult to train a model to handle both the tribute and card-playing phases? What are some example rules used in the tribute phase?

7. The paper shows cases where PPO chooses different actions than those suggested by DMC. Analyze these cases - what superior understanding do you think PPO has developed to make those decisions?

8. Could this method of combining DMC and PPO be applied to other large imperfect information games? What characteristics make it suitable for transfer learning? How might it need to be adapted?

9. The method trains using self-play. What are the benefits of self-play over training against fixed rule-based opponents? How does it directionally lead the training?

10. What ideas do you have to further improve the performance of this GuanDan AI system? What other algorithms could be integrated or changes made to the method?
