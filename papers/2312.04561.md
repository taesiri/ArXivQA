# [GenDeF: Learning Generative Deformation Field for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04561)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a novel video generation paradigm called Generative Deformation Field (GenDeF), which explicitly disentangles a video into a canonical image containing content information and a deformation field containing motion information. Specifically, the canonical image branch encodes the spatial content shared across the video, while the deformation field branch captures temporal dynamics by predicting per-frame deformation fields that warp pixels from the canonical image to form video frames. This decomposition brings three main advantages: 1) Reusing a pre-trained image generator for the canonical image alleviates the difficulty of video generation and improves visual quality; 2) The structured deformation field allows applying explicit regularizations like smoothness over time to improve consistency; 3) The disentanglement enables propagating edits made to the canonical image throughout the video for applications like video editing. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Ablations validate the importance of canonical-conditioned deformation field generation and structural regularization. Qualitative results showcase potential downstream applications enabled by this decomposition. Limitations like fixed-resolution representation and requirement of explicit decomposition are discussed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel video generation method called GenDeF, which explicitly decomposes a video into a canonical image containing the content information and a deformation field containing the motion information to facilitate video generation and downstream applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel video generation paradigm called Generative Deformation Field (\method). The key ideas are:

1) It explicitly decomposes a video into a content-related canonical image that is shared by all frames, and a motion-related deformation field that is frame-wise. 

2) The video can be obtained by warping the canonical image using the deformation field. This decomposition brings several benefits:

(a) It reduces the difficulty of learning content and motion simultaneously, leading to better video quality. 

(b) The explicit deformation field allows applying structural regularizations to improve temporal consistency. 

(c) It facilitates downstream applications like consistent video editing, point tracking, video segmentation by propagating operations on the canonical image.

3) Experiments show superior performance over previous methods on commonly used video generation benchmarks. Both the quality of individual frames and the temporal consistency are improved.

In summary, the main contribution lies in the proposed explicit video decomposition paradigm and deformation field based video generation pipeline, which eases video generation learning, allows explicit regularization, and enables downstream propagation.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Video generation aims to sample new videos from noise distributions. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality and temporally consistent videos. Existing methods decompose videos into content and motion latent variables, but the decomposition is implicit and only in low-dimensional space, limiting model interpretability and downstream applications.

Method:
This paper proposes a novel video generation paradigm called Generative Deformation Field (GenDeF). It explicitly decomposes a video into a canonical image containing content information and a deformation field containing motion information in high-dimensional pixel space. Specifically:

- A canonical image generator is used to produce a content-related static image shared by all video frames. This image is pre-trained on individual frames to capture content efficiently.  

- A deformation field generator outputs a per-frame deformation field that warps pixels from the canonical image to the output frame. It takes as input the canonical image feature to align the motion with content.

- The video frame is rendered by warping the canonical image using the deformation field. An edge-aware smoothness loss on estimated optical flows is applied for better temporal consistency.

Main Contributions:

- The explicit decomposition of content and motion in pixel space reduces video generation difficulty, leading to better quality, especially on single frames.

- The structured deformation field allows explicit temporal smoothness regularization on motion and facilitates downstream applications like consistent video editing, point tracking, video segmentation by operating on the canonical image.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on common datasets. Unique applications like sampling multiple motions for the same content and video processing via canonical image editing are demonstrated.

To summarize, this paper proposes a novel and superior video generation paradigm based on generative deformation fields that decomposes videos into structured content and motion representations. This explicit disentanglement brings better quality and enables various applications.
