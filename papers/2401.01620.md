# [Large Language Model Capabilities in Perioperative Risk Prediction and   Prognostication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01620)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates whether general-domain large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can be used for perioperative risk prediction and prognostication. Specifically, the authors examine if LLMs can take as input a description of a surgical procedure along with a patient's clinical notes from their electronic health record, and output predictions related to post-operative outcomes like length of hospital stay, ICU admission, complications, etc. Accurate risk stratification can help clinicians make better decisions about whether to proceed with a surgery.

Approach 
The authors curated a dataset of over 90,000 surgical cases from 3 hospitals, along with associated clinical notes and post-operative outcomes. They defined 8 prediction tasks related to outcomes like ASA physical status classification, hospital admission, ICU admission, lengths of stay, etc. For each task, they created a balanced dataset of 1000 test cases and 250 few-shot examples. They evaluated the LLM GPT-4's performance on these tasks using different prompting strategies like zero-shot, few-shot learning, and chain-of-thought reasoning prompts.

Key Findings
- GPT-4 shows strong predictive performance for ICU admission (F1 score 0.81) and hospital mortality (F1 score 0.86). Performance was more modest for tasks like ASA classification (F1 0.50) and hospital admission (F1 0.64).
- Few-shot learning and chain-of-thought prompting improve performance on some but not all tasks. Gains were seen for classification tasks rather than regression tasks involving predicting lengths of stay.
- GPT-4 struggled with numerical prediction, exhibiting quantization behavior and ceiling effects. The authors hypothesize architectural limitations related to representing continuous values.

Overall, the paper demonstrates promising capabilities of general-domain LLMs for perioperative risk stratification without any clinical fine-tuning. But there are still significant limitations around predicting numerical outcomes. The authors suggest future work on clinical LLMs and multimodal representations may help address these.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates whether general-domain large language models can accurately predict various perioperative risk outcomes for patients undergoing surgery using only the preoperative clinical notes and procedure information, finding that models exhibit capability on some classification outcomes but struggle with regression tasks involving duration predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can perform perioperative risk prediction and prognostication tasks using only a description of the procedure and the patient's clinical notes, without any domain-specific fine-tuning. The main contributions are:

1) Benchmarking the capabilities of general-domain LLMs on 8 different perioperative prediction tasks related to risk stratification, including predicting outcomes like ICU admission, mortality, and lengths of stay.

2) Evaluating the effect of different prompting strategies like in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning on improving predictive performance across these tasks. 

3) Analyzing model performance on classification vs regression tasks, using note summaries vs full notes, and on note length stratifications.

4) Demonstrating that current LLMs can assist with perioperative risk stratification by producing high-quality natural language rationales and explanations even if their quantitative predictions are not on par with dedicated models. The authors conclude that LLMs have utility for summarizing patient histories and creating explanations to support clinician workflows.

In summary, this paper focuses on benchmarking LLM capabilities on a set of perioperative prediction tasks using real clinical notes, with analysis on how different prompts affect performance. The utility of LLMs in providing qualitative decision support for clinicians via summaries and explanations is a key highlight.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores using GPT-4 Turbo for perioperative risk prediction tasks. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of using a general domain large language model like GPT-4 compared to a clinical domain-specific model for these tasks?

2. The authors test the model on 8 different perioperative prediction tasks. What considerations went into selecting these particular tasks and what insights can be gained about the model's capabilities from evaluating performance across this range of tasks?

3. The authors utilize a variety of prompting strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. Why is it valuable to test multiple prompting formulations and what are the tradeoffs associated with more complex prompting approaches?  

4. When generating the datasets for the perioperative tasks, inverse frequency sampling is used to address class imbalance. Explain this technique and why it is an appropriate choice for constructing the datasets.

5. The model exhibits very strong predictive performance on ICU admission and hospital mortality but struggles with numerical prediction tasks like length of stay. Propose some architectural enhancements to large language models that could improve numerical reasoning capability.  

6. Prompt engineering plays a major role in steering model performance on downstream tasks. Discuss some of the prompt design choices made in this work and how variations may further optimize predictive accuracy.

7. The model generates natural language rationales explaining its predictions. Compare and contrast the utility of these rationales versus typical machine learning model explanation techniques.

8. The model is only provided with text inputs of clinical notes and procedure data. How might incorporating other data modalities like images, time series, or ontological knowledge improve predictive capacity?

9. Error analysis revealed the model makes predictions that are clinically sensible even when incorrect. Why does this matter when evaluating readiness for real-world clinical implementation?

10. The model exhibits variable predictive gains from few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting depending on the task. Propose hypotheses that could explain this observation and how it could guide optimal prompt formulation.
