# [Learning Expressive And Generalizable Motion Features For Face Forgery   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing face forgery detection methods mainly focus on appearance features which can be easily attacked by sophisticated manipulation. Current sequence-based methods directly use general video classification networks which discard special motion information for forgery detection.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an effective sequence-based forgery detection framework by modifying an existing video classification method (STM) to make the motion features more expressive and generalizable:

1. A Motion Consistency Block (MCB) is proposed instead of the Channel-wise Motion Module in STM to explicitly capture motion consistency information using a second-order differential architecture. This leverages the lack of coordination between frames in fake faces. 

2. An Anomaly Detection (AD) auxiliary block is added that forces the feature distribution of real faces to be compact while not constraining fake faces. This regularizes feature learning.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a Motion Consistency Block to effectively model the motion consistency information for discriminative forgery detection.

- Designed an Anomaly Detection block with a combining loss to make the learned spatio-temporal features more generalizable to unseen distortions and forgery methods.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FaceForensics++, DeeperForensics, and Celeb-DF datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the improvements to the video classification backbone.

- Provides in-depth analysis on the contribution of individual components through extensive ablation studies.

The proposed modifications to leverage motion consistency and anomaly detection make the video classification backbone more suitable for face forgery detection across datasets.
