# [MATK: The Meme Analytical Tool Kit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06094)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the Meme Analytical Tool Kit (MATK), an open-source repository designed to support meme classification tasks. As memes have become an influential form of online communication, analyzing their complex ideas and impact has attracted interest. However, models and datasets for meme analysis are scattered across repositories, hampering research progress. MATK aims to address this by serving as a centralized resource that organizes datasets and multimodal models for classifying memes across domains like hate speech, misogyny, emotions, etc. Built on design principles like modularity, flexibility, and reproducibility, MATK currently supports 7 models and 8 meme datasets. It leverages the PyTorch Lightning framework to simplify training and incorporates analysis techniques like LIME and Integrated Gradients for model interpretation. MATK has reproduced performances of models like PromptHate and FLAVA, and showcased LIME analysis on FLAVA. Future plans include expanding dataset/model support and enabling multi-task learning across datasets. Overall, MATK focuses on user-friendliness to assist practitioners and researchers in efficiently training and analyzing state-of-the-art multimodal models for diverse meme classification tasks.
