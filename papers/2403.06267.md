# [FARPLS: A Feature-Augmented Robot Trajectory Preference Labeling System   to Assist Human Labelers' Preference Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06267)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Preference-based learning aims to align robot task objectives with human values, often done via pairwise comparisons of trajectories. However, traditional comparison-based preference labeling systems do not sufficiently support labelers in identifying critical differences between complex robot trajectories shown in videos.  
- A formative study with 12 participants revealed that individuals may overlook non-salient features, establish biased criteria, experience mental fatigue, and lose focus when labeling many trajectory pairs, causing deteriorating label quality.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose FARPLS, a Feature-Augmented Robot trajectory Preference Labeling System to address these challenges. 
- FARPLS highlights potential outliers in various task features and extracts corresponding keyframes for easy review. It clusters trajectories by features and dynamically adjusts prompting order based on user familiarity, difficulty, and disagreements. 
- The system provides real-time attention monitoring, progress feedback, and consistency checking to improve user engagement.

Main Contributions:
- Conducted a formative study to understand human labelers' trajectory comparison process and derived a list of criteria and features that matter.
- Designed and implemented an interactive labeling system FARPLS with capabilities to assist comparison, maintain engagement, etc.
- Evaluated FARPLS in a user study (N=42) and showed it helped users establish criteria, notice details, improved consistency and engagement without increasing cognitive load.
- Discussed implications for preference elicitation system design, especially supporting sensemaking, mitigating biases, and designing prompting mechanisms.

In summary, the paper presents a novel labeling system tailored for robot trajectory preference elicitation to improve data quality and user experience. Comprehensive studies offer insights into human-centered issues in value alignment.
