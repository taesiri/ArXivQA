# [Subjective $\textit{Isms}$? On the Danger of Conflating Hate and Offence   in Abusive Language Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02268)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent NLP research has started embracing annotator subjectivity in tasks like hate speech detection, understanding disagreements in labeling as valid individual perspectives. 
- However, this risks affording equal validity to all positions on concepts like racism or sexism, rather than recognizing them as culturally defined harms.
- There is a concerning conflation between the concepts of hate speech and offensiveness in datasets and models, treating them as the same phenomenon when they are actually orthogonal.

Proposed Solution:
- Argue hate speech and offense are separate - offense is subjective individual outrage, hate speech relies on cultural stereotypes and biases. 
- Understand hate speech as culturally defined, stable given socio-cultural contexts, while offense is individual and variable.
- Annotating tasks should clearly distinguish hate speech from offense, using separate labels and guidelines.
- Annotators should be selected carefully with relevant backgrounds to identify hate speech based on lived experience.

Main Contributions:
- Explain how stereotypes and biases constitute culturally defined hate speech, not individual subjective perspectives.
- Elucidate the difference between subjective offense and culturally situated hate speech.
- Call for NLP research in this area to avoid conflating offense and hate speech in data and models. 
- Provide recommendations for improving annotation guidelines and recruitement to better capture hate while understanding offense.

The key insight is that by construing concepts like racism or sexism as subjective in NLP research, we fail to recognize them as cultural harms, and risk affording validity to discriminatory positions. Carefully delineating hate speech from offense can lead to better datasets and models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper argues that conflating the concepts of hate speech and offensive speech in abusive language detection delegitimizes findings, and calls for clearly distinguishing between hate as culturally-defined and offense as subjective in order to validate research on phenomena like racism and sexism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is arguing that hate speech and offense are orthogonal concepts that should not be conflated. Specifically:

- The paper argues that hate speech (isms like racism, sexism, etc) is culturally defined, while offense is a subjective individual experience. They should not be treated as the same thing.

- Conflating hate speech and offense can invalidate research findings and methods in hate speech detection. Offense depends on the subjective view of the reader, while hate speech exists independently as a cultural construct.

- The authors call for future annotation schemes and guidelines to carefully distinguish between hate speech and offense as separate concepts/categories. They also recommend recruiting annotators with relevant lived experiences to label hate speech data.  

- The paper proposes understanding hate speech as cultural formations of societal norms, not subjective experiences. This allows hate speech to be separated from individual offense.

In summary, the key contribution is clearly delineating hate speech and offense as distinct concepts that should not be conflated, and providing recommendations to achieve this in annotation and modeling of hate speech. The goal is to develop better methods for identifying actual hate speech.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Isms - Referring to prejudices, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics like race, gender, sexuality, etc. (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.).

- Hate speech - Attacks or pejorative/discriminatory language targeting a person or group based on their identity. 

- Offensiveness - Subjective moral outrage or disgust felt by an individual.  

- Subjectivity - Differing individual perspectives shaped by factors like culture and experience.

- Relativism - Idea that criteria of judgment are relative to a culture or society.

- Stereotypes - Shared overgeneralized beliefs about groups used to represent perceived differences between groups. Argued to be socially/culturally formed rather than individual.

- Benevolent isms - Positive stereotypes that can still cause harm by setting expectations. 

- Scientific isms - Use of pseudo-scientific evolutionary biology to justify stereotypes as natural differences.

- Conflation of hate speech and offensiveness - Authors argue these are distinct, orthogonal concepts that should not be equated or labeled the same.

- Recommendations - Guidelines and annotator recruitment should clearly distinguish isms and offensiveness. Recruit annotators with relevant backgrounds.

The key focus is on critically examining the relationship between concepts like hate speech, offensiveness, stereotypes, and subjectivity in the context of abusive language detection. The authors argue that isms are socially constructed and should not be equated with individual offensiveness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors argue that hate speech detection should not be seen as a subjective task. What evidence do they provide to support this argument? How does this contrast with some recent perspectives in NLP?

2. The paper distinguishes between the concepts of "hate speech" and "offense". What are the key differences between these concepts according to the authors? Why is conflating them problematic? 

3. The authors argue that stereotypes and prejudices ("isms") are socially and culturally defined, not purely subjective. What evidence from philosophy and gender studies do they cite to support this? How might this impact annotation guidelines?

4. What role does the authors' proposed concept of the "Overton window" play in understanding changing social acceptability of different forms of hate speech over time? How might this impact annotation? 

5. What are some examples provided of "benevolent" stereotyping? Why might these still be considered problematic even if not overtly negative? What are the implications for annotation?

6. The paper critiques the use of "scientific" explanations and evolutionary psychology to justify stereotypes and hate speech. Can you summarize this argument and its connections to concepts like Social Darwinism?

7. How do the authors distinguish between subjective "offense" and broader cultural definitions of hate speech? What are the implications of this distinction for dataset construction and modeling? 

8. The authors argue annotator standpoints and lived experience plays a key role. How might this connect to Standpoint Theory? What recommendations follow in terms of recruiting annotators?

9. Can you summarize how the authors propose reframing hate speech detection based on understanding stereotypes and hate speech as cultural artifacts? What inspiration do they draw from anthropology?

10. The authors provide recommendations for task construction and annotation schema design. Can you summarize their key suggestions in this regard? What challenges do they recognize still exist around implementing prescriptivist schemas?
