# [Efficient Knowledge Deletion from Trained Models through Layer-wise   Partial Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07611)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing machine unlearning techniques face several practical challenges, including performance degradation after unlearning, demand for brief fine-tuning, and significant storage requirements. Specifically, approximate unlearning methods like amnesiac unlearning cause noticeable drops in model performance on retained data. Retraining-based methods like SISA require substantial computational resources. 

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces two novel classes of efficient approximate machine unlearning algorithms to address these limitations:

1. Partial Amnesiac Unlearning: Integrates layer-wise pruning into conventional amnesiac unlearning. During training, it prunes a portion of the model updates from each layer and stores them. During unlearning, it subtracts only the pruned updates made by batches containing the target data. This minimizes negative impact on retained data while erasing target data. Also reduces storage needs.

2. Layer-wise Partial Updates: Incorporates layer-wise partial updates into label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning methods. Updates only a fraction of parameters in each layer, prioritizing layers appropriately. Mitigates adverse effects on retained data representations while erasing target data.  

Main Contributions:

- Proposed partial amnesiac unlearning eliminates need for fine-tuning after unlearning, unlike conventional amnesiac unlearning, while reducing storage needs. Showed superior performance.

- Demonstrated layer-wise partial updates in label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning mitigates negative impact on retained classes unlike their naive versions.

- Extensive evaluations over diverse datasets and neural network architectures to demonstrate effectiveness of proposed methods compared to counterparts.

The key insight is strategically updating only a fraction of parameters during unlearning protects retained data representations while erasing target data knowledge. The proposed techniques offer efficient approximate machine unlearning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces novel machine unlearning methods that integrate layer-wise pruning and partial updates to efficiently erase the impact of targeted data from trained models while preserving performance on retained data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel "partial amnesiac unlearning" method that integrates layer-wise pruning with amnesiac unlearning to efficiently erase the targeted data from an already trained model. This method requires less storage space and preserves model performance on retained data without needing additional fine-tuning.

2. Suggesting the integration of layer-wise partial-updates into label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning methods to strategically mitigate their potential negative impact on model efficacy. This aims to maintain effectiveness on retained data while erasing target data influence. 

3. Conducting comprehensive empirical assessments across diverse datasets like MNIST and MEDMNIST using various neural network architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unlearning methods. The results showcase their ability to effectively erase target data influence while preserving superior performance on retained data compared to conventional counterparts.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new class of efficient and effective machine unlearning algorithms that can selectively erase target data influence from trained models without significantly compromising performance on retained data.

The paper introduces two main proposed unlearning methods:

1) Partial amnesiac unlearning: This integrates layer-wise pruning with amnesiac unlearning to efficiently erase the targeted data from an already trained model. It subtracts pruned updates made during training to minimize the loss of knowledge from retained data.

2) Layer-wise partial-updates: This is integrated into label-flipping and optimization-based unlearning methods to mitigate their adverse effects on the representations of retained classes. By slowing down the updates to retained classes, it better preserves their learned representations.

The key focus areas are approximate unlearning techniques that aim to modify an already trained model to forget specific target data, while preserving performance on retained non-target data. Concepts like layer-wise pruning and updates are leveraged to achieve this.
