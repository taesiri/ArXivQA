# [Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Split Learning Framework for Smart Grid   Load Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01438)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate electricity load forecasting is important for demand-supply balancing, infrastructure planning, etc. 
- Sensor-based approaches using smart meter data and ML models are common. However, transferring data from multiple smart meters to a central server for training raises privacy, security and communication overhead issues.
- Decentralized methods like federated learning and split learning can help but have limitations for this application.

Proposed Solution:
- A split learning framework where the model is split between the Grid Station (GS) serving each neighbourhood and the Service Provider (SP). 
- Clients only do a forward pass through the GS part of the model using their data. GS does the remaining computations, reducing client workload.  
- Two strategies: SplitGlobal (single global SP model) and SplitPersonal (personalized SP model per GS).
- Use a modified transformer architecture called FEDformer which has better performance than LSTM/RNN.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a dual split learning strategy that significantly reduces smart meter workload while enabling neighborhood-level personalized models.
- First work to apply transformers via split learning for electricity load forecasting. Performs better than or on par with centralized model.
- Detailed analysis of privacy leakage using mutual information estimation, with and without differential privacy. Finds minimal leakage through split model.
- Shows model can handle differential privacy noise with only minor performance impact.
- Evaluation across multiple scenarios like across-neighborhood prediction, unseen data, etc.

In summary, it proposes a practical split learning framework for electricity load forecasting that balances accuracy, privacy and communication costs through neighborhood-based personalized modeling and transformers.
