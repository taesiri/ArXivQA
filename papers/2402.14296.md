# [Mitigating Biases of Large Language Models in Stance Detection with   Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14296)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT achieve good performance on many NLP tasks but have biases on the stance detection task. Specifically, LLMs exhibit two main types of biases:
  1) Sentiment-stance spurious correlations: Sentiment expressed in the text misleads the judgment of stance towards a target. 
  2) Target preference biases: Biased stance judgments for certain targets/individuals/topics.
- Existing debiasing methods have limitations when applied to LLMs as they require retraining or modifying the input in ways that disrupt the LLM's reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution:  
- A new framework called MB-Cal (Mitigating Biases of LLMs in stance detection with Calibration) with two main components:
  1) Gated calibration network: Controls the contribution of causal vs non-causal reasoning from the LLM to make an unbiased stance prediction.
  2) Counterfactual data augmentation: Constructs additional training samples to enhance the calibration network's ability to rectify stance biases.

Main Contributions:
- First work to analyze and categorize biases of LLMs in stance detection. Proposes metrics to quantify the biases.
- MB-Cal framework to mitigate LLM biases on stance detection without needing to retrain the LLM.
- Experiments show MB-Cal reduces LLM biases on stance detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-target and zero-shot stance detection benchmarks.

In summary, this paper identifies and analyzes the biases of LLMs in stance detection, and proposes a practical calibration framework to mitigate those biases and improve stance detection performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel framework called MB-Cal to mitigate biases of large language models in stance detection by using a gated calibration network and counterfactual data augmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

1) It is the first to investigate the biases of large language models (LLMs) on stance detection, categorizing the biases into two main types from the perspective of causality and proposing metrics to quantify these two types of biases. 

2) It proposes MB-Cal, a novel framework consisting of a gated calibration network and counterfactual data augmentation to mitigate biases of LLMs on stance detection.

3) A series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed MB-Cal can effectively reduce the bias of LLMs in stance detection, improving the performance in both in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a method called MB-Cal to mitigate biases in LLMs for stance detection and showing its effectiveness empirically. The analysis of biases in LLMs for this task and the categorization into two types is also viewed as a contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Stance detection - The task of automatically identifying an author's opinionated standpoint towards a target.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Powerful neural network models like GPT-3 that are trained on large amounts of text data and can generate impressively fluent text. 

- Biases - Systematic errors in stance judgement made by LLMs, categorized into sentiment-stance spurious correlations and target preference biases. 

- Mitigation - Methods proposed to alleviate the impact of biases, including a gated calibration network and counterfactual data augmentation. 

- In-target stance detection - Evaluating stance detection when the targets are seen during training.

- Zero-shot stance detection - Evaluating stance detection on unseen targets not encountered during training.

- Generalizability - The ability of a stance detection method to perform well on new, unseen targets.

- Causality - Analyzing the causal relationships between text, target, features and label to identify biases.

- Counterfactual reasoning - Generating altered examples that invert key causal features to improve model understanding.

In summary, the key focus is on analyzing, quantifying and mitigating biases in LLMs for stance detection to improve performance, especially generalizability to new targets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two types of biases that LLMs exhibit in stance detection - sentiment-stance spurious correlations and target preference biases. Can you elaborate on why these two types of biases arise in LLMs when doing stance detection? 

2. The paper uses causal graphs to analyze the biases of LLMs in stance detection. Can you explain the components in the causal graph and how the two types of biases manifest as biased reasoning paths in the graph?

3. The core of the proposed method is a gated calibration network. Can you explain in detail how this network functions to reduce the impact of non-causal reasoning and output unbiased stances? 

4. Counterfactual augmented data is used to enhance the gated calibration network. What are the two strategies used to construct the counterfactual data and how does this data help improve the performance and generalizability of the model?

5. The paper demonstrates superior performance over strong baselines in both in-target and zero-shot experimental setups. Can you analyze the results and explain why the proposed method works well in both scenarios?

6. An ablation study is conducted by removing components of the proposed method. What is the impact observed when removing the calibration network and the two types of counterfactual data respectively?

7. The paper uses instructions to elicit causal and non-causal reasoning from the LLMs. Can you suggest some alternative methods to obtain such reasoning? What are the tradeoffs?

8. The counterfactual data in this method is generated using GPT-3.5-turbo. What could be some limitations of relying on another LLM and how can it be addressed? 

9. The method is evaluated on 3 datasets - SemEval 2016 Task 6, P-stance and VAST. What are some key differences between these datasets that test different aspects of the method's effectiveness?

10. The paper focuses on mitigating biases for stance detection. Can you suggest some other NLP tasks where such an approach would be meaningful and what adaptations would be required?
