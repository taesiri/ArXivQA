# [System Identification of Neural Systems: Going Beyond Images to   Modelling Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of large-scale studies comparing video understanding models to biological neural systems to understand how the brain processes dynamic information and actions. 
- Previous works focused more on single image models and did not consider dynamics modeling.  
- An important open question is whether system identification between models and brain responses is feasible.

Methodology:
- Propose system identification study in simulated (models as target) and real (brain as target) environments.
- Use regularized regression method to map model layers to brain regions without assuming one-to-one mapping.
- Compare 30+ convolutional and transformer-based video models, including single-stream, two-stream, supervised and self-supervised.

Key Findings:
- System identification between image and video models is feasible to a certain extent. 
- Video models predict brain responses better than image models, confirming importance of dynamics.
- Convolutional models predict early-mid brain regions better, while multiscale transformers are still decent.
- Two-stream models outperform single-stream counterparts.
- Fully supervised models outperform self-supervised models.

Main Contributions:  
- First large-scale study of video understanding models from a neuroscience perspective
- Demonstrate feasibility of system identification between models and brain dynamics
- Provide insights on how different model families compare to brain regions
- Show importance of dynamics modeling when comparing models to brains

The key highlight is the focus on studying video and dynamics modelling in models to better understand biological brains, which has been lacking in prior works. The findings confirm video models align better with brain dynamics processing.
