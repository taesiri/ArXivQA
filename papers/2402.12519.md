# [System Identification of Neural Systems: Going Beyond Images to   Modelling Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12519)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of large-scale studies comparing video understanding models to biological neural systems to understand how the brain processes dynamic information and actions. 
- Previous works focused more on single image models and did not consider dynamics modeling.  
- An important open question is whether system identification between models and brain responses is feasible.

Methodology:
- Propose system identification study in simulated (models as target) and real (brain as target) environments.
- Use regularized regression method to map model layers to brain regions without assuming one-to-one mapping.
- Compare 30+ convolutional and transformer-based video models, including single-stream, two-stream, supervised and self-supervised.

Key Findings:
- System identification between image and video models is feasible to a certain extent. 
- Video models predict brain responses better than image models, confirming importance of dynamics.
- Convolutional models predict early-mid brain regions better, while multiscale transformers are still decent.
- Two-stream models outperform single-stream counterparts.
- Fully supervised models outperform self-supervised models.

Main Contributions:  
- First large-scale study of video understanding models from a neuroscience perspective
- Demonstrate feasibility of system identification between models and brain dynamics
- Provide insights on how different model families compare to brain regions
- Show importance of dynamics modeling when comparing models to brains

The key highlight is the focus on studying video and dynamics modelling in models to better understand biological brains, which has been lacking in prior works. The findings confirm video models align better with brain dynamics processing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a large-scale study comparing over 30 state-of-the-art deep video understanding models to recordings of the human visual cortex, demonstrating the feasibility of system identification between image and video models and providing insights into how biological neural systems encode dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It conducts a system identification study that goes beyond single images to videos, establishing both a simulated environment setup using video understanding models as the target and a real environment setup with the target model as the human visual cortex. 

2. It showcases the first large-scale study of deep video understanding models including convolutional vs transformer-based, single vs two stream and fully vs self-supervised models. Over 30 models are studied.

3. It improves the encoding model in system identification by accounting for the hierarchical nature and complex cross-scale interactions of deep networks through a previously proposed weighted neural encoding scheme.

In summary, the paper focuses on studying video understanding models from a neuroscience perspective through system identification and neural encoding experiments. It provides new insights by conducting the first large-scale comparison of state-of-the-art deep video understanding models to recordings of the human visual cortex.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- System identification - studying whether deep networks can identify the underlying modeling scheme (e.g. image vs video understanding) when compared to biological neural systems

- Video understanding models - models designed specifically for video, including convolutional and transformer architectures, that model dynamics and motion

- Biological neural systems - referring to the visual cortex regions in the human brain that encode visual information 

- Neural encoding - mapping visual stimuli to neural activations in the brain using deep regression 

- Model families - categorizing models based on input (image vs video), supervision (fully supervised vs self-supervised), and architecture (convolutional vs transformer)

- Visual cortex regions - specific regions studied including early (V1-V4), mid (LOC, EBA) and high-level (FFA, STS, PPA) that encode different types of visual information

- Simulated experiments - using deep networks as target models to identify modeling scheme

- Real experiments - using human visual cortex as target model 

- Large-scale comparison - studying over 30 state-of-the-art video understanding models

- Fine-grained analysis - detailed comparison within model families to study aspects like single vs two-stream architectures

The key goal is studying if system identification is possible and providing insights on how video understanding in deep networks compares to the visual cortex.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a layer-weighted region of interest encoding technique. Can you explain in more detail how this encoding scheme works and how it is different from simpler regression techniques? What are the benefits it provides?

2. The paper conducts experiments in both a simulated environment and a real environment. What is the motivation behind having these two setups? How do the experiments and results differ across the two environments?

3. When conducting experiments in the simulated environment, the paper uses MViT-B, ViT-B, and I3D ResNet-50 as target models. What is the rationale behind selecting these specific models as targets? How do the results vary across the different target models?

4. The paper argues that previous large-scale studies comparing deep networks to biological neural systems have missed a crucial aspect - modelling dynamics. Can you expand more on what is meant by modelling dynamics and why it is an important consideration in this context?

5. When analyzing the results in the real environment, the paper finds that video understanding models perform better than image understanding models. What implications does this finding have on efforts to interpret deep networks and encode biological neural systems?

6. The fine-grained analysis shows that two-stream architectures surpass single-stream counterparts. What is a two-stream architecture and what advantages does it offer for modelling biological dynamics? 

7. The paper finds that convolutional models better predict early-mid visual cortex regions compared to transformer models. What explanations are provided in the paper for this result? How could this inform transformer model design?

8. When comparing self-supervised and fully supervised models, the paper sees worse performance from self-supervised models. Why might this be the case? What are some ways the self-supervised models could be improved?

9. In the layer contribution analysis, the paper demonstrates alignment between early/mid layers in models and early/mid visual cortex regions. Is this finding surprising? How does it relate to the hierarchical nature of biological and artificial neural networks?

10. Beyond the specific analyses conducted in the paper, what other model comparisons would be informative to study in relation to dynamics modelling and the visual cortex?
