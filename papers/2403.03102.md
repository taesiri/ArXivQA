# ["In Dialogues We Learn": Towards Personalized Dialogue Without   Pre-defined Profiles through In-Dialogue Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03102)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "In Dialogues We Learn": Towards Personalized Dialogue Without Pre-defined Profiles through In-Dialogue Learning":

Problem: 
- Personalized dialogue systems typically rely on pre-defined persona profiles to generate responses that reflect a specific personality. However, creating accurate profiles is time-consuming and doesn't allow flexibility. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes In-Dialogue Learning (IDL), a framework to learn persona information directly from dialogues without needing manually created profiles. 

- IDL has two stages:
   1) Mutual Supervised Learning (MSL): Uses static and dynamic persona identification to select relevant dialogues and optimize model to incorporate persona information
   2) Deep Personalized Alignment (DPA): Further optimizes model using proposed DPOC method to align responses more precisely to learned persona

Main Contributions:

- First framework to create personalized dialogue system from dialogues without pre-defined profiles, enabling direct learning of persona from history

- Introduces static and dynamic persona identification in MSL stage to effectively select relevant dialogues for learning persona 

- Presents DPOC in DPA stage, a novel reinforcement learning approach to address preference degradation and align responses closer to target persona

- Experiments on multiple datasets show IDL achieves comparable performance to very strong profile-based methods and significantly outperforms other profile-free personalized dialogue methods

- Demonstrates the ability of IDL to effectively leverage large language models for personalized dialogue without needing manually created profiles
