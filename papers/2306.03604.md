# [Enabling Intelligent Interactions between an Agent and an LLM: A   Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03604)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can an agent interact with a large language model (LLM) in an intelligent and cost-effective way to solve complex embodied tasks?

More specifically, the paper explores using reinforcement learning to train a mediator model that can determine when it is necessary for the agent to query the LLM for high-level instructions. The goal is to enable the agent to solve target tasks with only minimal necessary interactions with the LLM, thereby reducing the interaction costs associated with using a large external LLM.

The key hypothesis seems to be that by learning an explicit asking policy through RL, the agent can learn when it should ask the LLM for new plans versus adhering to its current plan. This allows the agent to balance task performance and interaction costs.

So in summary, the central research question is around enabling efficient and intelligent agent-LLM interactions, and the hypothesis is that an RL-trained asking policy can achieve this goal. The experiments then aim to evaluate this hypothesis across different embodied environments like MiniGrid and Habitat.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an RL-based approach called "When2Ask" to enable efficient and cost-effective interactions between an embodied agent and a large language model (LLM). Specifically:

- They introduce a mediator module within the Planner-Actor-Mediator framework that decides when it is necessary for the agent to query the LLM for high-level instructions. This mediator contains an asking policy trained with RL to balance task performance and interaction costs.

- They evaluate When2Ask in MiniGrid and Habitat environments requiring planning sub-goals. Results show it achieves high task success with only a few necessary interactions with the LLM, significantly reducing costs compared to baselines.

- Experiments suggest the learned mediator makes the agent's performance more robust against partial observability by enabling it to handle newly acquired information and unexpected errors when providing subsequent plans. 

- They open source their code to facilitate research on leveraging LLMs for embodied agents.

In summary, the key contribution is using RL to learn an intelligent asking policy that mediates interactions between the agent and LLM. This enables effective and cost-efficient utilization of the LLM's reasoning abilities for complex embodied tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in using large language models (LLMs) to assist embodied agents:

- It builds on prior work that explores using LLMs as planners/reasoners for embodied agents, such as Ahn et al. 2022, Wang et al. 2023, and Dasgupta et al. 2023. However, it focuses specifically on designing an intelligent mediator to facilitate efficient interaction between the agent and LLM.

- Compared to methods that use hard-coded rules for querying the LLM (e.g. Ahn et al. 2022), this paper proposes learning an adaptive asking policy using RL. This allows more flexible and intelligent interaction compared to hand-designed rules.

- Unlike Dasgupta et al. 2023 which queries the LLM at every timestep, this work aims to minimize unnecessary LLM interactions to improve efficiency. The learned asking policy determines when interaction is needed.

- The approach is evaluated extensively in both simple grid worlds (MiniGrid) and more visually realistic environments (Habitat). Results demonstrate the learned policy enables efficient task completion across environments.

- The proposed mediator model makes the overall system more robust to uncertainties and flaws in other components like the translator. This is a useful property lacking in some prior work.

Overall, this paper makes a nice contribution in designing the mediator to enable more intelligent and efficient interaction with LLMs. The RL-learned asking policy is a key innovation compared to prior work. The comprehensive experiments highlight the strengths of the approach in terms of minimizing LLM queries while maintaining good task performance. The code release also makes this a useful contribution for researchers in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential directions for future work:

- Developing a fully learned mediator that serves as an optimal interface between LLMs and actors. This could involve training a translator specifically designed to provide the most accurate and informative text descriptions for LLMs. 

- Exploring how to leverage other capabilities of LLMs beyond reasoning, such as memorization, summarization, and few-shot learning. For example, investigating how LLMs can summarize an agent's past experiences to aid long-term credit assignment in RL.

- Extending the approach to non-embodied environments, such as using LLMs for commonsense reasoning in fine-grained visual learning tasks.

- Studying how to incorporate other attractive features of LLMs, as recent research has showcased their capabilities beyond reasoning, such as memorization, summarization, and few-shot learning.

- Exploring how LLMs can summarize an agent's past experiences to contribute to solving the long-term credit assignment problem in RL.

Overall, the main future directions focus on further optimizing the interface between agents and LLMs, leveraging additional capabilities of LLMs beyond reasoning, and extending the approach to other types of environments and tasks beyond embodied RL settings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an approach called When2Ask that enables efficient and cost-effective interactions between an embodied agent and a large language model (LLM) deployed on a remote server. The approach uses a reinforcement learning-based mediator within a Planner-Actor-Mediator framework to determine when it is necessary for the agent to query the LLM for high-level instructions. Experiments conducted in MiniGrid and Habitat environments demonstrate that When2Ask learns to solve tasks with only a few necessary interactions with the LLM, significantly reducing costs compared to methods that interact more frequently. The learned policy also makes the agent's performance more robust to partial observability in the environment. Overall, When2Ask provides an intelligent way for agents to leverage the reasoning abilities of LLMs as external planners while minimizing communication overhead and costs. The approach could enable more practical real-world applications of LLMs for assisting embodied agents.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called When2Ask that enables efficient and cost-effective interactions between an embodied agent and a large language model (LLM) planner in complex environments. The approach utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL) based mediator within a Planner-Actor-Mediator framework to determine when it is necessary for the agent to query the LLM planner for high-level instructions. 

The key idea is to train an explicit asking policy using RL that decides at each timestep whether the agent should request a new plan from the LLM planner or continue executing its current plan. This allows minimizing unnecessary queries to the LLM while still obtaining plans when critical new information is observed. Experiments conducted in MiniGrid and Habitat environments demonstrate the approach enables competitive task performance with significantly fewer LLM interactions compared to baselines. The learned asking policy also makes the agent's performance more robust to uncertainties and partial observability in the environment. Overall, the approach provides an intelligent and cost-effective means of leveraging LLMs' reasoning and world knowledge for embodied agents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an approach called When2Ask to enable intelligent and cost-effective interactions between an embodied agent and a large language model (LLM) planner. The method is based on a Planner-Actor-Mediator framework, where the planner is an LLM, the actor executes actions, and the mediator determines when to query the LLM planner. The key contribution is using reinforcement learning to train an explicit asking policy in the mediator to decide when to request new plans from the LLM planner. The asking policy takes as input the current observation and previous option, and outputs whether to ask the LLM or continue the current plan. It is trained using PPO to maximize task rewards while minimizing unnecessary queries to the LLM. Experiments in MiniGrid and Habitat environments demonstrate the approach enables the agent to complete tasks successfully with significantly fewer interactions with the LLM compared to baselines. The learned asking policy also makes the agent's performance more robust to uncertainties in other components like the translator. Overall, the approach provides an effective way to leverage LLM reasoning while minimizing interaction costs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of enabling efficient and cost-effective interactions between an embodied agent and a large language model (LLM) in sequential decision making tasks. Specifically, it focuses on the problem of determining when it is optimal for the agent to query the LLM for assistance versus relying on its own skills and knowledge.

Some key questions the paper is aiming to address:

- How can an agent learn when it should interact with an LLM planner versus continue executing a previous plan? Frequent unnecessary interactions are costly, while insufficient queries may prevent the agent from adapting its plan when needed.

- Can a reinforcement learning approach be used to train an "asking policy" that decides intelligently when to query the LLM? 

- How does learning a mediator model to facilitate agent-LLM interactions impact performance in partially observable environments where the agent must react to newly acquired information?

- Can an RL-trained asking policy make the overall system more robust to uncertainties or flaws in other components like the observer/translator?

- What are the tradeoffs between task performance and interaction costs when using different interaction strategies like always asking, never asking, random, or learned asking policies?

In summary, the central focus is on developing an intelligent mediator to optimize the interaction timings and enable cost-effective collaboration between an embodied agent and an LLM assistant. The key goals are minimizing unnecessary LLM queries while still leveraging the LLM's knowledge when critical to task success.
