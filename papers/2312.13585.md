# [Speech Translation with Large Language Models: An Industrial Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13585)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Speech translation typically involves a complex pipeline including speech segmentation, transcription via automatic speech recognition (ASR), text processing, translation, and alignment of translations to timestamps. This lengthy pipeline presents bottlenecks and inefficiencies. The paper aims to address this with an end-to-end speech translation model (LLM-ST) that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform all these tasks in a unified model.

Proposed Solution: 
- LLM-ST is based on a pretrained LLM (13 billion parameters), which provides strong text understanding capabilities, combined with a speech encoder to handle audio inputs. 
- Multi-task instruction tuning is used to train the model on various speech, text and translation tasks like ASR, machine translation, speech translation, transliteration between speech, pronunciation and text, and timestamp prediction. This provides diverse modalities of guidance.
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is introduced by decomposing speech translation into intermediate steps - first transcribing speech and then translating text for example. This was found to boost performance.
- In-context training with preceding text appended to instructions is also utilized.

Main Contributions:
- Proposing LLM-ST that can process long speech and generate synchronized timestamped transcriptions and translations in a single end-to-end model.
- Demonstrating strong performance of LLM-ST across English<=>Chinese translation tasks, outperforming cascaded systems and end-to-end baselines.
- Applying CoT prompting and showing benefits over direct speech translation prompting.
- Providing analysis on how audio and context aid translation disambiguation.
- Highlighting feasibility of deploying an end-to-end industrial speech translation system.
