## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Calculating electron density distribution using density functional theory (DFT) is critical for studying quantum properties of materials and molecules, but accurate and efficient calculation remains challenging due to the high computational cost. Machine learning models have been developed to predict electron density, but they rely on custom basis functions and have shown limited expressivity and applicability. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces ChargE3Net, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network that directly predicts electron density at any arbitrary point in an atomic system. It achieves equivariance through higher-order tensor representations of atoms and probe points.

Key Contributions:

- ChargE3Net outperforms prior state-of-the-art equivariant models on predicting density for diverse sets of materials and molecules, without relying on additional quantum mechanical features. This shows its ability to learn complex atomic interactions in a data-driven manner.

- When trained on over 120K DFT calculations from Materials Project, ChargE3Net demonstrates expressivity across the periodic table and various material classes. This suggests it can reproduce a broad range of chemical interactions.

- Analysis shows higher-order representations yield more accurate predictions for materials with high angular variation in density. This is attributed to better capturing directional covalent bonding.

- Predicted densities reduce the self-consistent DFT steps required for convergence by 27% on average. Non-self-consistent calculations using predicted densities also recover key properties like forces, band energies and gaps at near DFT accuracy for most materials.

- ChargE3Net scales linearly with system size and can predict density for systems with >10,000 atoms, surpassing DFT feasibility. This shows promise for using it as a foundation model refined with DFT.

In summary, this work shows uniquely combining graph networks, SO(3) equivariance and higher-order representations enables highly accurate, generalizable and scalable prediction of electron density across diverse atomic systems.
