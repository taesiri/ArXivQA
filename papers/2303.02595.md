# [PyramidFlow: High-Resolution Defect Contrastive Localization using   Pyramid Normalizing Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02595)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we develop an unsupervised defect localization method that achieves high resolution results without relying on external datasets or pre-trained models?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

By developing a fully normalizing flow model based on a latent template contrastive paradigm and multi-scale pyramid architecture, it may be possible to achieve state-of-the-art defect localization performance without external priors.

In summary, the paper is proposing and evaluating a new unsupervised defect localization approach called PyramidFlow that aims to overcome limitations of existing methods that rely on reconstruction, pre-trained features, or external datasets. The goal is to develop a high resolution localization method that works from scratch in an end-to-end manner.
