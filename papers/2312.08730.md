# [Towards Robust and Expressive Whole-body Human Pose and Shape Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08730)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework called RoboSMPLX to enhance the robustness and reliability of whole-body human pose and shape estimation. The authors identify three key limitations of existing methods: poor localization ability, inability to extract useful features under variations, and lack of output alignment. To address these, RoboSMPLX incorporates three novel modules - a Localization Module to explicitly learn the location and semantics of body parts, a Contrastive Feature Extraction Module to extract consistent features using pose-aware contrastive learning, and a Pixel Alignment Module to ensure precise alignment using differentiable rendering. Comprehensive experiments on body, hand, face and whole-body benchmarks demonstrate RoboSMPLX's effectiveness. The ablation studies validate the advantage of each proposed module. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning is shown to be more suitable than self-supervised counterparts for this task. The use of regressed 3D joints as representation and color/location-variant augmentations are identified as optimal configurations. Overall, the sophisticated design of RoboSMPLX leads to state-of-the-art or competitive performance on various benchmarks while enhancing robustness. The runtime analysis also demonstrates its efficiency.
