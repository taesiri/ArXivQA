# [LLMs as Factual Reasoners: Insights from Existing Benchmarks and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14540)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How capable are large language models (LLMs) at detecting factual inconsistencies in text summaries, and what are the limitations of existing benchmarks for evaluating this capability?The key points related to this question are:- The authors evaluate a range of LLMs on existing factual consistency benchmarks like FactCC, AggreFact, and DialSummEval. Initial results suggest some LLMs are competitive with non-LLM methods. - However, further analysis reveals issues with relying solely on classification accuracy. Many LLMs struggle to provide valid explanations for their predictions, indicating they may be right for the wrong reasons.- Analysis of the AggreFact benchmark reveals a significant number of mislabeled samples, limiting precise evaluation. - To address limitations of existing benchmarks, the authors propose a new protocol for creating factual consistency benchmarks focused on reproducibility and cost-effectiveness. - They implement this protocol in a new benchmark called SummEdits spanning 10 domains. Experiments show most LLMs still struggle on this benchmark compared to estimated human performance.So in summary, the key research question is assessing and improving evaluation of LLM capabilities for the complex reasoning needed to detect factual inconsistencies in summaries. The authors identify issues with current benchmarks and propose a new methodology to create better benchmarks for this task.
