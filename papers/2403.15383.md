# [ThemeStation: Generating Theme-Aware 3D Assets from Few Exemplars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15383)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ThemeStation: Generating Theme-Aware 3D Assets from Few Exemplars":

Problem:
- Generating a large gallery of 3D assets that share a consistent theme (e.g. buildings in an ancient town) is challenging and time-consuming. 
- Existing methods for text/image-to-3D generation suffer from 3D ambiguity and inconsistency due to limited 3D information.
- Methods for 3D-to-3D generation based on 3D exemplars only produce resized/repeated assets without semantic variations.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage generative framework called "ThemeStation" for theme-aware 3D-to-3D generation:
  1. Generate diverse concept images that share theme of input 3D exemplars by fine-tuning an image diffusion model.
  2. Convert concept images to 3D models using a reference-informed 3D modeling process with a novel "dual score distillation (DSD)" loss.
- The DSD loss applies two diffusion priors:
  1. Concept prior from concept image to guide global layout and color.
  2. Reference prior from input 3D exemplars to recover finer details.
- These two priors are applied at different noise levels during optimization to reduce loss conflicts.

Main Contributions:
- First work on extending diffusion priors for theme-aware 3D-to-3D generation. 
- A two-stage framework to generate thematic yet diverse 3D assets from few exemplars.
- A novel DSD loss that disentangles and applies concept prior and reference prior based on noise levels.
- Experiments and user study demonstrate high quality and diversity of generated 3D assets.

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the main ideas behind the proposed ThemeStation framework and dual score distillation loss, as well as the major contributions made in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
