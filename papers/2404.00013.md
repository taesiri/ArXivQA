# [Missing Data Imputation With Granular Semantics and AI-driven Pipeline   for Bankruptcy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on developing a pipeline for bankruptcy prediction of companies. Bankruptcy prediction is challenging due to three main issues in financial datasets - missing values, high dimensionality, and class imbalance between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies. These issues make it difficult to apply machine learning models effectively for bankruptcy prediction.

Proposed Solution:
A two-stage solution is proposed - 

1. A new missing data imputation technique using "granular semantics" is introduced. Here, granules (small groups of observations) are formed around each missing data point using the most correlated features. Missing values are then estimated within these granules using a regression model rather than the full dataset to reduce complexity.

2. An AI pipeline is designed for bankruptcy prediction consisting of:
(i) Missing value imputation using the proposed granular semantic technique
(ii) Feature selection using Random Forests 
(iii) Handling class imbalance using SMOTE 
(iv) Prediction using classifiers like logistic regression, neural networks etc.

Main Contributions:

1. A computationally efficient method for missing value imputation using context-aware granules, that uses only a small, relevant part of the dataset. Comparative studies show this outperforms techniques like MICE, Hot Deck imputation etc.

2. Designing an end-to-end pipeline for bankruptcy prediction that handles all key data challenges - missing values, high dimensionality and class imbalance. 

3. Experimental validation using Polish bankruptcy dataset over 5 years shows accuracy >90% and AUC around 0.8-0.9 with the pipeline, proving its effectiveness for bankruptcy prediction using various classifiers.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing a granular semantic approach for missing value imputation and an AI pipeline for addressing real-world data challenges in bankruptcy prediction. The high prediction accuracy demonstrates its practical utility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new method for missing data imputation using granular semantics. This method forms contextual granules around missing values by selecting relevant features and reliable observations. It then performs prediction within these granules, avoiding the need to access the full large dataset repeatedly.

2. It designs an AI-driven pipeline for bankruptcy prediction that addresses key challenges like missing data, high dimensionality, and class imbalance. The pipeline includes the proposed granular semantics based data imputation, feature selection using random forest, class balancing using SMOTE, and bankruptcy classification using various ML models.

3. The proposed data imputation method is shown to provide higher or comparable accuracy to methods like MICE, FHDI and autoencoders, while also being robust to high missing data rates.

4. The complete pipeline is validated on Polish bankruptcy datasets across 5 years, achieving over 90% accuracy and AUC around 0.8-0.9 with classifiers like logistic regression, DNNs etc.

In summary, the key contribution is a computationally efficient and accurate data imputation technique and an effective bankruptcy prediction pipeline that handles real-world data challenges. The pipeline and techniques are rigorously validated on benchmark datasets.
