# [FFT-based Selection and Optimization of Statistics for Robust   Recognition of Severely Corrupted Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Improving the robustness of image classification models against common corruptions is challenging. Existing methods have limitations such as requiring cumbersome model ensembles or complex data augmentations at training time. There is a need for a test-time solution that can adapt models to corrupted inputs to improve robustness.

Proposed Solution - FROST:
The paper proposes a test-time optimization method called FROST (FFT-based Robust STatistics selection) that selects suitable normalization layer statistics conditioned on the input image corruption. 

Key Ideas:
- At training time, extract corruption-specific prototypes from FFT features of corrupted images and estimate corruption-specific normalization layer statistics. 
- At test time, extract FFT features from the corrupted input image, match them to prototypes to identify corruption type, then select the corresponding statistics using a codebook mapping.
- Apply selected statistics on normalization layers to adapt the model and improve robustness against that corruption.
- Handles uncertainty in corruption type using a threshold on prototype matching confidence.

Main Contributions:
- Novel test-time optimization approach to improve model robustness by adapting normalization statistics based on input corruption
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet-C benchmark, outperforming competitors significantly
- Applicable to multiple architectures and datasets with very limited overhead
- A pure test-time solution, allowing deployment on devices without retraining 

Key Results:
- Up to 37.1% relative mCE gain on ImageNet-C corruptions over baseline
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods like APR, AugMix+DA+HA
- Boosts robustness on severe corruptions while preserving clean image accuracy
- Low storage overhead (~0.7% params) and test-time computational overhead

In summary, the paper presents a highly effective test-time optimization approach to improve model robustness against corrupted inputs by identifying corruption type and adapting normalization statistics accordingly. The method achieves new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-C with minimal overhead.
