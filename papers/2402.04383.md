## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on analyzing and mitigating structural bias in both real-world and synthetically generated graphs for machine learning tasks. Structural bias refers to unfairness that results from disparities in graph topology connectivity patterns across groups with sensitive attributes (e.g. race, gender). This is an important issue as graph neural networks, which learn over graph structures, can amplify such biases leading to unfair predictions especially for link prediction tasks. 

First, the paper provides a theoretical analysis to identify key factors in graph topology that contribute to disparities in link prediction across sensitive groups. Unlike prior work, this analysis considers non-binary sensitive attributes. Key identified factors are ratios of intra-group to inter-group edge connections. 

Based on this analysis, the paper proposes a novel structural fairness regularizer, L_FairWire, that can be incorporated into both link prediction and graph generation models. The regularizer aims to balance ratios of expected intra- and inter-group edge connections to mitigate bias.

The paper then empirically evaluates how existing graph generation methods can amplify structural biases on real graph data. To address this, they propose FairWire, a diffusion-based graph generation framework that trains a message-passing neural network guided by sensitive attributes to produce fair synthetic graphs. 

Key benefits are: 1) Versatile structural bias regularizer for multiple graph learning tasks 2) Analysis and mitigation of bias amplification in graph generation methods 3) Synthetic graph generation that captures relations between topology and sensitive attributes to enable debiasing without exposing private attributes.

Experiments validate efficacy of proposed techniques over real-world graphs by showing significant improvements in fairness metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods for both link prediction and graph generation with minimal utility loss. The analysis and tools provide valuable insights and advances for promoting algorithmic fairness in graph machine learning.
