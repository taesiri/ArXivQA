# [Statler: State-Maintaining Language Models for Embodied Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17840)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can large language models (LLMs) be better leveraged for long-horizon robotic planning tasks? The key hypothesis is that equipping LLMs with an external world state model to explicitly track state updates over time will improve their capacity for long-term reasoning in robotics applications.Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called Statler that uses a world-model reader LLM and a world-model writer LLM to interact with and maintain a symbolic world state representation. This aims to mitigate the limited context window and implicit memory of standard LLMs when reasoning over complex planning tasks with long action sequences.The experiments then evaluate whether Statler enables better performance on simulated tabletop manipulation tasks and a real robot task compared to a strong baseline method (Code-as-Policies) without an explicit world model. The results suggest that maintaining the external world state does indeed improve the long-term reasoning capabilities of the LLM.In summary, the central hypothesis is that augmenting LLMs with a persistent, updatable symbolic world model will make them more suitable for long-horizon robotic planning problems needing memory over many time steps. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform long-horizon robotic planning tasks. Specifically, the paper argues that existing methods that use LLMs for robotics struggle with long-horizon planning due to the limited context window of LLMs. The key hypothesis is that equipping LLMs with an external world state model to explicitly track state information over time will improve their ability to reason and plan over longer horizons.The central goal of the paper is to develop a framework called Statler that maintains an external world state model using two LLM modules - a world model reader and a world model writer. The world model reader generates plans and code based on user instructions and the current world state, while the world model writer updates the external state representation after actions are taken. The central hypothesis is that by relying on this explicit external state model rather than just the implicit memory of the LLM, Statler will enable LLMs to successfully carry out long-horizon robot planning tasks that require reasoning over an extended time history. The paper evaluates this hypothesis through experiments in simulated tabletop domains as well as a real robot domain.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Statler, a framework that augments large language models (LLMs) with an explicit external representation of the world state to improve their ability to reason over long time horizons for robot planning tasks. Key points:- Robot planning tasks often require reasoning over long time horizons and remembering information from the past, which is challenging for LLMs due to their limited context window. - Statler maintains a structured world state representation that serves as an explicit "memory" and handles updating it over time using two components: a world-model reader and a world-model writer. Both are instantiated using general LLMs.- The world-model reader generates code to respond to user queries by reading the current world state. The world-model writer updates the world state based on the effects of actions.- By providing access to this explicit world state "memory" that persists over time, Statler enhances the long-term reasoning capacity of standard LLMs like Codex.- Experiments in simulated tabletop domains and a real robot domain demonstrate improved performance over Codex and state-of-the-art methods on tasks requiring temporal reasoning.In summary, the key contribution is using an explicit world state model manipulated by prompted LLMs to augment standard LLMs to perform better sequential reasoning for robot planning over long horizons. This improves on methods that rely solely on LLMs' limited implicit memory.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work in language models for robotics:- It focuses specifically on improving long-term reasoning capabilities. Many existing methods like Do-AI, CLIPort, and Code-as-Policies demonstrate impressive language-guided robotic skills, but struggle with long time horizons due to the limited context window of current LLMs. This paper addresses that limitation.- It proposes an explicit external world state model to act as "memory". Other methods rely solely on the implicit memory of LLMs or augment with current visual observations. Maintaining an explicit state representation that persists over time is a unique aspect of this work. - It employs a modular design with separate reader and writer modules. Most prior work uses a single LLM monolithically. Splitting into specialized modules reduces the reasoning burden and provides other advantages like the potential to use smaller/cheaper LLMs for some components.- The world state representation is flexible and human-readable. In contrast, some related work uses formal symbolic representations tailored for a domain. The semi-structured language here can be adapted across tasks.- It demonstrates simulated and real-world robotic evaluations across multiple tabletop domains. The complexity and breadth of the evaluation scenarios goes beyond what most related works have shown in terms of language-guided robot planning.In summary, the core novelty is using explicit external state representations to address a key weakness in LLMs for robotics. And it shows this meaningfully improves performance on complex planning tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The modular design and flexible state representation are also notable aspects of this work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several directions for future work:- Exploring different state representation formats beyond the JSON-like structured representation used in this work. They mention numerical representations that allow reasoning about object coordinates and sizes.- Automatically generating the world state model, rather than designing it by hand for each task. The authors propose the possibility of using the LLMs themselves to automatically design the state representation. - Incorporating visual representations and multi-modal reasoning, rather than relying solely on text representations. As more capable multi-modal LLMs become available, integrating visual information into the state model is an important next step.- Adding feedback loops to handle execution errors. Currently the method assumes the generated code executes successfully. Feedback from external modules like vision could help detect and handle execution failures to prevent propagating incorrect state updates.- Leveraging different LLMs for the reader and writer roles, rather than using the same LLM. For example, using a smaller or locally-hosted LLM for the writer if that role proves simpler than the reader.- Applying the approach to more complex planning problems and state spaces, to further analyze its effectiveness and limitations.In summary, the main future directions are: exploring alternative state representations, automating state model creation, incorporating visual reasoning, adding feedback mechanisms, customizing the reader/writer models, and evaluation on more complex domains. The authors lay out a promising research path building on the ideas introduced in this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: The paper proposes Statler, a framework that augments large language models (LLMs) with an explicit external representation of the world state to improve their capacity for long-horizon robotic planning and reasoning. Statler consists of two main components - a world-model reader LLM that interacts with users and responds to queries, and a world-model writer LLM that maintains the external world state representation. By splitting up the tasks between specialized reader and writer LLMs, Statler reduces the load on each LLM compared to having a single LLM handle querying and state tracking together. The world state helps address the limited context window of LLMs by providing persistent external memory. Statler is evaluated on several simulated tabletop manipulation tasks as well as a real robot tabletop domain, and is shown to improve performance over prior LLM-based methods on tasks requiring long-term reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key ideas from the paper:The paper proposes Statler, a framework that improves the long-term reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for robot planning tasks. Statler consists of a world-model reader LLM and a world-model writer LLM that explicitly maintain an external world state representation. The world-model reader responds to user queries by generating code that executes actions, while the world-model writer tracks how those actions update the world state. By maintaining this explicit external state, Statler alleviates the limited context window that hinders the long-horizon reasoning abilities of standard LLMs. The authors evaluate Statler on several simulated tabletop manipulation tasks as well as one real robot domain. The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling the world state enables Statler to successfully reason about tasks that require remembering information from many steps in the past, which existing LLM methods struggle with. Statler also outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM approach on the benchmark tasks. Overall, the external world state representation helps address the long-standing challenge of long-term reasoning for LLMs and improves their applicability to robot planning problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes Statler, a framework that augments large language models (LLMs) with an explicit representation of the world state to improve their reasoning capability over long time horizons for robot planning tasks. The key idea is to maintain a separate world state model that is updated over time and interfaced using two LLM modules - a world-model reader and a world-model writer. The world-model reader generates code to execute user commands and query the world state, while the world-model writer updates the explicit world state representation based on the effects of executed commands. By providing the LLMs access to this external "memory" of world state, Statler aims to mitigate issues like limited context window that hinder long-term reasoning in vanilla LLMs. Experiments on simulated tabletop tasks and real robot manipulation validate Statler's ability to handle temporal reasoning better than prior methods. The overall framework is general and flexible in how the world state can be represented.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading, the key contributions and innovations of this paper are:1. It addresses the issue of limited context window in large language models (LLMs), which makes long-horizon reasoning difficult when applying LLMs to robot planning tasks. The paper proposes a framework called Statler that maintains an external world state representation to enhance the long-term reasoning capacity of LLMs. 2. The core of Statler is the use of two LLM modules - a world-model reader and a world-model writer. The reader handles responding to user queries based on the current world state, while the writer is responsible for anticipating and updating the world state representation after each user action. This split architecture reduces the reasoning burden on a single LLM.3. The world state is maintained in a structured text format which is shown to be more effective for LLMs compared to free-form text. The reader and writer are trained using demonstrations to manipulate this state representation.4. Experiments in simulated table-top manipulation tasks and a real robot domain demonstrate that Statler outperforms previous LLM methods without explicit state maintenance, especially on long-horizon reasoning queries. It shows the advantage of augmenting LLMs with an external world model.In summary, the key innovation is the architecture design that equips LLMs with an explicit world state representation to enhance their long-term reasoning and planning capabilities for robotics applications. The demonstration of strong empirical results further validates the efficacy of this proposed approach.
