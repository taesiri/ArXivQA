# Statler: State-Maintaining Language Models for Embodied Reasoning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can large language models (LLMs) be better leveraged for long-horizon robotic planning tasks? The key hypothesis is that equipping LLMs with an external world state model to explicitly track state updates over time will improve their capacity for long-term reasoning in robotics applications.Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called Statler that uses a world-model reader LLM and a world-model writer LLM to interact with and maintain a symbolic world state representation. This aims to mitigate the limited context window and implicit memory of standard LLMs when reasoning over complex planning tasks with long action sequences.The experiments then evaluate whether Statler enables better performance on simulated tabletop manipulation tasks and a real robot task compared to a strong baseline method (Code-as-Policies) without an explicit world model. The results suggest that maintaining the external world state does indeed improve the long-term reasoning capabilities of the LLM.In summary, the central hypothesis is that augmenting LLMs with a persistent, updatable symbolic world model will make them more suitable for long-horizon robotic planning problems needing memory over many time steps. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform long-horizon robotic planning tasks. Specifically, the paper argues that existing methods that use LLMs for robotics struggle with long-horizon planning due to the limited context window of LLMs. The key hypothesis is that equipping LLMs with an external world state model to explicitly track state information over time will improve their ability to reason and plan over longer horizons.The central goal of the paper is to develop a framework called Statler that maintains an external world state model using two LLM modules - a world model reader and a world model writer. The world model reader generates plans and code based on user instructions and the current world state, while the world model writer updates the external state representation after actions are taken. The central hypothesis is that by relying on this explicit external state model rather than just the implicit memory of the LLM, Statler will enable LLMs to successfully carry out long-horizon robot planning tasks that require reasoning over an extended time history. The paper evaluates this hypothesis through experiments in simulated tabletop domains as well as a real robot domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposes Statler, a framework that augments LLMs with an explicit external representation of the world state to improve their long-term reasoning abilities for robot planning tasks. 2. The key components of Statler are the world-model reader and world-model writer, which are separate prompted LLMs that interface with and maintain the external world state representation.3. Demonstrates the effectiveness of Statler on three simulated table-top manipulation domains (pick-and-place, block disinfection, weight reasoning) and a real robot domain, showing improved performance over baseline LLMs on tasks requiring long-term reasoning.4. Provides an analysis of the failures of baseline LLMs on long-horizon planning tasks, attributing it to their limited context window and challenges in accurately tracking world state implicitly over long time horizons.5. Shows the flexibility of the framework by designing customized world state representations for each task while still using general LLMs for reading and writing the state.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and experimentally validating a technique to augment LLMs with an explicit external world state representation to improve their long-term reasoning capacities for robot planning tasks. The key ideas are the world-model reader/writer architecture and demonstrating benefits across several embodied reasoning domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing Statler, a framework that augments large language models (LLMs) with an explicit external representation of the world state to improve their ability to reason over long time horizons for robot planning tasks. Key points:- Robot planning tasks often require reasoning over long time horizons and remembering information from the past, which is challenging for LLMs due to their limited context window. - Statler maintains a structured world state representation that serves as an explicit "memory" and handles updating it over time using two components: a world-model reader and a world-model writer. Both are instantiated using general LLMs.- The world-model reader generates code to respond to user queries by reading the current world state. The world-model writer updates the world state based on the effects of actions.- By providing access to this explicit world state "memory" that persists over time, Statler enhances the long-term reasoning capacity of standard LLMs like Codex.- Experiments in simulated tabletop domains and a real robot domain demonstrate improved performance over Codex and state-of-the-art methods on tasks requiring temporal reasoning.In summary, the key contribution is using an explicit world state model manipulated by prompted LLMs to augment standard LLMs to perform better sequential reasoning for robot planning over long horizons. This improves on methods that rely solely on LLMs' limited implicit memory.
