# [GEM3D: GEnerative Medial Abstractions for 3D Shape Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16994)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing 3D shape generative models often struggle to accurately capture fine topological details and connectivity in synthesize shapes. They also lack intuitive control over the shape structure during generation. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel deep generative model called GEM3D that is centered around a skeleton-based shape representation aiming to address the above issues. The key ideas are:

1) Capture the shape structure and topology compactly through a point-based medial axis approximation called the medial abstraction. This skeletal representation serves as an interpretable intermediate proxy for the shape.

2) Generate the medial abstractions automatically through a diffusion-based deep generative model. Alternatively, artists can also create such abstractions manually.  

3) Decode each medial abstraction into a surface by learning an ensemble of local neural implicit functions. Each local implicit is conditioned on a medial point's position and a corresponding latent code that allows encoding of geometric details.

Main Contributions:

- A topology-aware generative model that can synthesize shapes along with their skeletal approximations in a fully automated manner.

- Applications in diverse tasks like shape synthesis from text prompts, point cloud reconstruction, and user-driven shape generation by providing skeletons.

- Significantly more accurate surface reconstruction and generation compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, especially for topologically complex shapes.

- Intuitive control over shape structure generation through the underlying skeletal representations.

In summary, the paper introduces a structured deep generative model for 3D shapes based on intermediate skeletal representations that leads to more topologically accurate and controllable shape synthesis.
