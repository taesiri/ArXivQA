# [Diving Deep into Regions: Exploiting Regional Information Transformer   for Single Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Single image deraining (SID) is an important but challenging task due to the ill-posed nature of removing rain from a single image. 
- Current SID methods do not differentiate between rain-affected and unaffected regions in an image. However, there are significant disparities between these two types of regions that need to be handled distinctly.
- Overlooking these disparities results in confusion between rain streaks and background details, inability to obtain effective interactions between regions, and suboptimal deraining outcomes.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel SID method called Region Transformer (Regformer) that processes rain-affected and unaffected regions separately while considering their combined impact for reconstructing a high-quality image.

- The key innovation is the Region Transformer Block (RTB) consisting of two main components:
   1) Region Masked Attention (RMA): Applies selective masking to the query and key values during attention to generate attention maps exclusive to rain-affected, unaffected regions and their interactions. This allows capturing comprehensive features essential for deraining.
   2) Mixed Gate Forward Block (MGFB): Models local interactions at mixed scales to better recover textures and preserve local details.

- Additional components: Uses encoder-decoder architecture, skip connections between encoder and decoder, and a region transformer cascade (RTC) in decoder consisting of multiple RTBs with different masking strategies.

Main Contributions:
- Novel region attention mechanism to acquire essential features for state-of-the-art SID performance
- Innovative RTB with RMA to efficiently capture comprehensive features from the two regions and their interactions
- MGFB to perceive local mixed-scale features between adjacent pixels for improved local detail modeling
- State-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets outperforming existing methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions by proposing the Regformer model that processes rain-affected and unaffected regions distinctly by using tailored region masks and modeling local interactions at mixed scales. This leads to improved feature learning and reconstruction, achieving superior deraining quality over existing methods.
