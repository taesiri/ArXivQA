# [Deep learning automates Cobb angle measurement compared with   multi-expert observers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Scoliosis requires accurate measurement of spinal curvature (Cobb angle) for diagnosis and treatment planning. 
- Manual measurement of Cobb angles is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and suffers from significant interobserver and intraobserver variability.
- Existing automated methods have limitations in accuracy, reliability, interpretability, and/or require extensive annotations.

Proposed Solution:
- Develops a fully automated deep learning based system to measure Cobb angles from spine x-rays.
- Uses Mask R-CNN to simultaneously detect and segment the full spine region.
- Fits a curve to the spine's centerline and identifies optimal tilt points based on derivative analysis.
- Measures Cobb angles between titled vertebrae using a tolerance range to match clinical practice.
- Visualizes measured Cobb angles directly on original x-rays for interpretation.

Main Contributions:
- Complete end-to-end pipeline for automated Cobb angle quantification with low annotation costs.  
- Innovative spine-based method, not reliant on individual vertebrae, enhancing reliability.
- Achieves mean measurement difference of 4.17 degrees compared to 7 expert readers, outperforming the 5.17 degree inter-reader variability. 
- Demonstrates robust performance across diverse scoliosis cases and x-ray qualities.
- Provides full visibility into Cobb angle determination for improved clinical utility.
- Comprehensive multi-reader study proving consensus and reliability equivalent to human experts.

In summary, the paper presents a novel automated and interpretable approach for Cobb angle measurement that demonstrates strong reliability and matching with experienced readers, representing a promising tool for improving scoliosis assessment.
