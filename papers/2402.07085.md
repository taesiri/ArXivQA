# [Speech Rhythm-Based Speaker Embeddings Extraction from Phonemes and   Phoneme Duration for Multi-Speaker Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07085)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional speaker embeddings for multi-speaker speech synthesis (e.g. x-vectors) mainly capture acoustic features like spectra and F0. However, speech rhythm is also an essential aspect of speaker identity. 
- Not explicitly modeling speech rhythm leads to synthesized speech having rhythm that sounds less similar to the target speaker.

Proposed Solution:
- Extract speaker embeddings that capture speech rhythm characteristics using phonemes and their durations as input features.  
- Phonemes and durations are known to relate to speech rhythm.
- Use them as input to a speaker identification model similar to how x-vectors are extracted.

Contributions:
- Show that speaker ID is possible to some extent (15.2% EER) from just phonemes and durations, indicating they capture speaker identity.
- Proposed embeddings can predict target speaker's phoneme durations more accurately than x-vectors in an open-speaker setup.
- Speech synthesized with proposed embeddings is perceived as more similar to target speakers than that with x-vectors.
- Visualizations and similarity analyses indicate proposed embeddings cluster utterances with similar rhythm closer than x-vectors.
- Overall demonstrates phoneme+duration based embeddings can better capture speech rhythm and generate speech closer to targets' rhythm.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel method to extract speaker embeddings that focus more on modeling speech rhythm by using phonemes and their durations as input. Experiments show these rhythm-based embeddings can synthesize speech with rhythm better matching unseen target speakers.
