# [Non-Cross Diffusion for Semantic Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper identifies a phenomenon called "cross diffusion" (\xflow) in diffusion models, where the generative flow during training crosses/intersects, causing inconsistencies. 
- This leads to semantic inconsistencies in generated images across different sampling steps during inference. It also results in out-of-distribution or low quality samples.
- The root cause is identified as the ambiguity in training targets when flows intersect, providing the model incorrect targets.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Non-Cross Diffusion" (\ncd), a novel generative modeling approach using ordinary differential equations.  
- The key idea is to increase the dimensionality of the model's inputs to connect points from the two distributions with straight, non-crossing paths.  
- This is achieved by using the predicted noise as an additional condition, which helps differentiate between flows. A bootstrap strategy is used during training to avoid misleading the predicted noise.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies the widespread \xflow phenomenon in diffusion models leading to non-straight flows and inconsistencies.
- Attributes the cause to unstable targets during training due to flow intersections.
- Proposes the \ncd method which resolves \xflow by enhancing input dimensionality and using predicted noise as condition.
- Introduces a new metric, Inference Flow Consistency, to evaluate consistency across sampling steps.
- Experiments on a toy model and CIFAR dataset demonstrate \ncd not only improves the metric but also enhances sample quality over baselines.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in analyzing, resolving and evaluating semantic inconsistencies in diffusion models using the proposed \ncd technique.
