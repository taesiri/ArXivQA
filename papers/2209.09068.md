# [Audio-Visual Fusion for Emotion Recognition in the Valence-Arousal Space   Using Joint Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09068)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Dimensional emotion recognition (ER) from videos is important for many applications but challenging due to subtle and continuous emotions displayed. 
- Using multiple modalities like audio (A) and visual (V) improves performance but effectively fusing them is difficult.
- Most fusion techniques don't fully leverage complementary inter-modal and intra-modal relationships.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Joint Cross-Attention (JCA) model to fuse A and V modalities for video-based dimensional ER.
- Extract A and V features independently using deep networks first.
- Then apply cross-attention between joint A+V features and individual A and V features.
- This allows features of each modality to attend to itself and the other modality.
- Captures both inter-modal relationships (across A and V) as well as intra-modal relationships (within A or V over time).

Main Contributions:
- JCA can effectively exploit complementary inter- and intra-modal relationships for robust A-V fusion.  
- Handles missing/noisy modalities well by relying on joint representation.
- Validated on RECOLA and Affwild2 datasets, achieves state-of-the-art performance.
- Visualization confirms that JCA focuses on emotionally salient regions in A-V modalities.
- Simple yet efficient method for leveraging relationships across and within modalities.

In summary, the paper introduces a Joint Cross-Attention model to effectively fuse audio and visual modalities for video-based continuous emotion recognition by simultaneously modeling inter- and intra-modal relationships. This provides robust performance even with missing modalities.
