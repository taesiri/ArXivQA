## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LinguaLinked, a novel system for enabling decentralized and distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) across multiple mobile devices. The key innovation is segmenting a large LLM into smaller partitions that align with the memory and computational constraints of individual mobile devices. An optimized model assignment strategy employs linear optimization to allocate model segments to devices based on their heterogeneous capabilities. LinguaLinked also implements a runtime load balancer to dynamically redistribute tasks and prevent bottlenecks. Additionally, an optimized communication mechanism coordinates structured data flow between model segments using transmission maps while maintaining model integrity. Evaluations demonstrate LinguaLinked facilitates efficient distributed execution for both quantized and full-precision LLMs, with up to 2.65x acceleration over the baseline. The system is especially effective for larger models and offers particular benefits in terms of enhanced privacy from on-device processing, reduced reliance on server computation, lower latency through localized inference, and flexibility across mobile platforms. LinguaLinked represents an important advancement in deploying complex LLMs on resource-constrained mobile devices.

2. It designs an optimized model assignment strategy that employs linear optimization to assign LLM segments to devices in alignment with their capabilities, while also reducing data transmission overhead between devices. 

3. It builds a runtime load balancer that actively monitors devices and redistributes tasks to prevent bottlenecks and optimize overall system performance during inference.

4. It implements an optimized data transmission mechanism using data transmission maps to facilitate efficient and structured data flow between LLM segments on different devices. 

5. It demonstrates up to 2.65x acceleration in inference throughput compared to a baseline approach through extensive evaluation on both high-end and low-end Android devices.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deploying large language models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices is challenging due to their extensive memory requirements. Traditional approaches of aggressive quantization or sending data to servers have downsides like reduced accuracy or privacy concerns. There is a need for a system that can facilitate efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained mobile devices while maintaining accuracy and data privacy.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes LinguaLinked, a decentralized, distributed system for LLM inference across trusted mobile devices. LinguaLinked segments a large LLM across multiple devices so each handles a smaller portion, reducing the burden. It uses optimized model assignment, runtime load balancing, and communication strategies.

Key strategies:
1) Optimized model assignment aligns model segments with device capabilities using linear optimization, minimizing data transmission overhead. 
2) Runtime load balancer monitors devices, identifies bottlenecks, and redistributes tasks accordingly for optimal resource utilization.
3) Optimized communication uses data transmission maps to structure data flow between model segments, minimizing latency.

Contributions:
- First system for decentralized distributed LLM inference on mobile devices
- Optimized model assignment strategy employing linear optimization 
- Runtime load balancer that actively monitors and redistributes tasks
- Optimized data transmission mechanism to facilitate efficient structured data flow
- Enables inference of LLMs too large for a single mobile device with up to 2.65x acceleration.

In summary, LinguaLinked provides a distributed approach to deploying large language models on resource-constrained mobile devices through optimized assignment, load balancing and communication mechanisms. By splitting an LLM across devices, it facilitates privacy-preserving collaborative inference while enhancing efficiency.
