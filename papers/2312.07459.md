# [Codesign of Humanoid Robots for Ergonomy Collaboration with Multiple   Humans via Genetic Algorithms and Nonlinear Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07459)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel bilevel optimization approach to design optimal humanoid robots for physically collaborating with multiple humans on payload lifting tasks. The method leverages a genetic algorithm to explore combinations of hardware parameters like link geometries, densities, and joint motor specifications. Each robot design generated is evaluated by solving nonlinear optimization problems that minimize human and robot joint torque metrics, representing energy expenditure, for interactions with different humans and payloads. By considering diverse collaboration scenarios, the framework identifies robot designs tailored to improve ergonomics across users and tasks. Compared to prior nonlinear optimization, the proposed technique reduces robot energy expenditure by over 40% for a human collaboration study, and by 38% for a dynamic lifting task, demonstrating enhanced postural ergonomics. The parametrized modeling and bilevel co-design methodology offers promise for optimizing future assistive robots like the ergoCub2 for safe and efficient physical assistance across populations.
