# [Sebastian, Basti, Wastl?! Recognizing Named Entities in Bavarian   Dialectal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12749)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Named entity recognition (NER) is an important NLP task but lacks quality annotated datasets for dialects. 
- Bavarian German is a major dialect with over 10 million speakers but has no NER dataset. Its lexical and syntactic features differ from standard German.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces BarNER, the first manually annotated NER corpus for the Bavarian dialect with 161K tokens from Wikipedia articles and tweets.

- BarNER uses the standard CoNLL NER types (PER/LOC/ORG/MISC) plus additional fine-grained types adapted from GermEval 2014. Half the corpus has double annotations.

- The paper analyzes token/entity distinctions between Bavarian and standard German NER over Wikipedia, tweets and news. It finds larger cross-dialectal differences than cross-genre ones within German.

Key Contributions:
- Establishes strong baselines and state-of-the-art results on Bavarian NER using neural models (MaChAmp) and multilingual LMs (XLM-R).

- Shows the benefit of incorporating standard German NER data via sequential/joint training. Training first on Bavarian also slightly helps German NER.

- Introduces multi-task learning between NER and Bavarian-German dialect identification. Achieves best performance on Bavarian Wikipedia NER, substantiating the value of multi-genre dialectal data.

- Provides the first publicly available high-quality NER dataset for a German dialect, enabling future work on non-standard language varieties and contributing to diversity in NLP resources.
