# How susceptible are LLMs to Logical Fallacies?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research questions that this paper addresses are:1) Can large language models (LLMs) change their opinions through reasoning when faced with new arguments? 2) Are large language models susceptible to fallacious reasoning?The paper introduces a new diagnostic benchmark called LOGICOM to assess the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, LOGICOM evaluates whether LLMs can alter their point of view through reasoning when engaged in multi-round debates, and if they are prone to being misled by logical fallacies. The authors use LOGICOM to test two LLMs - GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The key findings are:- Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 demonstrate an ability to change their opinions through reasoning, indicating they can adjust their logical thinking process. - However, the LLMs are highly susceptible to fallacious reasoning - they are much more likely to be convinced by fallacious arguments compared to logical arguments.So in summary, the central research questions focus on assessing whether LLMs can evolve their reasoning, and testing their robustness against logical fallacies. The benchmark LOGICOM is introduced to diagnose the logical competence of LLMs through multi-agent debates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be the introduction of a new diagnostic benchmark called LOGICOM to assess the logical reasoning capabilities and susceptibility to logical fallacies of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Specifically, LOGICOM:- Allows testing whether LLMs can change their opinions through reasoning when presented with new arguments. - Evaluates how susceptible LLMs are to being convinced by logical fallacies vs logical reasoning.- Uses a dataset of controversial topics/claims to have a "persuader" LLM try to convince a "debater" LLM.- Employs a "fallacious helper" LLM to assist the persuader in using fallacies. - Compares debates where the persuader uses fallacies vs logical reasoning to see if the debater is more easily convinced by fallacies.- Finds GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can change opinions through reasoning but are 41-69% more convinced by fallacies than logical arguments.- Introduces a new dataset of over 5K pairs of logical/fallacious arguments from the debates.So in summary, the main contribution is introducing LOGICOM as a new benchmark to assess and compare the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and showing the susceptibility of major models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to logical fallacies through experiments using this benchmark. The paper also provides a new dataset based on the LOGICOM debates.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces a benchmark called LOGICOM to evaluate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in multi-round debates; it finds these models can change their opinions through reasoning but are highly susceptible to being misled by fallacious arguments, and it releases a new dataset of logical vs fallacious debate arguments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper comparing to other related research:- The use of a multi-agent debate framework to assess logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on evaluating LLMs on specific reasoning tasks rather than a free-form, multi-round debate setting. - The idea of specifically testing susceptibility to logical fallacies is also unique. Many studies have looked at LLMs' reasoning abilities more broadly, but few have directly tested how prone they are to different types of fallacious arguments. This provides useful insight into a specific limitation.- The proposed LOGICOM benchmark seems more comprehensive than many existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM reasoning. It allows probing change of opinions over multiple rounds of debate and contrasting logical vs fallacious arguments.- The use of a separate "fallacious helper" LLM to generate the fallacies is an interesting idea to isolate the effects without confusing the main persuader agent. This is a clever experimental design choice.- The creation of a new dataset of logical/fallacious argument pairs extracted from model debates is a valuable contribution. Most logical fallacy datasets are limited to individual fallacious statements without context.- In terms of limitations, the reliance on models for all agents (persuaders, helper, moderator) could also introduce errors vs using humans. But this choice is reasonable given the complexity.- The analysis is mainly qualitative at this stage. More quantitative rigor could be added to strengthen the claims, but the overall approach is sound.In summary, the multi-agent debate design, focus on logical fallacies, new benchmark and dataset make this study fairly unique and advance the broader goal of understanding and improving LLM reasoning. The results align with and build upon recent findings about the brittleness of large models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions at the end of the paper, including:- Performing more comprehensive and repetitive evaluations of LLMs to address the effects of inconsistency in model outputs. They point out that repeating the evaluation 3 times for each claim may be insufficient to achieve statistical significance.- Evaluating more LLM models beyond just GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. They note that many other LLMs require similar analysis before widespread adoption.- Using human persuaders/helpers instead of LLM agents. They suggest this could allow for more accurate persuasive arguments to better demonstrate the debater LLM's susceptibility to fallacies.- Improving the moderator LLMs to prevent early debate termination or inaccuracies in reporting the debater's stance.- Investigating why certain logical fallacies like ad hominem seem more convincing to the debater LLMs.- Expanding the number of debate repetitions to better assess model consistency in reasoning across repeated claims.- Comparing consistency systematically between models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 where they observed differing levels of variability.- Evaluating the interplay between same-model agents, like two GPT-3.5s, where one uses fallacies the other fails to detect.- Interpreting the causes of model inconsistencies through more research.In summary, they recommend enhancements to the evaluation process and setup, expanding to more models, and further analysis into the reasoning inconsistencies and fallacy susceptibility exhibited by LLMs. The key goal is developing more robust evaluations of rational thinking in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces Logic Competence Measurement (LOGICOM), a benchmark to assess the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in multi-round debates. Specifically, it evaluates whether LLMs can change their opinions through reasoning when presented with new arguments, and if they are susceptible to fallacious reasoning. The authors use LOGICOM to test GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in debates where a persuader agent tries to convince a debater agent of a claim. The results indicate that both models are able to alter their stances through reasoning around 16-20% of the time. However, they are also highly susceptible to logical fallacies - when presented with fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are convinced 41% and 69% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used. The authors propose a new dataset of over 5k logical/fallacious argument pairs extracted from the debates. Overall, the work demonstrates GPT models can change reasoning but are vulnerable to fallacies, highlighting the need for further development in rational thinking for LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates the susceptibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to logical fallacies and their ability to change opinions through reasoning. The authors propose a benchmark called LOGICOM that engages two AI agents, a persuader and a debater, in multi-round debates on controversial topics. The persuader tries to convince the debater of its claim using either logical reasoning or fallacious arguments. The results indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are able to change their opinions through reasoning in some cases. However, they are much more likely to be persuaded by fallacious arguments compared to logical reasoning - around 40% more for GPT-3.5 and 70% more for GPT-4. This suggests these models are highly susceptible to logical fallacies. The authors also introduce a new dataset of over 5,000 pairs of logical and fallacious arguments extracted from the multi-round debates generated by the models. Overall, the paper demonstrates that while LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can alter their opinions through reasoning, they lack robustness against fallacies which significantly influences their stance. More research is needed to improve logical reasoning in LLMs.In summary, this paper:- Proposes LOGICOM, a new benchmark to evaluate LLM's susceptibility to logical fallacies - Finds GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can change opinions through reasoning but are far more persuaded by fallacies- Introduces a dataset of logical vs fallacious arguments from LLM debates - Concludes more progress is needed to improve logical reasoning robustness in LLMs against fallacies


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper introduces Logic Competence Measurement (LOGICOM), a benchmark to assess the logical reasoning capabilities and susceptibility to fallacies of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in multi-round debates. LOGICOM initiates a persuader and debater agent that engage in debate over a controversial topic where the persuader tries convincing the debater of a claim. The benchmark conducts debates under 3 scenarios: 1) persuader uses logical reasoning, 2) persuader uses fallacious arguments with a separate fallacious helper LLM, and 3) persuader uses logical arguments with a logical helper LLM. By comparing scenarios 1 and 2, the benchmark evaluates whether the debater agent changes its stance due to fallacious reasoning, indicating susceptibility. The authors test GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as debater agents using 200 claims on controversial topics. They find evidence that GPT models can change opinions through reasoning but are 41-69% more likely to be convinced by fallacies than logical arguments, demonstrating susceptibility.
