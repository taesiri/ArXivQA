# [Automatic Interactive Evaluation for Large Language Models with State   Aware Patient Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08495)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain rely on static medical knowledge assessments rather than realistic doctor-patient interactions. This misalignment hinders the practical application of medical LLMs. 
- Costly human evaluations that simulate clinical scenarios provide insight but lack scalability. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an Automatic Interactive Evaluation (AIE) framework that leverages LLM capabilities for role-playing to create a doctor LLM and patient simulator for assessment.
- A State Aware Patient Simulator (SAPS) is proposed to recognize doctor LLM actions and provide tailored, high-quality responses like a real patient. 

Key Contributions:
- Realistic automatic assessment of medical LLM consultation abilities through simulated doctor-patient interactions.
- SAPS architecture that demonstrates superior stability in extended dialogues and higher correlation to human behavior than baseline patient simulators.
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation showing alignment between automated metrics and human judgements, underscoring AIE's potential for practical medical LLM testing.
- Analysis providing insights into current model limitations, such as weaker performance in advice compared to inquiries, and the potential benefits of interactive evaluation.

In summary, this paper introduces a scalable simulation-based evaluation approach for medical LLMs that approximates the complexity of real clinical interactions. The proposed SAPS patient simulator and AIE framework enable detailed analysis of model behaviors to drive advancements in this crucial domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an Automatic Interactive Evaluation framework with a State Aware Patient Simulator to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models in simulated doctor-patient consultations for healthcare applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Automatic Interactive Evaluation (AIE) framework and the State Aware Patient Simulator (SAPS) to automatically evaluate the capabilities of large language models in realistic medical consultation scenarios. Specifically:

1) The AIE framework allows large language models acting as doctors to interactively gather patient information and make diagnoses through multi-turn dialogues with the SAPS patient simulator. This simulates actual clinical consultations more realistically compared to traditional static medical knowledge assessments.

2) The SAPS construct enables accurate modeling and tailored responses to various doctor actions during the consultation. Its components including a state tracker, memory bank, and response generator allow adaptive interactions that closely mimic real patients.  

3) Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of AIE and SAPS. The SAPS shows superior performance in simulating human patients. Additionally, AIE's evaluation metrics correlate well with human judgments, indicating its potential for credible assessment of medical LLMs.

In summary, AIE and SAPS provide an automated, scalable, and dynamic platform to evaluate LLMs on crucial clinical capabilities beyond just medical knowledge, filling an important gap towards their real-world medical applications.
