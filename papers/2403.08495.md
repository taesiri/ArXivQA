# [Automatic Interactive Evaluation for Large Language Models with State   Aware Patient Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08495)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the medical domain rely on static medical knowledge assessments rather than realistic doctor-patient interactions. This misalignment hinders the practical application of medical LLMs. 
- Costly human evaluations that simulate clinical scenarios provide insight but lack scalability. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces an Automatic Interactive Evaluation (AIE) framework that leverages LLM capabilities for role-playing to create a doctor LLM and patient simulator for assessment.
- A State Aware Patient Simulator (SAPS) is proposed to recognize doctor LLM actions and provide tailored, high-quality responses like a real patient. 

Key Contributions:
- Realistic automatic assessment of medical LLM consultation abilities through simulated doctor-patient interactions.
- SAPS architecture that demonstrates superior stability in extended dialogues and higher correlation to human behavior than baseline patient simulators.
- Comprehensive empirical evaluation showing alignment between automated metrics and human judgements, underscoring AIE's potential for practical medical LLM testing.
- Analysis providing insights into current model limitations, such as weaker performance in advice compared to inquiries, and the potential benefits of interactive evaluation.

In summary, this paper introduces a scalable simulation-based evaluation approach for medical LLMs that approximates the complexity of real clinical interactions. The proposed SAPS patient simulator and AIE framework enable detailed analysis of model behaviors to drive advancements in this crucial domain.
