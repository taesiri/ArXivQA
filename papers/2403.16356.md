# [Bipedal Safe Navigation over Uncertain Rough Terrain: Unifying Terrain   Mapping and Locomotion Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of bipedal robot navigation in environments with rough and uncertain terrain. Specifically, it considers a scenario where the terrain elevation is initially unknown, which creates untraversable regions and perturbs the motion of the robot. Thus, the robot must map the terrain online to improve locomotion performance while traversing towards a desired goal location. The problems of terrain mapping and locomotion stability are coupled, increasing the complexity.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a hierarchical planning framework with both global and local planners. Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to learn the unknown terrain elevation as well as motion deviations resulting from terrain and model errors. Three GP kernel methods are evaluated - RBF, neural network, and attentive kernel. 

The global planner uses a modified RRT* algorithm to generate a sequence of coarse waypoints leading towards the goal location while avoiding perceived obstacles. The local planner then plans detailed footstep trajectories between sequential waypoints from the global plan. The local planner uses another modified RRT* method with additional locomotion stability constraints.

A key contribution is a trajectory evaluation metric that minimizes expected motion deviation predicted by the GP model while maximizing terrain information gain. This balances locomotion stability and environmental sampling objectives.

The overall framework interleaves planning, trajectory execution, and online GP terrain mapping. New elevation data is collected along executed trajectories to iteratively improve map accuracy and locomotion feasibility.

Main Contributions:
- Hierarchical planning framework enabling efficient bipedal navigation with locomotion stability constraints
- Online Gaussian process learning of terrain elevation and motion deviations 
- Trajectory evaluation metric balancing environmental sampling and locomotion stability
- Integrated planning, control, and learning pipeline evaluated in dynamic simulations
