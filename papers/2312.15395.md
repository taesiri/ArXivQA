# [Prompt Valuation Based on Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can perform well on new tasks just using natural language prompts, without additional training. However, prompt quality varies greatly and more prompts do not necessarily improve performance.  
- There lacks a method to evaluate the contribution of each prompt in a prompt ensemble. This is important to identify beneficial vs detrimental prompts, optimize prompt combinations, and potentially guide prompt pricing.

Proposed Solution:
- Adopt Shapley value from cooperative game theory to measure the contribution of each prompt in an ensemble. Shapley value satisfies properties like balance, symmetry, additivity and zero element.
- Define utility functions tailored for different NLP tasks to quantify the marginal contribution of adding/removing a prompt.
- Use a truncated Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently estimate Shapley values by sampling prompt permutations.

Contributions:
- First work to apply Shapley value for equitable prompt valuation in LLMs. Helps identify important prompts and optimize ensemble methods.
- Offer utility functions for various NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering and machine translation. 
- Experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in distinguishing and quantifying prompt contributions.
- Low-value prompt removal and new prompt acquisition analyses further demonstrate the usefulness of estimated Shapley values.

In summary, the paper proposes using Shapley value to measure the contribution of prompts in LLMs, which helps build more effective prompt ensembles. Extensive experiments highlight the ability of this method to equitably value prompts.
