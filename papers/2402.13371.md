# [FIDLAR: Forecast-Informed Deep Learning Architecture for Flood   Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Floods in coastal river systems pose a major threat to lives and property. Strategic release of water using hydraulic structures like dams, gates, pumps etc. can help mitigate floods. 
- Current "rule-based" methods for water release are based on historical data and human experience. They can result in excess or inadequate water release.
- Alternative physics-based "Model Predictive Control" (MPC) methods are computationally intensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new deep learning based framework called "Forecast-Informed Deep Learning Architecture" (FIDLAR) for rapid and optimal flood management.

Key Components of FIDLAR:
- It integrates two neural network modules - "Flood Manager" to generate water release schedules, and "Flood Evaluator" to assess these schedules.
- The Evaluator is pre-trained to accurately forecast water levels for any release schedule. Its gradients guide the training of the Manager.
- Custom loss function balances flood risks and water wastage.
- Makes effective use of reliable forecast data like precipitation and tides.

Main Contributions:  
- FIDLAR is orders of magnitude faster than physics-based methods, while outperforming baselines.
- Demonstrates the first use of reliable forecast data like tides for flood mitigation using attention mechanism.
- Proposes a flexible framework combining forecasting and planning modules based on deep learning.
- Provides explainability features to understand complex system behaviors.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in developing a fast, optimal and interpretable AI system for real-time flood management in coastal rivers.
