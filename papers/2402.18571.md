# [Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional   Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing RLHF methods for aligning LLMs rely on scalar rewards, which have limited capacity for capturing complex and often conflicting human preferences across diverse users. This results in models aligned to an "average user", overlooking minority preferences.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Directional Preference Alignment (DPA), which represents user preferences as direction vectors in a multi-dimensional reward space. 
- DPA involves training a multi-objective reward model, then fine-tuning a single LLM model using a variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF) that conditions sampling/finetuning on user preference vectors.

Key Contributions:
- DPA allows intuitive arithmetic control over LLM generations by users specifying preference vectors, enabling better personalization.
- Experiments on aligning helpfulness and verbosity rewards with Mistral-7B show DPA effectively navigates preference trade-offs. 
- DPA offers competitive performance to state-of-the-art DPO, while providing better controllability over preference balancing.
- DPA addresses limitations of prior works like scalar rewards, reward soups, SteerLM regarding capturing diverse user preferences with a single model.

In summary, DPA advances LLM alignment and controllability to accommodate diverse user preferences within one model, through a directional preference representation and RSF-based finetuning approach. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness for arithmetic trade-off control between helpfulness and verbosity rewards.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Directional Preference Alignment, a novel reinforcement learning from human feedback method to align large language models for fine-grained, user-specific control over trade-offs between multiple reward objectives such as helpfulness and verbosity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework for aligning large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) DPA incorporates multi-objective rewards to represent diverse user preferences instead of relying on a single scalar reward as in conventional RLHF methods. This allows capturing preferences from different aspects (e.g. helpfulness, verbosity).

2) DPA models user preferences as directional vectors (unit vectors) in the multi-dimensional reward space. This enables intuitive arithmetic control over LLM generations during inference by tweaking the preference vector. 

3) The paper demonstrates DPA's effectiveness in balancing the trade-off between helpfulness and verbosity on the Mistral-7B model. DPA achieves competitive performance compared to strong baselines like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) while offering more fine-grained control.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing DPA to address limitations of scalar-reward RLHF methods and provide a framework for aligning LLMs that is adaptable to diverse user preferences in a controllable manner.

The paper proposes a new alignment method called Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) to address limitations of conventional RLHF methods that use scalar rewards. DPA incorporates multi-objective rewards and models user preferences as directions in the reward space. This allows flexible control over LLM generations based on different user-specified preferences. The method is applied to control the trade-off between helpfulness and verbosity objectives on the Mistral-7B model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the directional preference framework proposed in this paper allow for more granular and adaptive control over LLMs compared to conventional scalar reward models? Can you elaborate on the specifics of modeling user preferences as directions? 

2. The paper argues that a single scalar reward function may not sufficiently capture complex and often conflicting human preferences. Can you explain why this is the case, providing some illustrative examples? How does the multi-objective reward formulation help mitigate this issue?

3. The paper introduces a preference-conditioned variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF) for aligning the LLM. What are the benefits of using RSF over policy optimization methods like PPO? What modifications were made to the original RSF algorithm to accommodate multidimensional rewards and user preferences?

4. One of the stated advantages of the proposed method is providing intuitive arithmetic control over tradeoffs between different reward objectives. Can you walk through how a user would specify their preferences arithmetically and how that translates to model generations? 

5. The empirical evaluations focus on balancing helpfulness and verbosity rewards. Why is controlling for verbosity important? What trends were observed about the correlation between helpfulness and verbosity? 

6. What validation metrics were used to evaluate the ability of the proposed method to effectively explore the Pareto front? How did the empirical front progress over multiple finetuning iterations? 

7. The paper argues that the proposed method provides better coverage over the feasible reward space compared to alternatives like SteerLM. Can you explain the issues SteerLM faces regarding infeasible user-specified combinations of rewards?

8. What techniques were used to mitigate alignment tax and knowledge forgetting during finetuning iterations? How much original data was incorporated and why is this important?

9. The AlpacaEval results show some discrepancy compared to the validation reward evaluation. What might account for poorer generalization to GPT-4-turbo assessments despite strong validation performance?

10. What are some limitations of relying predominantly on the multi-objective reward model for alignment using the proposed method? How could deficiencies in the reward model undermine the overall approach?
