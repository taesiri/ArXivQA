# [Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02556)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is how to detect and ground manipulations in multi-modal media consisting of both images and text. Specifically, the paper introduces a new research problem called Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM^4). The goal is not only to classify whether an image-text pair is real or manipulated (binary classification), but also to detect the specific type of manipulation and ground/localize the manipulated regions in both image (bounding boxes) and text (tokens). This is a novel problem setting compared to existing works on single-modality deepfake image detection or text fake news detection, which only focus on binary classification. DGM^4 aims to provide more comprehensive and interpretable manipulation detection and grounding for multi-modal media.To study this problem, the paper makes the following key contributions:1) Proposes the DGM^4 problem and formulates rigorous evaluation protocols/metrics. 2) Constructs a large-scale DGM^4 dataset with diverse image/text manipulations and rich ground-truth annotations.3) Develops a Hierarchical Multi-modal Manipulation Reasoning Transformer (HAMMER) model to effectively capture semantic correlations and inconsistencies across modalities for manipulation detection and grounding.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by hierarchical reasoning on multi-modal correlations and grounding on both image and text regions, the model can achieve more accurate and interpretable detection of various manipulation types in multi-modal media. The experiments aim to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HAMMER model and benchmark the novel DGM^4 problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new research problem called Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM^4). This aims to not only detect the authenticity of multi-modal media (image-text pairs), but also ground the manipulated content (image bounding boxes and text tokens). 2. It contributes the first large-scale DGM^4 dataset, with image-text pairs manipulated using diverse techniques and rich annotations for detection and grounding tasks.3. It proposes a novel hierarchical multi-modal reasoning transformer model called HAMMER to capture fine-grained interactions between modalities for manipulation detection and grounding. 4. It builds an extensive benchmark with rigorous evaluation protocols and metrics to evaluate the new DGM^4 problem.5. It provides comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and reveal valuable observations to facilitate future research on multi-modal media manipulation.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel DGM^4 problem and introducing a suitable dataset, model architecture, evaluation benchmark and experiments to facilitate research in this new direction of multi-modal media manipulation detection and grounding.
