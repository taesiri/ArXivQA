## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents extensions to the SnAKe Bayesian optimization algorithm to make it more practical for real-world applications. The first extension enables self-stopping to avoid expending the full budget when additional experiments provide diminishing returns. The second extension constrains the maximum allowable input change between experiments to satisfy safety limits or physical constraints. The third extension adapts SnAKe to multi-objective optimization problems seeking to find a Pareto front rather than a single optimum. Experiments demonstrate superior performance of the self-stopping version over standard criteria, the benefits of input truncation for obeying movement constraints, and the ability of multi-objective SnAKe to find better Pareto front approximations at lower cost than existing methods. Overall, the extensions equip SnAKe with more flexibility to handle common real-world considerations of unknown budget needs, input safety limits, and multiple objectives. This enables the algorithm to be deployed more effectively for practical applications like materials science, drug design, and chemical engineering.
