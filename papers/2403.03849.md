# [MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Medical image classification is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis but faces challenges. CNNs lack long-range modeling while Transformers have quadratic complexity. There is a need for an architecture that can capture both local features and long-range dependencies efficiently.  

- No prior work has explored state space models (SSMs), which have inherent advantages, for medical image classification.

Solution:
- The paper proposes MedMamba, the first SSM-based model tailored for medical image classification. 

- MedMamba contains a novel Conv-SSM module combining CNNs and modern SSM called Mamba. This hybrid module leverages CNNs' local modeling and SSM's global modeling and linear complexity.

- MedMamba first embeds the input image into patches, then processes them through multiple Conv-SSM modules in different stages, finally classifying the image.

Contributions:
- Proposes MedMamba as the first SSM-based medical image classification model, establishing a new baseline.

- Designs a Conv-SSM module that synergizes CNNs and SSM to capture both local and global features efficiently.  

- Conducts extensive experiments on 3 public and 2 private medical image datasets spanning different modalities (endoscopy, ultrasound, x-ray).

- Achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art models, demonstrating the potential of SSM for medical image analysis.

- Provides valuable insights into developing more efficient SSM-based AI systems for healthcare.

In summary, the paper pioneers SSM for medical classification, proposes MedMamba using a hybrid Conv-SSM module, and shows its effectiveness across diverse medical imaging datasets.
