# [Relax Image-Specific Prompt Requirement in SAM: A Single Generic Prompt   for Segmenting Camouflaged Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07374)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GenSAM, a novel approach for weakly-supervised camouflaged object detection (WSCOD) that eliminates the need for image-specific manual prompts. GenSAM takes only a generic textual description of the task as input (e.g. "segment the camouflaged animal") and automatically generates visual prompts tailored to each test image to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The key innovation is the Cross-modal Chains of Thought Prompting (CCTP) module, which leverages vision-language models to reason about the visual concepts present in the image corresponding to the textual description. Multiple parallel chains of prompting are used to derive a consensus on the regions of interest. The resulting heatmaps serve as visual prompts to focus SAM's attention. Additionally, a Progressive Mask Generation (PMG) process iteratively reweights the input image to further refine the prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner at test time without modification to SAM's parameters. Experiments on three COD benchmarks demonstrate GenSAM matches or exceeds the performance of approaches relying on scribble/point supervision for each image. The ability to produce accurate segmentation from a single generic prompt exhibits strong generalization and practical application potential.
