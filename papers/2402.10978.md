# [Language Models with Conformal Factuality Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate non-factual and hallucinated content, making their outputs untrustworthy. However, precisely quantifying and controlling the factuality of LLM outputs is challenging. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes "conformal factuality", which connects ideas from conformal prediction to provide high-probability correctness guarantees on LLM outputs. The key insight is that the correctness of an LLM output can be framed as an uncertainty quantification problem, where the uncertainty set is defined as the statements entailed by the LLM output. Using this connection, conformal methods can provide guarantees by implicitly representing uncertainty sets and backing off the specificity of claims.

The paper gives an algorithmic instantiation by:
(1) Breaking down LLM outputs into sub-claims 
(2) Scoring sub-claims by uncertainty  
(3) Removing low-scoring sub-claims to give guarantees

This algorithm leads to an interpretable system where users can still understand the remaining factual claims.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes connection between conformal prediction and LLM factuality using entailment
- Gives algorithm for conformal factuality by scoring and removing sub-claims  
- Empirically demonstrates high-probability factuality guarantees on LLM outputs while retaining most sub-claims

The method applies to any LLM, requires few human annotations, and leads to usable systems with quantitative correctness guarantees significantly higher than base LM performance. Evaluations on QA and reasoning datasets validate these claims.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes conformal factuality, a method that uses conformal prediction to provide high probability correctness guarantees on language model outputs by implicitly defining uncertainty sets via entailment relations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called "conformal factuality" that provides high probability correctness guarantees for language model outputs. Specifically:

- The paper develops a connection between language modeling and conformal prediction. It shows that correctness of a language model output is equivalent to an uncertainty quantification problem, where the uncertainty sets are defined by the entailments of the output. 

- Using this connection, the paper shows that conformal prediction corresponds to a back-off algorithm for language models that progressively makes outputs less specific (expanding uncertainty sets) in order to provide high probability correctness guarantees. 

- The paper provides an algorithm instantiation using sub-claims, which breaks down outputs and scores/removes sub-claims based on uncertainty. This results in modified outputs with correctness guarantees.

- Experiments on closed book QA and reasoning tasks demonstrate that this approach can provide 80-90% correctness guarantees for GPT-4 while retaining most of the original output.

So in summary, the main contribution is establishing a connection between conformal prediction and language models to enable high probability correctness guarantees on outputs, along with an algorithmic framework and experiments demonstrating its efficacy.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Language models - The paper discusses improving the factuality and correctness guarantees of language models.

- Conformal prediction - The paper proposes using techniques from conformal prediction to provide probabilistic guarantees about the factuality of language model outputs. 

- Uncertainty quantification - Conformal prediction is framed in the paper as a way to perform uncertainty quantification for language models.

- Entailment relations - The correctness of a language model output is formalized in terms of entailment relations to some reference text or knowledge. 

- Backoff algorithms - The conformal prediction framework corresponds to a backoff algorithm that makes language model outputs progressively less specific to provide correctness guarantees.

- Sub-claims - The method is implemented by identifying and scoring sub-claims in language model outputs. Sub-claims with low scores are removed to improve factuality.

- Factuality evaluation - Experiments demonstrate the approach on closed-book QA and reasoning tasks and evaluate both factuality guarantees and output utility.

So in summary, key terms cover language models, conformal prediction, uncertainty quantification, entailment, backoff algorithms, sub-claims, and factuality evaluation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the conformal factuality method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed method connect language modeling to conformal prediction? What is the key insight that enables this connection?

2. Explain the correspondence made between correctness of a language model output and the coverage property in conformal prediction. How does defining uncertainty sets via entailment relations make this practical? 

3. The paper breaks down language model outputs into sub-claims for scoring. What are the benefits of evaluating and removing sub-claims compared to evaluating complete output sequences?

4. What theoretical guarantee does the paper provide on the factuality of outputs from the proposed conformal factuality algorithm? Explain the lower and upper bounds. 

5. What different sub-claim scoring functions are proposed and evaluated? Which one seems most promising and why? How do the ranking-based scoring functions differ?

6. How is the method adapted to provide guarantees on partial correctness of outputs instead of fully factual outputs? What changes were made to the scoring function and resulting guarantee?

7. The conformal guarantee applies over a prespecified distribution P. What limitations does this introduce when applying the method in practice where distributions may change?

8. What prompts were designed to implement the key components of sub-claim separation and merging functions? How crucial are these to the overall performance?

9. The empirical results show the method can substantially increase factuality of outputs. But what other metrics need to be tracked to ensure overall utility is retained?

10. What opportunities exist to build on this approach, either by using more advanced conformal prediction techniques or by integrating better uncertainty quantification methods for language models?
