# [Object-Oriented Semantic Mapping for Reliable UAVs Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08132)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments is challenging. UAVs need comprehensive maps containing both geometric and semantic information to ensure safe navigation and obstacle avoidance. However, prevalent metric maps often lack crucial semantic details. Though some prior works have developed 3D semantic mapping, they are computationally heavy and unsuitable for UAVs.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a system to construct a 2D probabilistic metric map enriched with object semantic information extracted from RGB-D images. The key components are:

1) YOLOv8-based object detection on RGB images 
2) BoT-SORT for consistent object tracking
3) Point cloud preprocessing using clustering to remove outliers  
4) 2D SLAM (CartoGrapher) for metric mapping and localization
5) A novel association method to calculate object positions and project semantic information onto the map
6) Enriching the metric map by incorporating semantic attributes and probabilities in a grid-based representation 

Main Contributions:

1) A complete pipeline for semantic mapping that combines object detection, tracking, metric mapping and novel association for precise object positioning.

2) Effective mapping of hollow bottom objects like chairs through point cloud processing and RANSAC-based projection. This enables safe navigation around such objects.

3) Evaluation on a UAV platform shows the ability to construct semantic maps with various objects in real-time using an embedded computer. This demonstrates practical utility.

4) The probabilistic representation provides richer semantics and uncertainties compared to regular metric maps, empowering informed navigation decisions.

In summary, the proposed semantic mapping system significantly advances real-world scene understanding and reliable autonomous navigation capabilities for UAVs in complex environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a system to construct a probabilistic metric map enriched with object semantic information extracted from RGB-D images to enable reliable autonomous navigation for UAVs in complex environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a system to construct a probabilistic metric map enriched with object information extracted from RGB-D images to enable reliable navigation and obstacle avoidance for UAVs. Specifically, the key contributions highlighted in the paper are:

1) A semantic SLAM system that combines localization and metric mapping from CartoGrapher with object detection using YOLOv8 and tracking using BoT-SORT to obtain semantic scene understanding abilities. 

2) A method to extract 3D point clouds of detected objects, associate them with poses on the map, and project them onto the 2D map to determine object positions and sizes. This allows mapping of hollow bottom objects like chairs and tables.

3) Enriching the metric map with a probabilistic representation that incorporates semantics by assigning occupancy probabilities to each grid cell based on likelihood of object classes. This representation enhances navigation capabilities.

4) Demonstrating the efficiency and real-time performance of the system by implementation on an embedded Jetson AGX Xavier unit, showing its applicability for UAVs in complex real-world environments.

In summary, the main contribution is an object-oriented semantic mapping system that fuses metric maps from SLAM with object semantics to enable more reliable autonomous UAV navigation in cluttered environments.
