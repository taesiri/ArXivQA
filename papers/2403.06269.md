# [FastVideoEdit: Leveraging Consistency Models for Efficient Text-to-Video   Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "FastVideoEdit: Leveraging Consistency Models for Efficient Text-to-Video Editing":

Problem: 
Existing video editing methods that rely on diffusion models suffer from long computational times. This is due to the sequential sampling strategy in diffusion models and additional steps needed in these methods such as time-consuming inversion or extraction of conditional constraints. This makes real-time video editing applications impractical.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FastVideoEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing approach inspired by Consistency Models (CMs). By leveraging the self-consistency property of CMs, the need for inversion or additional condition extraction is eliminated, significantly reducing editing time. A special variance schedule facilitates direct mapping from source to target video instead of adding/denoising noise. Fewer sampling steps can be used while maintaining quality due to CMs' content preservation capability, further improving speed.

Key Contributions:
- First video editing method to eliminate the need for inversion or additional condition extraction by leveraging consistency models
- Special variance schedule enables direct source to target mapping, transforming editing from adding/denoising noise
- Fewer sampling steps used while maintaining quality due to CMs' content preservation ability 
- State-of-the-art performance in terms of editing quality and speed - significantly faster editing than previous methods
- Maintains background integrity via proposed latent replacement technique
- Enhances consistency using batch consistency sampling and TokenFlow propagation

In summary, FastVideoEdit achieves highly efficient, high-quality and consistent text-guided video editing by effectively utilizing consistency models. It eliminates time-consuming steps needed in other diffusion-based methods and sets a new state-of-the-art in terms of editing speed and quality.
