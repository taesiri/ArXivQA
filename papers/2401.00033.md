# [Hybrid Modeling Design Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Hybrid Modeling Design Patterns":

Problem:
- Hybrid modeling combines first-principles models based on domain knowledge with data-driven models. It can overcome limitations of using either approach on its own. 
- However, there are many ways to combine these approaches and picking the right one depends on the problem. 
- There is a need for reusable and generalized hybrid modeling solutions that abstract away domain-specific details.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce design patterns as modular, reusable blueprints for solving recurring hybrid modeling challenges. 
- Present four base patterns:
   1) Delta model: Additively combine first-principles and data-driven models
   2) Physics-based preprocessing: Transform inputs using domain knowledge before feeding into data-driven model
   3) Feature learning: Learn hard-to-measure inputs with data-driven model to feed into first-principles model
   4) Physical constraints: Incorporate domain knowledge to inform data-driven model architecture
- Also provide two composition patterns:
   1) Recurrent composition: Update internal state sequentially, often for sequential data
   2) Hierarchical composition: Hybrid models themselves serve as building blocks for more complex hybrid models

Main Contributions:
- Formalize hybrid modeling solutions into design patterns to facilitate knowledge sharing across domains
- Introduce notation, terminology, examples and block diagrams to communicate these patterns
- Showcase diverse applications including climate modeling, physics, engineering, etc.
- Provide modular building blocks that can be adapted and combined to create custom hybrid modeling solutions
- Allow standardized development of techniques while retaining flexibility for innovation
- Identify common challenges to guide future hybrid modeling research

In summary, the paper introduces design patterns as an impactful abstraction tool to organize and advance hybrid modeling across domains. The patterns distill domain knowledge into reusable blueprints to systematically construct hybrid models.
