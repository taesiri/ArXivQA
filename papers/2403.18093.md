# [Enhancing Legal Document Retrieval: A Multi-Phase Approach with Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18093)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Legal information retrieval is challenging due to the large number and substantial length of legal articles. Directly applying prompting techniques to large language models (LLMs) is difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a 3-phase retrieval pipeline to support prompting of LLMs:
    1. BM25 Pre-ranking for fast initial retrieval
    2. BERT-based Re-ranking for semantic similarity
    3. Prompting-based Re-ranking to leverage reasoning of LLMs  
- Use an adaptive sliding window method to fit long text into LLM token limits
- Ensemble relevance scores from BERT and LLMs to combine strengths

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrated that incorporating prompting of LLMs as the final phase of a retrieval pipeline boosts accuracy, with the F2 score improving from 0.5268 to 0.8085 on the COLIEE 2023 testing set
- Adaptive sliding window prompting allows full legal text to be input to LLMs
- Ensembling relevance scores of BERT and LLMs improves robustness 
- Error analysis revealed limitations in handling complex queries and limitations of early pipeline phases

In summary, the paper proposes a novel 3-phase retrieval pipeline to effectively utilize prompting techniques on large language models for legal document retrieval. Experiments show substantial gains in accuracy. The analysis also discusses areas for future improvement to address limitations.
