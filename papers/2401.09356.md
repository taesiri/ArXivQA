# [Swing: Short-cutting Rings for Higher Bandwidth Allreduce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The allreduce collective operation is used extensively in distributed machine learning training and high performance computing applications. It accounts for a significant fraction of job runtimes. On networks like torus that do not provide full bisection bandwidth, the performance of allreduce depends on the distance between communicating nodes - higher distances imply more contention on shared links. Torus networks are widely used in ML accelerators like Google's TPUs and supercomputer networks, so improving allreduce performance on torus networks is important. 

Existing allreduce algorithms have deficiencies in latency, bandwidth or congestion that limit their performance across different message sizes on torus networks. Algorithms optimized for small messages underperform at large sizes and vice versa. Adaptive solutions based on linear programming have high overhead. There is a need for an allreduce algorithm that provides consistent high performance across message sizes on torus networks.

Proposed Solution - The Swing Algorithm:
The paper proposes Swing, a new allreduce algorithm optimized for torus networks. It has the following key properties:

- Logarithmic number of steps for low latency deficiency similar to recursive doubling
- Minimizes bytes transmitted for low bandwidth deficiency  
- Communicates with lower distance peers each step to reduce congestion deficiency
- Adapts communication pattern to "swing" between dimensions 

This is achieved by defining apeer selection function that shortcuts dimensions to pick lower distance peers. Formal proofs of correctness are provided. Swing is extended to use multiple ports to minimize deficiencies further. The modeling and analysis of deficiencies provides insights into optimizing collective algorithms.

Main Contributions:
- Modeling and analysis to quantify latency, bandwidth and congestion deficiencies of allreduce algorithms
- Design of Swing allreduce algorithm with provably lower deficiencies 
- Extensive evaluation showing Swing outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 3x on torus networks, across vector sizes from 32B to 128MiB

The key innovation is the algorithm design that reduces congestion by picking lower distance peers on each step, while retaining logarithmic steps and optimal bandwidth. This provides consistent and high performance across message sizes on torus networks regardless of shape, size or number of dimensions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Swing, a new allreduce algorithm for torus networks that reduces the distance between communicating nodes compared to prior algorithms, improving performance by up to 3x for small and medium sized vectors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new allreduce algorithm called "Swing" that is optimized for torus and torus-like networks. Specifically:

- Swing performs a logarithmic number of steps and transmits a minimal number of bytes like other allreduce algorithms, but it reduces the distance between communicating nodes compared to prior algorithms. This helps reduce congestion on torus networks that don't have full bisection bandwidth.

- The paper analyzes and models the latency, bandwidth, and congestion deficiencies of Swing and other state-of-the-art allreduce algorithms on multidimensional torus networks. This highlights the limitations of existing algorithms.

- The paper presents the Swing algorithm design for 1D and multidimensional torus networks, including techniques to use all available ports and optimize for non-square tori.

- Extensive evaluations compare Swing against other allreduce algorithms on various torus and torus-like topologies. The results show Swing outperforms the best existing algorithms for practical allreduce sizes from 32B to 128MiB, with improvements up to 3x faster.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the Swing allreduce algorithm that provides superior performance on torus networks compared to prior state-of-the-art solutions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the Swing allreduce algorithm proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims Swing has lower congestion deficiency compared to recursive doubling. Can you elaborate on the intuition behind why this is the case? How exactly does Swing reduce the distance between communicating nodes?

2. In the modeling of collective communication, what is the difference between algorithmic bandwidth deficiency and congestion bandwidth deficiency? Why is congestion deficiency particularly relevant for topologies like torus? 

3. The paper evaluates Swing extensively on square and rectangular tori. What is the expected performance trend of Swing as the aspect ratio of the rectangular torus increases? Can you analytically estimate the congestion deficiency?

4. How does Swing extend communication from 1D to higher dimensional tori? Walk through the example of executing Swing on a 3D torus - which nodes communicate at each step? 

5. When evaluating Swing on Hamming mesh and HyperX topologies, what causes the reduction in congestion deficiency compared to a regular torus? How does adding extra links help Swing?

6. What customizations need to be made to Swing when the number of nodes is not a power of 2? Does this affect the modeling of algorithm deficiencies?  

7. The paper claims Swing can be used for reduce-scatter and allgather collectives. Can the basic idea be extended to other collective communication patterns like broadcast, reduce, etc.?

8. How does the use of non-minimal, adaptive routing impact the performance of Swing? Under what conditions will it help or hurt performance?  

9. What hardware/network capabilities could further optimize Swing's performance? For example, would in-network aggregation help and how?

10. What changes would need to be made to Swing to work on networks with dragonfly or Slim Fly topologies? How do the congestion deficiencies compare?
