# [Transforming and Combining Rewards for Aligning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies two important problems that arise when aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences using a two-stage process: (1) learning a reward model from preference data, and (2) using the reward to update the LLM. 

The first problem is that any monotone transformation of the learned reward preserves preference rankings, so there is no single "correct" choice. Is there a transformation that is better than using the raw rewards for alignment?

The second problem is that we often want to align LLMs to multiple desirable properties (e.g. helpfulness AND harmlessness). If we have separate reward models for each property, how should we best aggregate them for alignment?

Proposed Solution:
1) For rewards learned from Bradley-Terry preference models, the paper shows that transforming rewards using:
   u(x,y) = log Ïƒ(r(x,y) - r^ref(x))
   is a principled choice. Here r^ref(x) is a reference reward level for prompt x.
   
2) Under an "independent judgements" assumption, the paper proves that summing the transformed rewards corresponds to logical AND. So this enables aligning to multiple properties.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies issues with using raw rewards: spurious large gains, underfitting
- Derives log-sigmoid transformation of centered rewards based on probabilistic interpretation 
- Shows transformation emphasizes improving low-scoring outputs 
- Summation of transformed rewards aligns to logical AND of properties
- Experiments show substantial gains over raw rewards in helpful & harmless alignment

In summary, the key insight is that the transformation and summation provide a theoretically-motivated way to improve multi-objective alignment in the two-stage preference learning approach. Experiments validate that this method significantly outperforms the standard practice of using raw reward.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies how to best transform and aggregate rewards from human preference data in order to effectively align large language models to desired attributes like helpfulness and harmlessness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes using a log-sigmoid transformation of the Bradley-Terry rewards in the typical RLHF pipeline for aligning large language models. This transformation has benefits such as emphasizing improvement of lower-scoring outputs and mitigating reward hacking.

2) It shows that by using this transformed reward, a simple summation corresponds to a logical AND when combining multiple reward models. This allows principled aggregation of rewards to align models to satisfy multiple properties.

3) Through experiments on aligning models to be helpful and harmless, it demonstrates that using the proposed transformed rewards and summation aggregation leads to substantially improved alignment performance compared to standard practices. For example, Figure 1 shows much better tradeoffs between alignment strength and external helpfulness+harmlessness evaluations.

In summary, the key ideas are the log-sigmoid reward transformation and how it enables both better single task alignment and multi-task alignment through simple summation. Experiments verify that these ideas translate to better aligned language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Reward transformation - Transforming the learned reward function to mitigate issues like reward hacking and underfitting in alignment. The paper proposes using a log-sigmoid transformation.

- Reward aggregation - Combining multiple reward models corresponding to different desirable properties like helpfulness and harmlessness. The paper shows that summing the transformed rewards corresponds to a logical AND.

- Alignment - Updating language models to bias their outputs towards having certain desirable properties based on learned reward models.

- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) - Using human preference data to learn a reward model, and using reinforcement learning to maximize the expected reward.

- Bradley-Terry model - A commonly used model to learn scalar rewards from pairwise preference data.

- Probabilistic interpretation - Formalizing the alignment goal as sampling from a distribution conditional on the output being "good". This provides principles for choosing reward transformations and aggregations.

- Reference reward - A parameter of the proposed transformation that acts as a threshold for what is considered a "good" response.

- Underfitting and reward hacking - Two problems mitigated by the proposed reward transformation - failing to improve some prompts, and exploiting inaccuracies in the reward model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes transforming the learned Bradley-Terry rewards before using them to align the language model. What is the intuition behind why the log-sigmoid transformation is appropriate here? How does it mechanistically change the effect of the alignment?

2. The choice of reference reward $r^{\text{ref}}(x)$ acts as a hyperparameter for the transformation. What considerations should go into setting this for a particular property we want the language model to satisfy? How does varying it change the effect of alignment?

3. The paper claims the transformed reward mitigates both underfitting and reward hacking. Can you clearly explain the mechanisms behind each of these effects? Provide illustrative examples.  

4. The assumption that human judgements on whether a response satisfies different properties are independent seems central to justify using summation of transformed rewards for multi-property alignment. When might this assumption be violated? How could it be validated?

5. The experiments focus on helpfulness and harmlessness. How difficult would it be to extend the methodology to aligning other properties like factuality or creativity? What new challenges might arise?

6. The preference data used trains the reward model comes from comparisons between AI responses. How robust is the method likely to be if the training data comes from human-AI comparisons instead? 

7. The paper considers RLHF and best-of-k for alignment. How else could the transformed rewards be used? Do you expect similar benefits to accrued in other alignment strategies?

8. The log-sigmoid transformation is derived specifically for Bradley-Terry. How could you derive an appropriate transformation if the rewards were learned using cross-entropy or other proper scoring rules?

9. The choice of evaluator model likely impacts measured performance. To what extent do you expect the relative benefits of reward transformation to hold for other choices of evaluator?

10. The paper focuses on helpfulness and harmlessness. What other key properties would you be interested to see this method applied to in future work? What new challenges or benefits might arise?
