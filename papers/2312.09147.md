# [Triplane Meets Gaussian Splatting: Fast and Generalizable Single-View 3D   Reconstruction with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09147)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Triplane-Gaussian (TGS), a new framework for fast, high-quality 3D reconstruction from a single image. TGS employs a hybrid 3D representation combining an explicit point cloud that outlines object geometry with an implicit triplane field that refines geometry and encodes 3D Gaussian radiance properties. Two transformer networks reconstruct the point cloud and triplane field respectively from image features. To improve consistency with the input image, projection-aware conditioning integrates local image features during point cloud upsampling and 3D Gaussian decoding. Additionally, geometry-aware encoding aligns the reconstructed point cloud with the implicit triplane field. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for both geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis on the GSO dataset. Unlike prior work requiring slow optimization, TGS performs feed-forward inference, enabling reconstruction in seconds. The hybrid representation strikes an effective balance - faster rendering than implicit-only methods while achieving better quality than explicit-only approaches. Overall, TGS opens new possibilities for fast, high-quality single-view 3D content creation leveraging the advantages of transformer architectures and Gaussian splatting techniques.
