# [Joint Conditional Diffusion Model for Image Restoration with Mixed   Degradations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image restoration in adverse weather conditions is challenging, especially when multiple degradations occur simultaneously. Existing methods either focus on removing a single type of degradation or require explicit identification/separation of individual components in the degraded image. However, this is difficult and less effective for handling complex real-world scenarios with mixed degradations. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a diffusion-based blind image restoration method to handle mixed weather degradations effectively, without needing to explicitly decompose them. The key ideas are:

1) A mixed weather degradation model is built by incorporating principles of atmospheric scattering to handle combinations of rain, snow, haze etc.

2) A Joint Conditional Diffusion Model (JCDM) is designed, which takes both the degraded image and predicted degradation mask as conditions to guide the restoration process. This provides better conditioning to focus on corrupted regions.

3) A refinement network with Uncertainty Estimation Blocks (UEB) is used to further enhance image quality and reduce uncertainty.

Main Contributions:

- Construction of a flexible mixed weather degradation model based on physical principles
- Novel conditional diffusion scheme leveraging degraded image and predicted mask for targeted restoration 
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in removing mixed degradations as well as specific weather types like rain, haze and snow
- Faster inference than prior diffusion models while maintaining competitive restoration quality

The method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared to existing task-specific, multi-task, and blind restoration techniques when evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets containing diverse degradations.
