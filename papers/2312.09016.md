# [Symmetry Breaking and Equivariant Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09016)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes an important limitation of equivariant neural networks: their inability to break symmetry at the level of individual data samples. The authors argue that while exploiting symmetry as an inductive bias is useful, many learning tasks like modeling phase transitions in physics require symmetry breaking. They formally characterize this limitation by showing equivariant functions must preserve the symmetry of inputs. To address this, they introduce a relaxation called "relaxed equivariance" which allows mapping symmetric inputs to asymmetric outputs. They further demonstrate how to build relaxed equivariant multilayer perceptrons that can break symmetry through constraints on the weight matrices. Potential applications where symmetry breaking is relevant include physics, graph representation learning, combinatorial optimization, and decoding from invariant representations. Overall, this paper identifies an under-explored aspect of exploiting symmetry in deep learning and proposes both theory and methods for symmetry breaking when learning equivariant models.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Equivariant neural networks have limitations in handling symmetry breaking, which is the transition from a symmetric state to an asymmetric state. This occurs in physical phase transitions but also more generally when we want to model transitions that break symmetries.
- Equivariant functions, by their definition, preserve symmetries of inputs based on "Curie's principle". This makes them unable to model transitions that break symmetry.
- Getting rid of equivariance altogether is unsatisfactory as we still want to account for symmetries in the underlying distributions. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a relaxation of equivariance called "relaxed equivariance" that allows breaking symmetry while still partially accounting for it. 
- Relaxed equivariance requires the output to be predictable upon transformation of the input, up to meaningless stabilizing transformations. This allows symmetry breaking.
- Derive relaxed equivariance from first principles in supervised learning settings with symmetric distributions. It naturally arises when modeling deterministic models instead of full distributions.
- Construct multilayer perceptrons that satisfy relaxed equivariance instead of standard equivariance by constraining the linear layers appropriately. 

Main Contributions:
- Formal analysis of the limitations of equivariant neural networks in handling symmetry breaking
- Introduction of the notion of relaxed equivariance as a principled way to circumvent these limitations
- Derivation of relaxed equivariance from statistical learning principles
- Method to build relaxed equivariant multilayer perceptrons
- Discussion of the relevance of symmetry breaking in physics, graph learning, combinatorial optimization, equivariant decoding.

In summary, the paper offers a theoretical grounding for symmetry breaking in deep learning and proposes the notion of relaxed equivariance to handle it in a principled manner.
