# [An Adaptive Placement and Parallelism Framework for Accelerating RLHF   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Training large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) involves managing multiple models (actor, critic, etc.), which is complex.  
- Existing approaches use a simple "flattening" strategy to place all models on all devices, but this causes bottlenecks, redundancy, and efficiency issues.

Proposed Solution:
- An "Adaptive Placement and Parallelism (APP)" framework with two new strategies:
  1) Interleaving: Places some models (e.g. reference and reward) on separate groups of devices to reduce redundancy and communication costs.  
  2) Separation: Separates training and generation (inference) models onto different devices to optimize each stage differently.

- Also provides an easy-to-use APP Execution Engine interface to simplify distributed RLHF training for users.

- Adaptive Parallel Planner automatically configures model placement and hyperparameters.

Key Contributions:
1) Flexible model placement strategies tailored for different training scenarios and scales.
2) Compatibility with other acceleration techniques and easy to use.  
3) Supports heterogeneous devices by separating training and inference.
4) Significantly improves efficiency - up to 11x speedup compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the paper introduces an adaptive framework to efficiently manage the complex training of multiple models in RLHF by carefully placing models across devices. This provides major improvements in throughput, memory utilization and usability over existing strategies.
