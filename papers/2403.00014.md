# [GIN-SD: Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional   Encoding and Attentive Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Rumor source detection is important to limit the spread of misinformation. Prior works rely on having complete user data, but in practice such data is often incomplete due to time, resource, and privacy constraints.  
- Detecting sources from graphs with incomplete nodes poses three key challenges: (1) Missing data from incomplete nodes can be erroneously treated as valid; (2) Information spread varies across nodes, so uniform treatment hinders efficiency; (3) Imbalance between few source nodes and many non-source nodes leads the model to overlook sources.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose GIN-SD, a novel framework for source detection in graphs with incomplete nodes, using positional encoding and attentive fusion.

- A positional embedding module distinguishes incomplete nodes by encoding node positions, states and propagation features.  

- An attentive fusion module focuses on influential nodes via a self-attention mechanism with class-dependent weights.

- A class balancing loss weights the source and non-source sets differently to handle class imbalance.

Key Contributions:
- First formulation of the problem of rumor source detection with incomplete user data.

- Novel GIN-SD framework to address this using positional encoding and attentive fusion.

- Positional encoding to distinguish incomplete nodes. 

- Self-attention to focus on influential nodes.

- Class balancing loss to handle imbalance between source and non-source nodes.

- Extensive experiments showing GIN-SD outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods across 8 datasets. Demonstrates effectiveness and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel framework called GIN-SD for rumor source detection in graphs with incomplete nodes, which utilizes positional encoding and attentive fusion mechanisms to distinguish incomplete nodes and focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is summarized as follows:

1. They are the first to formulate the rumor sources detection problem under incomplete user data and propose a novel approach to address this issue. 

2. They devise a source detection method for rumors under incomplete user data via positional encoding and attentive fusion mechanism. The key ideas include:
(a) Distinguishing incomplete nodes by exploiting position-based encoding of user features. 
(b) Adaptively allocating attention coefficients using a self-attention mechanism based on nodes' information transmission capacity.
(c) Introducing a class balancing mechanism to mitigate prediction bias.

3. They show by experiments that the proposed approach demonstrates superiority in the context of incomplete user data, comparing to baseline methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new GIN-SD framework to address the novel problem of rumor source detection with incomplete user data, which has not been studied previously. The core of the solution involves positional encoding, attentive fusion and class balancing. Experiments verify the effectiveness of GIN-SD, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
