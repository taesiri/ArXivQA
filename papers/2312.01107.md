# [Rapid Speaker Adaptation in Low Resource Text to Speech Systems using   Synthetic Data and Transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Building high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically requires large amounts of high-quality studio recordings (10-20 hrs) which is expensive. 
- Rapid adaptation of TTS systems to new speakers is also challenging, especially in low-resource scenarios with limited target speaker data.

Proposed Solution:
- Use transfer learning from high-resource English TTS system to low-resource Indian language Hindi TTS system.
- Further augment training data using synthetic Hindi speech generated from an existing Hindi TTS system.
- Employ a 3-step training strategy:
  1) Pre-train Tacotron2 (text-to-spectrogram) model on English data
  2) Retrain whole model on synthetic Hindi data 
  3) Fine-tune only the decoder on target Hindi speaker data (3 hrs)
- Freeze encoder weights in step 3 since it's already well-trained on large target domain text data.

Main Contributions:
- Show that transfer learning from English and synthetic Hindi enables building good TTS with just 3 hrs of target Hindi data.
- Propose an effective 3-step transfer learning strategy utilizing available English and Hindi TTS systems. 
- Demonstrate that fine-tuning only the decoder works better than full fine-tuning in the last step.
- Evaluate models thoroughly on unseen domain and show that 3 hrs training data is enough for production-ready TTS.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed 3-step transfer learning approach to rapidly adapt TTS systems to new speakers in extremely low-resource scenarios. Both cross-lingual transfer and synthetic data augmentation are leveraged effectively.
