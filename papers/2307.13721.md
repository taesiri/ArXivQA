# [Foundational Models Defining a New Era in Vision: A Survey and Outlook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13721)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

From my reading, this paper does not seem to have a single central research question or hypothesis. Instead, it provides a broad survey and review of recent progress on foundational models in computer vision. The key goals and contributions of the paper appear to be:- Provide a systematic categorization and taxonomy of different types of foundational models in computer vision, including textually prompted models, visually prompted models, and models based on heterogeneous modalities.- Review and summarize a wide range of recent works on foundational models across different application areas, including image classification, visual grounding, segmentation, conversational agents, robotics, etc.- Analyze the architectures, training objectives, datasets, prompting mechanisms, and capabilities of different foundational model families. - Discuss the advantages of foundational models like generalization, adaptability, and scalability compared to specialized narrow AI models.- Highlight open challenges and future research directions for foundational models such as improvements in alignment, contextual understanding, robustness, data efficiency, and interpretability.So in summary, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging field of foundational models in computer vision, categorize the different approaches, summarize key works, and discuss open problems and opportunities - rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The central motivation seems to be to understand this rapidly developing research area and identify promising future research directions.
