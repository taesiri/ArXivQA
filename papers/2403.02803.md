# [Towards Robust Federated Learning via Logits Calibration on Non-IID Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning approach that enables collaborative model training across edge devices without sharing raw private data. However, FL faces two key challenges: 1) vulnerability to adversarial attacks where imperceptible perturbations can fool models; and 2) non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data distribution across devices causing performance degradation. Therefore, enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks for non-IID data in FL is necessary.

Proposed Solution - Federated Adversarial Logits Calibration (FedALC):
The paper proposes an adversarial training (AT) framework called FedALC to improve robustness against adversarial attacks in non-IID FL settings. The key ideas are:

1) Perform AT locally on each device to improve global model robustness against adversarial examples. This is termed federated adversarial training (FAT).

2) Mitigate non-IID issue by a simple logits calibration technique. Within each local batch, count frequency of classes and use square root of inverse frequency to weigh logits for each class. This balances learning between frequent and rare classes.

3) New local loss function combines AT and logits calibration to handle both robustness and non-IID issues. Global model aggregates local updates from devices.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposed FedALC framework to enhance robustness of FL against adversarial attacks under data heterogeneity. 

2) A logits calibration method to weigh logits based on inverse class frequency to mitigate impact of non-IID data.

3) Evaluated FedALC on MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10. Results show improved natural and robust accuracy over baselines demonstrating effectiveness.

In summary, the paper makes noteworthy contributions on an important problem by presenting a practical federated adversarial training approach integrated with a simple but effective logits calibration technique to handle key challenges for secure and robust FL.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning framework called FedALC that calibrates the logits outputs to address class imbalance and incorporates adversarial training to improve model robustness and accuracy under non-IID data distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces a simple yet effective federated learning framework called FedALC that improves natural and robust accuracy under non-IID data settings. 

2. It proposes a logits calibration method to balance the learning of the model for non-IID data distributions. Specifically, in each batch, the logit value of each class is multiplied by the square root of its corresponding inverse frequency. 

3. It conducts extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets - MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results show that the proposed FedALC method achieves significant performance gains over baselines in terms of both natural accuracy and robust accuracy against adversarial attacks in most cases.

In summary, the key contribution is a calibrated adversarial training strategy for federated learning that enhances model robustness and performance under non-IID data distributions across clients.
