# [End-to-end solution for linked open data query logs analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Linked Open Data (LOD) query logs contain valuable information about user interests and behavior. However, directly exploiting these logs is challenging due to their complex structure and trust issues related to quality and provenance. 
- There is a lack of end-to-end solutions that provide both curation of LOD logs and analytical capabilities for knowledge extraction.

Proposed Solution:
- A 4-layered architecture for LOD log analytics:
   1. Raw Log Layer: Storage of original log files
   2. Preparation & Curation Layer: Extracts needed data, profiles logs, cleans/transforms logs, annotates trust
   3. Storage Layer: Stores curated logs 
   4. Analytics Layer: Provides analytics capabilities and visualizations
- The architecture considers trust throughout each layer in terms of quality and provenance. Specific operators are used to clean, correct, and filter untrusted log entries.

Main Contributions:  
- Clearly defines the ecosystem and components of LOD query logs
- Provides an end-to-end solution from raw logs to analytical usage with trust as a central concern
- Validation via experiments on real-world LOD logs from the scholarly domain
- Demonstrates the utility of the architecture by using curated logs to generate a trusted data warehouse model
 
In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive layered architecture to enable knowledge discovery from LOD query logs. By addressing quality, provenance, and analytical aspects, it allows generating trusted analytics from these complex log datasets.
