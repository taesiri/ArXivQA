# [Weak Distribution Detectors Lead to Stronger Generalizability of   Vision-Language Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00603)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision-language prompt tuning (VLPT) methods like CoOp, CoCoOp, ProGrad, etc. have poor generalization ability from base classes to novel classes. They tend to overfit on base classes and perform poorly on novel classes. 

- There is a trade-off between accuracy on base classes and novel classes. For example, CoOp has the best accuracy on base classes but worst on novel classes. In contrast, CLIP has good novel class accuracy but poor base class accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new viewpoint to address the base-novel tradeoff by converting it to an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. The key idea is to predict whether a sample is from the base distribution or novel distribution.

- Use OOD detection methods like maximum softmax probability (MSP), maximum logit, energy score and entropy score to get an in-distribution score for an input sample based on both the zero-shot CLIP classifier and few-shot prompt tuned classifier.

- Propose a competition based scoring function to get a score between 0-1 indicating whether the sample is more likely from base or novel distribution. This score is used to dynamically fuse the zero-shot and few-shot classifiers.

- The fused classifier relies more on zero-shot CLIP for novel samples and more on prompt tuned classifier for base samples, thereby improving generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a new viewpoint to convert the base-novel tradeoff problem in VLPT to an OOD detection problem.

- Propose a competition based scoring function for fusing zero-shot and few-shot classifiers dynamically using outputs of OOD detectors.

- Show even weak OOD detectors can improve generalization ability of existing VLPT methods like CoOp, CoCoOp and ProGrad. The proposed method gets consistent improvements in base-to-novel setting across 11 recognition datasets.
