# [Pre-Trained Language Models Represent Some Geographic Populations Better   Than Others](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper investigates whether pre-trained language models (LLMs) such as BigScience's BLOOM and Facebook's OPT provide equal representations across diverse geographic populations when using the same language (English) and register (social media).  
- Specifically, the paper examines if there is a "population skew" in these models, whereby some populations are much better represented than others. 

Methods:
- The authors collect a geo-referenced corpus of 86,186 comparable English sub-corpora from social media, representing 927 local populations across 130 countries. 
- Using perplexity as a measure of model fit, the paper probes different sized BLOOM and OPT models on this corpus to assess whether perplexities are consistent across corpora from different local populations.

Key Findings:
- Both BLOOM and OPT models show significant population skew, with strong model fit for some populations (e.g. North America, UK) and poor fit for others (e.g. South/Southeast Asia).  
- This skew is robust across different model sizes and training sets. It is not fully explained by socioeconomic factors or English speaking history.  
- There is also variation within countries - some local areas are better represented than others.

Main Contributions:
- Provides clear evidence that current LLMs have unequal representations across geographic populations despite controlling for language and register.
- Identifies a consistent and persistent "population skew" that challenges the idea that one model can serve all populations equally. 
- Offers a lightweight perplexity-based approach to probe model skew across populations that can be applied to other closed-source LLMs.
- Raises concerns about fairness and bias when applying these unevenly fitted models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates LLMs inadequately represent diverse global populations, exhibiting robust skew unrelated to social factors. The authors urge reconsidering the goal of a single general purpose LLM fitting all populations equally.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper measures how well two families of large language models represent diverse geographic populations in their training data by using a spatial probing task on comparable corpora to show significant variation in model performance across populations that cannot be fully explained by social factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper measures the degree to which two families of large language models (LLMs), BigScience's BLOOM models and Facebook's OPT models, represent diverse geographic populations around the world. Using a spatial probing task on geo-referenced corpora representing 927 local populations, the paper shows these LLMs have a strong and persistent skew, performing much better on some populations (like North America and the UK) compared to others (like South and Southeast Asia). This challenges the idea that a single LLM can adequately represent language use across different populations, even within the same language. The paper thus demonstrates and quantifies the presence of "population skew" in major LLMs.

So in summary, the main contribution is revealing and quantifying the unequal representation of diverse global populations within leading LLMs through a novel spatial probing methodology. This highlights issues of fairness and equity in applying these models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Spatial probing - Using geographic corpora and location information to evaluate how well language models represent different populations.

- Population skew - The phenomenon where language models perform better on some populations than others, even when controlling for language and register. The paper finds a strong skew towards North American and UK populations. 

- Geographic corpora - Collections of texts that are associated with geographic location metadata. Used in the paper to create sub-corpora representing local populations.

- Perplexity - A measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. Used in the paper to quantify how well each language model fits the geographic sub-corpora.

- Pre-trained language models - Refers specifically to the BigScience Bloom and Facebook OPT series of models analyzed in the paper.

- Representativeness - The degree to which language models equally represent diverse populations. One of the key questions examined.

- Social factors - Aspects like population, GDP, air travel, etc. analyzed to try to explain the observed population skew.

So in summary, the key terms cover the methodology of spatial probing, the core findings around population skew, the models and corpora used, and the representativeness of language models. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses perplexity as the main evaluation metric to measure how well the language models represent different geographic populations. What are some potential limitations of using perplexity for this purpose? Could there be alternative metrics that may provide additional insights?

2. The sub-corpora created for each location have a fixed distribution of keywords, with one tweet per keyword. What impact could this approach have on the analysis? How might using complete tweets for each location change the results?  

3. The paper finds consistent skew across model families and sizes in how well different populations are represented. What additional analyses could be done to further understand the causes and implications of this skew? 

4. The models tested are all based on a causal language modeling objective. How might using models trained with different objectives impact the geographic representation skew observed?

5. The paper hypothesizes differences in training data as a potential cause of the population skew. What specific properties of the training data could contribute to this skew and how might they be analyzed?

6. The study uses English language tweets to control for language variation. How might expanding the analysis to multiple languages provide additional insights into representation skew?

7. The paper finds minimal impact of factors like GDP and population size on representation quality. What other economic, social or linguistic factors may correlate with representation skew?  

8. The keywords used to construct the sub-corpora are common terms not tied to specific topics. How might constructing sub-corpora around different topics impact the results?

9. The study relies on tweets collected around airport locations. In what ways could the choice of geographic anchor points impact the populations sampled and the results?

10. The paper suggests tailored adaptation for under-represented populations. What specific adaptation approaches could be effective and how might they maintain capabilities for well-represented populations?
