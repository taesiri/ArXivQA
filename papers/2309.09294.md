# [LivelySpeaker: Towards Semantic-Aware Co-Speech Gesture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09294)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we generate co-speech gestures that are both semantically meaningful and rhythmically aligned with the speech?

The key points are:

- Most prior work has focused on generating gestures aligned with the speech rhythm (driven by audio signals), but lacks semantic meaning. 

- Some recent works try to incorporate semantics but rely heavily on predefined gesture classes/keywords, limiting the ability to convey complex intentions.

- This paper proposes a new two-stage framework called LivelySpeaker to generate semantically meaningful and rhythmically aligned co-speech gestures.

Specifically, the two main components are:

1) Semantic-aware generator (SAG) that uses CLIP text embeddings to guide gesture generation based solely on speech scripts. This captures semantic meaning.

2) Rhythm-aware generator (RAG) based on a diffusion model that takes audio as input to generate rhythmic gestures. 

By combining SAG and RAG, the goal is to produce gestures with both semantic awareness from texts and rhythm alignment from audio.

In summary, the core research question is how to effectively incorporate semantics while maintaining rhythm in co-speech gesture generation, which this two-stage SAG + RAG framework aims to address.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- Proposing a novel two-stage framework called LivelySpeaker for semantic-aware and rhythm-aware co-speech gesture generation. 

- Devising a new MLP-based diffusion model as the core generative backbone, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks for co-speech generation.

- Enabling new applications in co-speech gesture generation through the proposed framework, such as text prompt-based gesture control and balancing the influence between textual and audio modalities.

Specifically, the paper introduces a two-stage approach that first generates semantic gestures from text using CLIP embeddings, then refines the rhythm using a diffusion model conditioned only on audio. By training the two stages separately, the framework allows controlling the semantic meaning and rhythm alignment. The diffusion model uses MLPs rather than transformers, and outperforms GAN approaches on existing datasets. Overall, the main contribution seems to be proposing this novel decoupled framework to generate more controllable and higher quality co-speech gestures.
