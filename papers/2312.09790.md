# [End-to-End Training of Neural Networks for Automotive Radar Interference   Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- FMCW radar is prone to interference from other radars operating in the same frequency range, causing corrupted radar signals and making object detection difficult. 
- Existing machine learning approaches for interference mitigation train neural networks (NNs) to regress from corrupted to clean radar signals. However, residual errors in the NNs' predictions can still degrade object detection performance. There is a mismatch between the NNs' training objective and the true goal of enabling accurate object detection.

Proposed Solution: 
- Train NNs end-to-end for object detection instead of pure signal reconstruction. This is done by continuously relaxing the operations in an existing cell-averaging CFAR detector to make them differentiable. 
- The NNs are optimized using a balanced cross-entropy loss between their predicted object detections and ground truth, backpropagating through the differentiable CFAR detector. This aligns the training objective with the actual goal.

Main Contributions:
- Novel end-to-end training procedure for NNs that optimizes them directly for object detection performance instead of just signal similarity.
- Introduction of separable convolution kernels that encode prior knowledge of objects into NN architectures, significantly reducing parameters and computation.
- Evaluation on real-world radar data showing proposed method improves object detection F1 score substantially compared to other interference mitigation techniques.

In summary, the key innovation is closing the gap between the NNs' training objective and true desired goal of accurate object detection. This is done by directly optimizing the NNs end-to-end using a differentiable radar object detector model, while also reducing their complexity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes end-to-end training of neural networks for automotive radar interference mitigation by continuously relaxing the cell-averaging CFAR detector to enable gradients, and introduces separable convolutions to reduce model complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method for training neural networks (NNs) for frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar mutual interference mitigation. Specifically, instead of training NNs to regress from interfered to clean radar signals as in previous work, this paper trains NNs directly on object detection maps using a continuous relaxation of the cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CA-CFAR) detector. This new training objective allows the NNs to increase object detection performance by a large margin. The paper also introduces separable convolution kernels to reduce the number of parameters and computational complexity of convolutional NN architectures for radar applications.

In summary, the two main contributions are:

1) End-to-end training of NNs for radar interference mitigation by continuously relaxing the CA-CFAR detector to enable training on object detection maps rather than clean radar signals. This increases object detection performance.

2) Introduction of separable convolutions to reduce complexity of convolutional NN architectures for radar while maintaining performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes end-to-end training of neural networks for radar interference mitigation. How is this approach different from prior work that performs regression from interfered to clean radar signals? What are the potential advantages of the proposed approach?

2. The method performs continuous relaxation of the CA-CFAR detector to enable differentiability. Explain in detail how the threshold comparison operator is relaxed and why this enables gradients to be backpropagated through the CA-CFAR detector. 

3. The balanced cross entropy (BCE) loss is used during training. Explain what the BCE loss is, why it is suitable for this highly imbalanced binary classification task, and how the weighting hyperparameter Î± influences optimization.

4. In the experimental results, training on BCE significantly outperforms other objectives like MSE and MAGMSE in terms of F1 score. Analyze these results - why does BCE lead to better object detection performance despite higher MAGMSE?

5. The method introduces separable convolutions to encode domain knowledge about independence of range, velocity and angle. Explain in detail the concept of separable convolutions, why they can encode this domain knowledge, and their advantages regarding model complexity. 

6. The impact of separable convolutions differs greatly depending on the training objective used. Analyze and discuss the reasons behind why separable convolutions benefit BCE but deteriorate MSE performance.

7. When trained on BCE, interference mitigation is learned implicitly by uncovering masked objects. Explain why ensuring a sufficient number of masked objects is therefore critical for learning with the BCE objective.

8. Unlike other radar interference mitigation methods, zeroing performs competitively. Speculate why zeroing outperforms other signal processing methods like ramp filtering and IMAT in this scenario with high interference.

9. Discuss robustness issues that need to be addressed before neural network interference mitigation can be deployed in practice, and explain why both robustness and explainability are critical for this safety application. 

10. Propose ideas for future work to increase robustness and explainability of neural networks for radar interference mitigation.
