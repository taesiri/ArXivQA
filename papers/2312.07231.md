# [Fast Training of Diffusion Transformer with Extreme Masking for 3D Point   Clouds Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07231)

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a review of the LaTeX source code provided, some of the key terms and concepts that appear to be associated with this paper include:

- Probability distributions/densities ($p_{\text{data}}$, $p_{\text{model}}$, etc.)
- Mathematical expectation/means ($\mathbb{E}$)  
- Loss functions ($\mathcal{L}$)
- Real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)
- Empirical estimates ($\tilde{p}$)  
- Learning rates ($\alpha$) 
- Regularization (Î»)
- Activation functions (rectifier, softmax, sigmoid)
- Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$)
- Variance (Var) 
- Covariance (Cov)
- Norms ($L^0$, $L^1$, $L^2$, $L^p$, $L^{\infty}$)
- Optimization (arg max/min)
- Matrix algebra (traces, vectors, matrices)

So it seems like a machine learning paper involving probability, statistics, optimization, and linear algebra. The model may involve neural networks or related methods based on the activation functions defined. Key goals seem to be modeling data distributions, minimizing losses, and managing overfitting via regularization.
