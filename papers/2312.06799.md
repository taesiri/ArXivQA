# [Densify Your Labels: Unsupervised Clustering with Bipartite Matching for   Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of weakly supervised semantic segmentation of point clouds, where only scene-level labels indicating the presence of object classes are available during training. Obtaining dense per-point labels is very costly and time-consuming. Existing methods relying on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) fail to distinguish between classes at the point level since all points in a scene share the same scene-level label. This leads to many false positive predictions.

Method:
The key idea is to over-segment the point clouds into primitives via unsupervised learning, and then match these primitives to semantic classes conservatively using bipartite matching with the scene labels. Specifically:

1) Point cloud features are extracted using a backbone network and clustered via K-means to obtain feature primitives. 

2) A cost matrix is constructed between primitives and semantic classes using class predictions and scene labels. 

3) Bipartite matching is performed to assign subset of primitives to scene labels. Unassigned primitives are ignored during training.

4) Assigned primitives supervise point features and get point-wise pseudo-labels for dense supervision.

Three losses are jointly optimized: CAM loss for scene labels, unsupervised loss for clustering, and matching loss for assignment.

Contributions:

- Propagates scene labels conservatively to points via primitives and bipartite matching.

- Provides analysis showing issues with previous CAM methods in distinguishing classes.

- Achieves new state-of-the-art for weakly supervised point cloud segmentation, even outperforming some fully supervised techniques.

- Demonstrates the impact of label co-occurrence on performance using S3DIS dataset analysis.

The method shows the potential of weakly supervised learning to achieve accurate segmentation without dense labels, significantly reducing annotation effort.
