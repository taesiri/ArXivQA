# [CodeS: Towards Building Open-source Language Models for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16347)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art text-to-SQL models rely on closed-source, expensive large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ChatGPT, which have limitations such as unclear model architectures, data privacy risks, and high computational costs.  
- There is a need for open-source text-to-SQL models that are specifically optimized for SQL generation while being efficient and adaptable to real-world applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce CodeS, a series of open-source language models with parameters ranging from 1B to 15B that are specially designed and incrementally pre-trained for text-to-SQL using a curated SQL-centric corpus.
- Enhance CodeS's text-to-SQL performance using a comprehensive database prompt construction strategy and a bi-directional data augmentation technique for rapid adaptation to new domains with limited labeled data.

Main Contributions:
- Open-source CodeS models that achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on text-to-SQL benchmarks like Spider and BIRD while being 10-100x smaller than existing closed-source LLMs.
- A SQL-focused incremental pre-training approach and corpus to boost language models' SQL generation capability.  
- A database prompt construction method incorporating schema filter, value retriever and metadata to provide richer context.
- A bi-directional data augmentation technique for low-cost fine-tuning on new domains by combining authentic user questions with structured templates.
- Extensive experiments demonstrating CodeS models' superior accuracy, robustness and efficiency compared to prior arts on various text-to-SQL datasets.
- Open-source all the code, models and data to promote research and adoption of specialized text-to-SQL models.

The paper makes significant contributions in developing efficient yet performant open-source text-to-SQL models to overcome limitations of existing closed-source LLMs. The proposed techniques and models could enable easier deployment of text-to-SQL systems in real-world applications.
