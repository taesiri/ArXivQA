# [Self-Supervised Video Forensics by Audio-Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01767)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: Can video manipulation be detected through self-supervised anomaly detection using audio-visual synchronization features, without requiring any manipulated training examples?Specifically, the key hypothesis appears to be:Videos that have manipulated speech/faces will contain subtle inconsistencies between the visual and audio signals. By modeling the joint distribution of audio-visual synchronization features extracted from real unlabeled videos, manipulated videos can be identified as anomalies/outliers at test time.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for video forensics, using features that capture audio-visual synchronization patterns learned from real videos. The key hypothesis is that this method can identify manipulated videos as anomalies, despite being trained solely on real examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a video forensics method based on anomaly detection that can be trained solely on real, unlabeled videos. The key idea is to detect subtle inconsistencies between visual and audio signals that may indicate manipulation.- Introducing the concept of "synchronization features", which are audio-visual features designed to convey temporal alignment between vision and sound streams in a video. The paper evaluates different options for synchronization features.- Showing that an autoregressive model can be trained on sequences of synchronization features extracted from real videos, and then used to detect anomalies at test time by assigning low probability to manipulated videos.- Demonstrating strong performance on detecting manipulated speech videos by evaluating on the FakeAVCeleb and KoDF datasets. The method generalizes well despite being trained only on real videos from other datasets.- Analyzing the robustness of the method to various perturbations like compression, blurring, etc. as well as showing generalization to unseen languages.Overall, the key contribution is developing a self-supervised anomaly detection approach for video forensics that relies only on unlabeled real training data. This is enabled by using synchronization features that capture consistency between modalities.
