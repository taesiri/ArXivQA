# [Self-Supervised Video Forensics by Audio-Visual Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01767)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: Can video manipulation be detected through self-supervised anomaly detection using audio-visual synchronization features, without requiring any manipulated training examples?Specifically, the key hypothesis appears to be:Videos that have manipulated speech/faces will contain subtle inconsistencies between the visual and audio signals. By modeling the joint distribution of audio-visual synchronization features extracted from real unlabeled videos, manipulated videos can be identified as anomalies/outliers at test time.In summary, the paper proposes and evaluates an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for video forensics, using features that capture audio-visual synchronization patterns learned from real videos. The key hypothesis is that this method can identify manipulated videos as anomalies, despite being trained solely on real examples.
