## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in evaluating and benchmarking large language models:- It takes a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach to evaluation across 7 ability dimensions and 51 datasets. This is more expansive than many other benchmarks like GLUE, SuperGLUE, etc. which tend to focus evaluation on a smaller set of core NLP tasks. - The use of 3 complementary evaluation methods (metrics, scoring, comparative) provides a more robust assessment from different angles. Other benchmarks frequently rely on just metrics-based evaluation.- There is a strong emphasis on evaluating knowledge abilities of LLMs, going beyond just assessing their core linguistic skills. This responds to the need to better understand the knowledge capacities of models like ChatGPT.- It provides the first comprehensive Chinese language benchmark for LLMs, whereas most prior benchmarks have focused solely on English. - The benchmark includes datasets specifically created to avoid train/test data leakage, which helps ensure more fair assessments.- The public platform allows community participation in evaluation, model comparisons, and benchmark leaderboards.Overall, the multi-dimensional coverage, diverse evaluation methods, knowledge assessment focus, inclusion of Chinese, and public participation platform help differentiate this benchmark from prior work and provide a more comprehensive evaluation suite as LLMs continue to evolve. It pushes forward the state-of-the-art in LLM evaluation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:1. Continuously construct high-quality evaluation datasets to enrich the ZhuJiu benchmark. The authors point out the importance of having diverse and high-quality datasets for comprehensively evaluating large language models. They suggest expanding the datasets in ZhuJiu to cover more abilities and domains.2. Further develop the assessment of knowledge ability and new evaluation methods tailored to Chinese characteristics. The paper puts a strong emphasis on evaluating knowledge ability of models. The authors suggest enhancing the knowledge evaluation framework and developing specialized methods to assess Chinese language skills. 3. Improve the functionality of the online evaluation platform and regularly update the platform. The authors propose maintaining the platform, adding new features, and updating model evaluation results on a regular basis. This will make ZhuJiu a dynamic and useful benchmark.4. Evaluate more large language models, especially larger ones beyond the 10B parameter scale assessed so far. The authors note the limitations of 10B parameter models evaluated in the paper and suggest assessing larger models to better understand model capabilities.5. Analyze model strengths and weaknesses in more depth. The paper provides some high-level analysis of model performance, but the authors suggest doing more fine-grained analysis to uncover model capabilities and limitations.In summary, the main future directions are: expanding the benchmark's datasets and assessments, especially for knowledge and Chinese abilities; improving the evaluation platform; evaluating more and larger models; and conducting deeper performance analysis. The authors aim to make ZhuJiu an authoritative and comprehensive Chinese benchmark for driving large language model research.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is proposing a new benchmark called "ZhuJiu" for comprehensively evaluating large language models (LLMs). The key problems it aims to address are:- Most existing benchmarks only evaluate LLMs on a single dimension of ability, and cannot provide comprehensive evaluation. - They typically only use a single evaluation method, which may not accurately measure all abilities.- There is a lack of comprehensive Chinese benchmarks for evaluating LLMs. - Many benchmarks use only public datasets, risking potential data leakage issues.To solve these problems, the ZhuJiu benchmark has the following strengths:- Multi-dimensional ability coverage: It evaluates LLMs across 7 ability dimensions covering 51 tasks. - Multi-faceted evaluation methods: It uses 3 complementary evaluation methods (metrics, scoring, comparative) to ensure accurate assessment.- Comprehensive Chinese benchmark: ZhuJiu is the first benchmark that can fully assess LLMs in Chinese. - Avoiding data leakage: It constructs 37 new datasets to prevent data leakage issues.In summary, the key problem is the lack of a comprehensive, multi-dimensional, multi-method benchmark, especially for Chinese LLMs. ZhuJiu aims to create such a benchmark to enable more robust LLM evaluation.
