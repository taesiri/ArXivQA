# [Bayesian Federated Learning Via Expectation Maximization and Turbo Deep   Approximate Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Standard federated learning (FL) algorithms use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for local model training, which has drawbacks like slow convergence, vanishing/exploding gradients, and getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. 
- Large deep neural network (DNN) models also need compression for efficient inference, but regularization-based pruning methods cannot precisely control the compression ratio.
- Traditional DNNs also tend to be overconfident in predictions, which is problematic for applications like autonomous driving.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Bayesian federated learning (BFL) framework to formulate DNN learning as Bayesian inference and structured compression as group sparse priors.
- Use expectation maximization (EM) to update hyperparameters and accelerate convergence - E-step computes posterior distributions, M-step updates hyperparameters.
- Propose turbo deep approximate message passing (TDAMP) algorithm for efficient Bayesian learning at clients:
   - Module B: sum-product message passing for group sparse prior
   - Module A: deep approximate message passing over DNN
   - PasP: automatic tuning of local priors
- Central server aggregates local posteriors to update global posterior and hyperparameters.

Main Contributions:
- Bayesian FL framework with group sparse prior for structured compression
- TDAMP algorithm combining EM, approximate message passing, group sparsity
- Specific algorithm design for regression (housing prediction) and classification (digit recognition)
- Simulation results showing faster convergence and better performance compared to Adam-based methods

The key novelty is formulating FL as Bayesian inference to avoid drawbacks of SGD-based methods, and using message passing to exploit structured sparsity for compression. The proposed EM-TDAMP method achieves superior performance especially for high compression ratios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a Bayesian federated learning framework called EM-TDAMP that efficiently performs distributed deep neural network learning and structured compression via expectation maximization and turbo deep approximate message passing algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a Bayesian federated learning (BFL) framework to enable learning and structured compression for deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, it formulates the DNN learning problem as Bayesian inference and proposes a group sparse prior distribution to achieve neuron-level pruning during training. 

2. It proposes an efficient BFL algorithm called EM-TDAMP, which combines expectation maximization (EM) at the central server and turbo deep approximate message passing (TDAMP) at the clients. The central server aggregates posterior distributions from clients to update global posterior and hyperparameters. The clients perform TDAMP for efficient approximate message passing over the DNN.

3. It details the application of EM-TDAMP to two tasks - Boston housing price prediction and handwriting recognition. It presents extensive numerical results demonstrating the advantages of EM-TDAMP in terms of faster convergence and better prediction/recognition performance compared to SGD-based training algorithms.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the EM-TDAMP algorithm to achieve efficient Bayesian federated learning and structured compression of DNNs.
