# [ConvSDG: Session Data Generation for Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational search systems allow users to interactively search for information through multi-turn conversations. However, current methods struggle to understand complex search intents due to lack of sufficient training data. 
- Manually creating more conversational search data is costly and difficult. Therefore, automatically generating additional high-quality training data could improve conversational search performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ConvSDG, a framework to automatically generate conversational search session data using large language models (LLMs). 
- They design two prompts at dialogue and query levels to instruct the LLM to generate session data. The prompts leverage topic descriptions or existing queries to guide coherent session generation.
- They produce supervision signals for the generated session data based on pseudo-relevance feedback or existing annotations to enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. 
- The augmented session data is then used to fine-tune conversational dense retrievers.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of using automatically generated session data to train conversational search models, achieving better performance than relying solely on human-curated datasets.
- Develop dialogue and query-level data generation approaches to produce sessions and expanded queries guided by topics or annotations.
- Generate supervision signals for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning through pseudo relevance feedback and existing judgments.  
- Extensive experiments validate effectiveness of ConvSDG framework over strong baselines on four benchmark datasets, under both data availability settings.

In summary, the paper proposes an automatic data augmentation framework ConvSDG that leverages LLMs to generate high-quality session data for enhancing conversational search. The augmented data helps mitigate lack of training data and significantly boosts performance.
