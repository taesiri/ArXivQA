# [ConvSDG: Session Data Generation for Conversational Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conversational search systems allow users to interactively search for information through multi-turn conversations. However, current methods struggle to understand complex search intents due to lack of sufficient training data. 
- Manually creating more conversational search data is costly and difficult. Therefore, automatically generating additional high-quality training data could improve conversational search performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose ConvSDG, a framework to automatically generate conversational search session data using large language models (LLMs). 
- They design two prompts at dialogue and query levels to instruct the LLM to generate session data. The prompts leverage topic descriptions or existing queries to guide coherent session generation.
- They produce supervision signals for the generated session data based on pseudo-relevance feedback or existing annotations to enable unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. 
- The augmented session data is then used to fine-tune conversational dense retrievers.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of using automatically generated session data to train conversational search models, achieving better performance than relying solely on human-curated datasets.
- Develop dialogue and query-level data generation approaches to produce sessions and expanded queries guided by topics or annotations.
- Generate supervision signals for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning through pseudo relevance feedback and existing judgments.  
- Extensive experiments validate effectiveness of ConvSDG framework over strong baselines on four benchmark datasets, under both data availability settings.

In summary, the paper proposes an automatic data augmentation framework ConvSDG that leverages LLMs to generate high-quality session data for enhancing conversational search. The augmented data helps mitigate lack of training data and significantly boosts performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes ConvSDG, a framework to automatically generate high-quality conversational search session data using large language models, which is then utilized to effectively fine-tune conversational dense retrievers for enhanced performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes ConvSDG, a novel framework to automatically generate session data for conversational search using large language models (LLMs). This helps address the problem of limited training data availability.

2) It develops two approaches to instruct the LLM to produce session data - at the dialogue level to generate entire conversational sessions, and at the query level to generate augmented queries. It also generates necessary supervision signals to facilitate different manners of learning.

3) Through comprehensive experiments on four widely used datasets, it demonstrates the effectiveness of ConvSDG in improving the performance of conversational dense retrieval compared to strong baselines. The analysis also provides insights into the potential of automatic data generation to enhance conversational search.

In summary, the paper explores the feasibility of exploiting LLM-based automatic session data generation to boost conversational search models, and shows its effectiveness over manual datasets across different scenarios.

The paper introduces a framework called "ConvSDG" that uses large language models to automatically generate conversational search session data. This additional data is then used to fine-tune conversational dense retrieval models in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner. The goal is to address the problem of limited training data availability for conversational search systems. The results demonstrate improved performance over strong baseline methods on several datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two different prompts for generating conversational search data - one at the dialogue level and one at the query level. What are the key differences between these two prompts in terms of the information they provide to the language model? How might these differences impact the quality of the generated data?

2. When generating supervision signals in an unsupervised manner, the paper explores using four different query input forms for pseudo-relevance feedback. Why is the choice of query input form important in this context? What are some potential downsides of the different options explored?

3. The paper demonstrates that increasing the amount of generated conversational search data used for fine-tuning leads to improved performance, especially in an unsupervised setting. However, in a semi-supervised setting, performance only improves once a sufficient volume of data is added. What might explain this discrepancy? How could the framework be adapted to ensure consistent improvements with added generated data?

4. Could the query-level and dialogue-level data generation approaches be combined within the proposed framework? If so, how might they complement each other? If not, what are the obstacles to integrating both techniques? 

5. The paper focuses on using a single large language model (LLM) for data generation. How could the framework potentially leverage or combine multiple LLMs? What benefits or challenges might this introduce?

6. What types of filtering mechanisms could help address potential distribution shifts when combining original and generated conversational search data? How could such mechanisms be incorporated into the framework?

7. The paper demonstrates the value of generated data for improving conversational dense retrieval. Could the framework also generate useful data for other conversational search techniques like conversational query rewriting? Why or why not?

8. What other information retrieval tasks beyond conversational search might benefit from applying data generation techniques similar to those proposed in this paper? What adaptations would need to be made?

9. How suitable do you think the data generation framework would be for a commercial conversational search system dealing with real user queries at scale? What additional experimentation could provide more insight?  

10. The paper focuses solely on English conversational search data. How could the framework be adapted to generate data in other languages? What new challenges might this introduce?
