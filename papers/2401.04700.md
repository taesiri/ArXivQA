# [Model Editing Can Hurt General Abilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04700)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) inevitably manifest hallucinations due to false or outdated knowledge in their parameters, degrading performance. 
- Retraining LLMs with updated information is resource-intensive. Model editing methods have been proposed as a more efficient way to update LLMs' knowledge.
- However, current editing methods tend to overemphasize efficacy, generalization and locality in editing performance while overlooking potential side effects on LLMs' general abilities.  

Proposed Solution:
- Systematically analyze side effects of model editing by evaluating four popular methods (KN, MEND, ROME, MEMIT) on two LLMs (GPT-2 XL, LLaMA-1) across eight task categories.

Key Findings:
- Editing does improve model factuality but at the expense of substantially impairing general abilities of reasoning, QA, dialogue, summarization etc.  
- Performance degradation trends are consistent across instance- vs batch-editing and single- vs sequential-editing settings.
- Larger LM LLaMA-1 exhibited greater fragility to edits compared to GPT-2.

Main Contributions:
- First paper to systematically study and confirm that current model editing methods hurt general abilities of LLMs.
- Reveals the trade-off between improving factuality and preserving capabilities on broader tasks.
- Advocates focusing research on minimizing loss of general abilities during editing to enable sustainable progress.

In summary, the paper provides an extensive analysis highlighting the overlooked side effects of existing model editing techniques and argues for more research on developing editing methods that can update factual knowledge without compromising general abilities of LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper raises concerns that current model editing methods, while improving model factuality, may significantly degrade the general abilities of large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is systematically evaluating the side effects of popular model editing methods on the general abilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) It raises concerns that current model editing methods, while effective at improving model factuality, may significantly hurt the general abilities of LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. This trade-off could hamper the sustainable development of LLMs.

2) It analyzes the side effects of four popular editing methods (KN, MEND, ROME, MEMIT) on two LLMs (GPT-2 XL, LLaMA-1) using eight representative task categories. The results show that editing does improve factuality but substantially impairs general abilities of the models.

3) It makes an important call to action for more research efforts to not only enhance factuality through editing but also preserve the general abilities acquired during LLM pre-training. This includes strengthening model robustness, exploring new editing paradigms, and comprehensive evaluation methodologies.

In summary, the paper provides the first systematic study on the side effects of model editing methods on LLM general abilities, reveals a concerning trade-off that should be avoided, and advocates more research to improve factuality while retaining abilities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper systematically evaluates editing methods in "single-" vs "sequential-" editing settings. What are the key differences between single and sequential editing? Why is it important to evaluate editing methods in both settings?  

2. The paper also evaluates editing methods in "instance-" vs "batch-" editing settings. What do these settings refer to and why is it valuable to assess editing performance across both?

3. The paper conducts extensive experiments across 8 different task categories. What are some of the key tasks evaluated? Why is it important to measure editing impact across diverse tasks instead of just factuality metrics?  

4. The authors reveal that current editing methods significantly damage the general abilities of LLMs, calling this the "penny-wise and pound-foolish" trap. Elaborate further on what this refers to and why avoiding this trade-off is critical.

5. The paper advocates strengthening robustness of LLMs to weight updates. What methods could help address model sensitivity to parameter changes during editing? Discuss the challenges and potential techniques.  

6. The paper calls for new editing paradigms that enhance factuality while sustaining general abilities. Brainstorm some ideas for novel frameworks to achieve both objectives concurrently.   

7. What are some limitations of existing comprehension metrics used to evaluate editing methods? Suggest additional metrics that could provide deeper assessment.

8. The adopted editing datasets mainly focus on factuality. What are some other forms of knowledge beyond facts that editing methods should also consider handling?

9. Discuss whether the decrease in performance on general tasks is primarily due to editing methods or the brittleness of LLMs themselves. Provide arguments supporting both perspectives.  

10. The paper focuses on analyzing editing impact on autoregressive LMs. How might the observations differ for other model architectures like retrievers or dense encoders? Discuss potential similarities and differences.
