# [LexC-Gen: Generating Data for Extremely Low-Resource Languages with   Large Language Models and Bilingual Lexicons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14086)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extremely low-resource languages lack labeled data for NLP tasks. Bilingual lexicons can help translate existing labeled data from high-resource languages, but there is often low lexical overlap between existing task data and lexicons. This results in poor translation coverage and utilization of the lexicons.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes LexC-Gen, a lexicon-conditioned data generation method. It uses large language models (LLMs) to generate labeled task data in a high-resource language (e.g. English) that has high lexical overlap with a given bilingual lexicon. 
- The generated data is then translated word-by-word into the low-resource language using the lexicon. This improves translation coverage and lexicon utilization.
- LexC-Gen also employs quality control by filtering out instances where the generated input text does not match the generated label.

Main Contributions:
- Shows LexC-Gen generated data competitive with expert-translated gold data in extremely low-resource languages, outperforming prior lexicon-based translation methods.
- Demonstrates the importance of lexicon-conditioning when generating the data - simply scaling up raw generated data is insufficient.  
- Analysis shows higher lexicon utilization is key to better downstream task performance.
- Shows only a single GPU is needed for efficient large-scale data generation with LexC-Gen, reducing the practical barriers to using this method.

In summary, LexC-Gen is a promising data generation technique to help alleviate the lack of training data in extremely low-resource languages by improving lexicon translation coverage and utilization.
