# [Training Curricula for Open Domain Answer Re-Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14269)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Are the proposed training curricula effective for training neural rankers for answer ranking? (Evaluated in Sections 4.1-4.3)

2) Under which conditions is each curriculum more effective (e.g. amount of training data, type of neural ranker, etc.)? (Evaluated across Sections 4.1-4.3) 

3) Is it important to shift to difficult samples during training, or can a ranker be successfully trained by focusing only on easy samples? (Evaluated in Section 4.4)

4) Is focusing on the easy samples first more beneficial than focusing on the hardest samples first during training? (Evaluated in Section 4.5)

The overall goal seems to be evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed training curricula, which weight easy/difficult samples differently during training, for improving neural rankers on answer ranking tasks. The main hypotheses appear to be that the curricula will improve performance across tasks/models (RQ1), certain curricula will work better in certain scenarios (RQ2), it's important to shift to difficult samples later in training (RQ3), and focusing on easy samples first is better than hardest first (RQ4). The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a curriculum learning approach for training neural ranking models for open-domain answer re-ranking. The key ideas are:

- They propose using curriculum learning to assign different weights to training samples based on their estimated "difficulty". Easy samples get higher weight early in training, while difficult samples get lower weight.

- They propose three heuristics to estimate sample difficulty based on the ranking and score of an unsupervised first-stage ranker: reciprocal rank, normalized score, and kernel density estimation (KDE).

- They show their curricula approach is effective across three neural ranking models (BERT, ConvKNRM), three datasets (TREC DL, CAR, ANTIQUE), and both pairwise and pointwise losses.

- Their approach achieves gains in ranking accuracy compared to no curriculum, and reaches performance comparable to larger BERT models and more complex training techniques.

- They analyze the impact of curriculum hyperparameters like end epoch and show the importance of eventually giving equal weight to all samples.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating an effective way to apply curriculum learning to improve training of neural rankers for answer re-ranking, using simple heuristics based on the first-stage ranker.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using curriculum learning to train neural ranking models for answer retrieval by starting with easy training samples and progressively incorporating more difficult samples, which is shown to improve ranking performance on several datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points in comparing this paper to other research on curriculum learning for neural ranking models:

- Focus on Open Domain Answer Ranking: This paper focuses specifically on applying curriculum learning to improve neural ranking models for open domain answer ranking across multiple datasets (TREC DL, CAR, ANTIQUE). Many prior works applying curriculum learning focus on other tasks like closed-domain QA, document ranking, etc. 

- Simple and Effective Heuristics: The heuristics proposed in this paper for estimating training sample difficulty are quite simple, relying only on the rank/score from an unsupervised first stage ranker like BM25. Despite the simplicity, the heuristics are shown to be highly effective across models and datasets. Other curriculum learning works often use more complex heuristics tailored to their domain.

- Evaluated on Multiple Models: The curriculum learning approach is evaluated with different neural ranking architectures like BERT and ConvKNRM. Showing consistent improvements across models strengthens the validity of the approach. Some prior work focuses evaluation on just one model architecture.

- Compared to Anti-Curriculum: An analysis is provided showing that focusing on easy samples first is better than an anti-curriculum focused on hard samples first. This helps justify the curriculum design choices.

- Thorough Evaluation: A comprehensive evaluation is provided analyzing 3 datasets, 2 neural rankers, 2 loss functions, and 3 difficulty heuristics. Many dimensions are explored to understand when the approach is most effective. Some related works provide more limited analysis.

Overall, the simplicity and general effectiveness of the heuristics combined with the thorough evaluation across multiple conditions helps strengthen the validity and usefulness of the curriculum learning approach proposed compared to related literature. The focus on open domain answer ranking is also notable as a contribution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring alternative difficulty degradation functions or applying the curriculum learning approach to other models/tasks, such as domain adaptation. The authors suggest their difficulty heuristics could be a good starting point for more intelligent sampling strategies as well.

- Combining the weighting strategies proposed in the paper with more advanced sampling techniques for selecting relevant and non-relevant training pairs. The weighting could help ensure easy samples are still ranked effectively.

- Using self-paced learning techniques that allow the model to learn which training sample characteristics make a sample easy or difficult, instead of relying solely on heuristics designed by humans.

- Applying the ideas to other tasks and domains beyond answer ranking, such as initial retrieval, domain-specific ranking, etc. The authors suggest their approach may generalize.

- Evaluating the impact on recall-oriented metrics and diversifying the test collections used. The current work focused on precision-oriented ranking metrics.

- Exploring the characteristics of situations where constantly applying the difficulty weights is beneficial, as the authors found for the TREC CAR dataset. This could help adapt the techniques better.

In summary, the main suggestions are around exploring extensions to other models/tasks, combining it with more advanced sampling techniques, using self-paced learning, and evaluating in new settings with additional metrics and test collections. The authors seem to suggest their curriculum learning approach is broadly applicable.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using curriculum learning to train neural rankers for open-domain answer re-ranking. Curriculum learning starts training on easier examples before gradually incorporating more difficult ones. The authors propose three heuristics to estimate sample difficulty for answer ranking based on the rank and score of an initial retrieval stage (e.g. BM25). Easy samples are those where the initial ranker correctly ranks a relevant (or nonrelevant) passage highly (or lowly). Difficult samples are those where the initial ranker fails to do so. The heuristics assign higher loss weights to easy samples early in training, and weights converge to be equal later in training. Experiments on three answer ranking datasets with two neural rankers (BERT and ConvKNRM) show this curriculum approach significantly improves ranking effectiveness over no curriculum. The authors find it's important to converge weights to treat all samples equally, and focusing on easy samples first is better than hard samples first. The curricula allow models to approach state-of-the-art performance at lower cost.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a curriculum learning approach for training neural rankers for answer retrieval. Curriculum learning trains models starting with easier examples first before gradually incorporating more difficult examples. The authors propose measuring sample difficulty based on the rank and score of an initial ranker like BM25. Samples ranked highly by BM25 are considered "easy" while those ranked low are "difficult". 

Three heuristics are proposed for estimating sample difficulty: reciprocal rank, normalized score, and kernel density estimation (KDE). These difficulty estimates are used to weight samples during training, with easier samples weighted higher initially. As training progresses, sample weights converge to be equal. Experiments on three answer ranking datasets show curricula learning improves effectiveness over no curricula across multiple neural rankers. The reciprocal rank and KDE curricula are most effective overall. Results also show the convergence to equal weights is important, and focusing on easy samples first is better than hard samples first. The curricula allow models to approach state-of-the-art performance without extra complexity.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes using curriculum learning to train neural ranking models for answer re-ranking. The key idea is to estimate the "difficulty" of each training sample and use that to weight the samples during training. Easy samples are given higher weight early in training, while difficult samples are given lower weight. As training progresses, the weighting between easy and difficult samples is smoothed, so that eventually all samples are weighted equally regardless of difficulty. 

To estimate difficulty, the paper explores using the rank, score, or score distribution from an initial unsupervised ranking model like BM25. For example, samples ranked highly by BM25 are considered easy, while those ranked low are difficult. Three heuristics are proposed based on rank, normalized score, and kernel density estimation over the scores.

These difficulty heuristics are integrated into the loss function to weight samples during neural network training. The authors experiment with two neural ranking architectures (BERT and ConvKNRM) on three answer ranking datasets. Results show that their curricula lead to improved ranking effectiveness across datasets and models compared to no curriculum. The paper provides insights into when each heuristic works best and shows the importance of eventually training on all samples equally regardless of difficulty.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem the authors are addressing is how to effectively train neural ranking models for answer re-ranking. Specifically, they propose using curriculum learning to weight training samples during the training process in order to improve the ranking performance of neural models. 

The key questions and goals of the paper are:

- How can curriculum learning be applied to the training of neural ranking models for answer re-ranking?

The overall goal is to show that curriculum learning by weighting training samples can boost the effectiveness of neural ranking models on answer re-ranking tasks. The authors propose heuristics to estimate sample difficulty and integrate curriculum learning into the training process. They aim to demonstrate improved ranking performance across different models, datasets and training configurations compared to not using curriculum learning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper proposes training curricula for improving the effectiveness of neural rankers for answer ranking. The key idea is to weight training samples based on their predicted difficulty, with easier samples weighted higher early in training. Three heuristics for estimating sample difficulty are proposed based on the rank, score, or score distribution of an unsupervised first-stage ranker. Experiments on three answer ranking datasets (TREC Deep Learning, TREC Complex Answer Retrieval, and ANTIQUE) and two neural rankers (BERT and ConvKNRM) show that the proposed training curricula consistently improve ranking effectiveness compared to equal sample weighting. The rank-based and score distribution-based curricula tend to work best for natural language questions with human-judged labels, while the score-based curriculum works better for structured queries with inferred labels. The curricula allow models to approach the effectiveness of larger models while being more efficient. The results demonstrate the importance of eventually weighting all samples equally and focusing on easy samples before difficult ones. Overall, the paper presents a simple yet effective technique to improve neural ranker effectiveness through training sample weighting.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a training curriculum approach for enhancing neural ranking models for open-domain answer re-ranking. Curriculum learning involves gradually increasing the difficulty of training samples over the course of training to help models learn more effectively. The authors propose three heuristics for estimating the difficulty of a training sample based on the rank and score of an initial unsupervised ranker. 

The heuristics weight easy samples higher early in training, where easy samples are those correctly ranked high (for relevant answers) or low (for non-relevant answers) by the initial ranker. As training progresses, the curriculum gradually weights all samples equally. This approach is evaluated using BERT and ConvKNRM models on three answer ranking datasets - TREC Deep Learning, TREC CAR, and ANTIQUE.

The results demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance across models, losses, and datasets by using the proposed training curricula. The best curriculum varies based on factors like label quality. The curricula are able to boost models to match or exceed standard baselines and approach state-of-the-art with simpler models. Convergence to equal sample weights is important for effectiveness. Overall, the paper presents a simple yet effective approach to improve neural ranking through intelligent training sample weighting.
