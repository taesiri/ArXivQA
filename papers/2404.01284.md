## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing motion generation methods focus on specialized models for individual tasks like text-to-motion or music-to-dance. This limits their capability and generalization. 
- Integrating multi-modal motion data is challenging due to inconsistent data formats, evaluation metrics and difficulty in transferring knowledge across tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce MotionVerse, a large-scale multi-modal motion benchmark with 16 datasets, 100M frames and 10 tasks. It has a unified data format and problem formulation.

- Propose Large Motion Model (LMM), built on a transformer diffusion model, with a novel Articulated Attention (ArtAttention) mechanism for body part modeling.

- Devise a two-stage training strategy involving unsupervised pretraining with frame rate/masking augmentations and supervised finetuning.

Key Contributions:

1) MotionVerse benchmark with unified motion representation for multi-modal, multi-task data.

2) Large Motion Model (LMM) with specialized ArtAttention mechanism for control over body parts.

3) Two-stage training approach to effectively leverage diverse motion datasets and enhance model capabilities.

4) State-of-the-art results on motion generation across 9 tasks. LMM shows strong generalization and emerging cross-task capabilities.

5) Extensive ablation studies to provide insights on training and scaling up large motion models.

In summary, the paper introduces MotionVerse and Large Motion Model to unify diverse motion generation tasks into a single versatile model with strong performance across different datasets and modalities. The solution focuses on unified data representation, specialized model architecture and an effective training approach.
