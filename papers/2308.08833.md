# [CMB: A Comprehensive Medical Benchmark in Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key aspects of this paper are:1. Research focus: The paper proposes a comprehensive Chinese medical benchmark called CMB to evaluate medical LLMs. CMB consists of two parts - CMB-Exam containing multiple choice questions, and CMB-Clin containing clinical diagnostic questions. 2. Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks are either in English or do not sufficiently cover the unique characteristics of Chinese medicine. The authors argue for the need to create a localized benchmark rooted in the native Chinese linguistic and medical context.3. Approach: CMB-Exam leverages real exam questions spanning various medical professions and difficulty levels. CMB-Clin uses textbook case studies to assess clinical diagnostic and reasoning skills. The benchmark is designed to provide fine-grained feedback and analyze model capabilities across knowledge areas.4. Experiments: The paper benchmarks prominent LLMs on CMB-Exam and CMB-Clin. It analyzes model performance across specialties, decoding strategies, few-shot prompts, and compares results to expert evaluation. 5. Key observations: The results reveal GPT-4's significant superiority, the need for better medical LLMs, performance disparities across knowledge areas like Chinese vs Western medicine, and effectiveness of evaluation strategies.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a localized, comprehensive Chinese medical benchmark is required to effectively evaluate the progression of medical LLMs, which this work aims to address through the proposed CMB dataset and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a comprehensive medical benchmark dataset called CMB for evaluating Chinese medical language models. CMB contains two components:- CMB-Exam: Multiple choice questions covering medical licensing exams for various professions like physicians, nurses, pharmacists etc.- CMB-Clin: Clinical diagnostic questions based on real-world medical case studies.2. Evaluating prominent Chinese medical language models like HuatuoGPT, BianQue, ChatMed-Consult etc. on the CMB dataset. The results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of current medical LLMs. 3. Providing analysis on factors like few-shot prompting, chain of thought, decoding strategies etc. and their impact on medical LLM performance.4. Demonstrating that automatic evaluation using general LLMs like GPT-4 produces highly correlated results with expert evaluation, which can help reduce manual judging costs. 5. Highlighting the need for localized medical benchmarks tailored to the linguistic and cultural contexts of different regions, rather than merely translating English datasets.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of CMB as a comprehensive benchmark for assessing and driving progress in Chinese medical LLMs in a localized context. The empirical evaluations and analysis also provide valuable insights into current models.
