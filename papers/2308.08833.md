# [CMB: A Comprehensive Medical Benchmark in Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key aspects of this paper are:1. Research focus: The paper proposes a comprehensive Chinese medical benchmark called CMB to evaluate medical LLMs. CMB consists of two parts - CMB-Exam containing multiple choice questions, and CMB-Clin containing clinical diagnostic questions. 2. Motivation: Existing medical benchmarks are either in English or do not sufficiently cover the unique characteristics of Chinese medicine. The authors argue for the need to create a localized benchmark rooted in the native Chinese linguistic and medical context.3. Approach: CMB-Exam leverages real exam questions spanning various medical professions and difficulty levels. CMB-Clin uses textbook case studies to assess clinical diagnostic and reasoning skills. The benchmark is designed to provide fine-grained feedback and analyze model capabilities across knowledge areas.4. Experiments: The paper benchmarks prominent LLMs on CMB-Exam and CMB-Clin. It analyzes model performance across specialties, decoding strategies, few-shot prompts, and compares results to expert evaluation. 5. Key observations: The results reveal GPT-4's significant superiority, the need for better medical LLMs, performance disparities across knowledge areas like Chinese vs Western medicine, and effectiveness of evaluation strategies.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a localized, comprehensive Chinese medical benchmark is required to effectively evaluate the progression of medical LLMs, which this work aims to address through the proposed CMB dataset and experiments.
