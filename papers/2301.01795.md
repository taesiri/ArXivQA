# [PACO: Parts and Attributes of Common Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01795)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to construct and evaluate a dataset with rich annotations of objects, parts, and attributes. Specifically, the authors aim to design a dataset that:- Provides part masks and attributes for common objects beyond just object masks and labels.- Enables benchmarking of joint object, part, and attribute prediction. - Allows evaluating the usefulness of parts and attributes for downstream tasks like zero-shot instance detection.To address this, the paper introduces the PACO dataset which contains:- Part masks for 456 object-part categories across 75 common objects.- Object and part attribute annotations for 55 attributes.  - Instance ID annotations to enable few-shot experiments.The key contributions are:1) The PACO dataset with richer annotations compared to prior datasets.2) Novel evaluation protocols and metrics for benchmarking part segmentation, attribute prediction, and zero-shot instance detection on this data.3) Analysis of simple baseline methods on the new benchmarks to calibrate future research.Overall, the core hypothesis is that richer annotations like part masks and attributes are crucial for detailed understanding of objects. The PACO dataset and benchmarks are designed to facilitate research in this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The introduction of PACO, a new dataset for parts, attributes and common objects. PACO contains object masks, part masks, object attributes, and part attributes annotated on images from LVIS and videos from Ego4D. 2. The dataset contains 260K object instances with 641K part masks covering 456 object-part categories. Around half of these instances are also annotated with 55 attributes.3. Three benchmark tasks are introduced on PACO to evaluate joint part segmentation, attribute prediction, and zero-shot instance detection using part and attribute queries.4. Simple extensions of Mask R-CNN and ViT-Det models are provided as baselines for the benchmark tasks.5. The dataset construction involves careful considerations regarding evaluation setup and metrics to enable rigorous benchmarking with missing labels and federated annotations.6. The paper demonstrates that PACO can enable research on richer object understanding tasks beyond standard detection, including part-based instance retrieval.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of the PACO dataset to facilitate research on joint object, part and attribute modeling for common object categories. The paper also provides benchmark tasks, baseline models and evaluation protocols to calibrate future research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces PACO, a new dataset for joint object detection, part segmentation, and attribute recognition. The key contributions are:1. PACO provides detailed part and attribute annotations for common objects across both images (LVIS) and videos (Ego4D).2. The authors design benchmarks for part segmentation, attribute prediction, and zero-shot instance detection using the dataset.3. Simple Mask R-CNN and ViT-based models are trained on PACO to provide baseline results for future research. 4. The dataset enables richer scene understanding beyond coarse object detection, advancing progress in areas like open vocabulary detection and visual question answering.In summary, PACO is a large-scale dataset to facilitate research on fine-grained object understanding through parts, attributes and their relationships. It provides data and rigorous benchmarks to drive progress beyond traditional object detection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:- The paper introduces a new dataset called PACO for the tasks of part and attribute detection for common objects. This fills an important gap, as most prior datasets for parts/attributes focus on specific domains like fashion or birds, not everyday objects. PACO provides richer annotations at scale compared to related datasets like ADE20K and PartImageNet.- The tasks of part segmentation and attribute prediction are formulated in a practical joint detection setup which requires predicting objects, parts, and attributes together. This differs from some prior work like attribute datasets that assume objects are given. It is also more challenging than standalone part segmentation datasets.- For evaluation, the paper carefully adapts object detection metrics like AP to the tasks of part and attribute detection. This is non-trivial due to missing labels and federated annotation style. The paper shows how to modify AP calculation to handle this.- The zero-shot instance detection task is uniquely enabled by PACO's joint object-part-attribute annotations. This moves beyond referring expressions to enable richer attribute-based queries. The paper provides a robust evaluation protocol for this new task.- Simple adapted Mask R-CNN baselines are provided for all tasks to make it easy for future work to build on PACO. The models and code are open-sourced.Overall, PACO pushes research on detailed object understanding using parts and attributes in a practical joint detection setup. The tasks, dataset scale, evaluation protocols, and baseline models are a significant contribution compared to prior disconnected efforts on parts and attributes.
