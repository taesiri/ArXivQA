# [PACO: Parts and Attributes of Common Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01795)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to construct and evaluate a dataset with rich annotations of objects, parts, and attributes. Specifically, the authors aim to design a dataset that:- Provides part masks and attributes for common objects beyond just object masks and labels.- Enables benchmarking of joint object, part, and attribute prediction. - Allows evaluating the usefulness of parts and attributes for downstream tasks like zero-shot instance detection.To address this, the paper introduces the PACO dataset which contains:- Part masks for 456 object-part categories across 75 common objects.- Object and part attribute annotations for 55 attributes.  - Instance ID annotations to enable few-shot experiments.The key contributions are:1) The PACO dataset with richer annotations compared to prior datasets.2) Novel evaluation protocols and metrics for benchmarking part segmentation, attribute prediction, and zero-shot instance detection on this data.3) Analysis of simple baseline methods on the new benchmarks to calibrate future research.Overall, the core hypothesis is that richer annotations like part masks and attributes are crucial for detailed understanding of objects. The PACO dataset and benchmarks are designed to facilitate research in this direction.
