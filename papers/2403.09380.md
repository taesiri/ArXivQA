# [Impact of Synthetic Images on Morphing Attack Detection Using a Siamese   Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Morphing attacks on face recognition systems are a threat for border control applications. Developing robust morphing attack detection (MAD) systems is challenging due to the lack of large databases with enough bona fide and morphed images. Most current MAD systems are trained and tested on synthetic databases which may not generalize well to real operational scenarios with digital face images. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper evaluates the impact of using purely synthetic face images to train a MAD system based on a Siamese neural network. Cross-dataset evaluations are performed between synthetic and digital face benchmarks. 

- Different pre-trained networks - MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, EfficientNetB0 - are explored as feature extractors. A semi-hard triplet loss is used for training to better separate different morphed images of the same subject pair.

- Four experiments are conducted: 1) Train and test on synthetic (SYN-MAD) data, 2) Train on synthetic, test on digital data, 3) Vice versa, 4) Mix synthetic and digital data for training, test on benchmark.

Main Contributions:

- State-of-the-art performance achieved on the SYN-MAD benchmark by the proposed Siamese network method trained solely on synthetic data.

- Experiments show training on only synthetic data does not transfer well to digital data. However, training on digital data generalizes decently to synthetic test data.

- Mixing even 20% digital data with synthetic database for training significantly boosts generalization ability and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art on the benchmark.

- More work still required for synthetic databases and algorithms to match performance of systems trained on digital data for operational MAD scenarios. The paper provides useful analysis and insights on this problem.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive study on using synthetic vs. digital face data to train MAD systems, through multiple experiments and cross-dataset testing strategies. Key results highlight the current limitations but also future scope of improvement for synthetically-trained MAD.
