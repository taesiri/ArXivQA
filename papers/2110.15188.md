# [The magnitude vector of images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15188)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can the concept of "magnitude" from topological data analysis be applied to images, by viewing each image as its own metric space? 

2) What are the properties of the "magnitude vector" when applied to images? In particular, can it be used for edge detection in images?

3) Can efficient approximations and algorithms be developed to make magnitude computations tractable on high-resolution images? 

4) Can a "magnitude model" be developed that combines a learnable metric on images with efficient magnitude vector computation to perform edge detection? How does this compare to existing edge detection methods?

Specifically, the authors aim to formalize the notion of a magnitude vector for images, investigate its theoretical properties, develop efficient computational approximations, and propose a new magnitude-based model for edge detection. A core hypothesis is that the magnitude vector will exhibit edge detection abilities analogous to detecting boundaries in topological spaces. Experiments are conducted to validate the magnitude approximations, evaluate the edge detection capabilities, and compare the topological properties of magnitude-based edges to existing methods like Sobel filters. Overall, the goal is to explore whether magnitude can be a useful concept and tool for machine learning on images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Formalizing the concept of magnitude and magnitude vectors for images, treating each image as a compact metric space. The paper derives theoretical results for 1D images and approximations for 2D images.

- Showing theoretically that the magnitude vector can perform edge detection in images, by linking magnitude vectors to the previous notion of detecting boundaries in metric spaces. 

- Proposing efficient approximations to make magnitude vector computation feasible on images, overcoming a key computational hurdle.

- Introducing a novel "magnitude model" architecture that combines a learnable metric on images with an efficient magnitude vector approximation. Experiments demonstrate this model can perform edge detection comparably to standard methods like Sobel filters.

- Analyzing the topological properties of edges detected by the magnitude model compared to other methods like Sobel. The magnitude model exhibits substantially more cycles and connected components, suggesting it captures different structural information.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be formalizing magnitude vectors for images, showing edge detection abilities theoretically, making the computation tractable, and demonstrating practical machine learning applications with the magnitude model for edge detection. The paper provides both theoretical grounding and practical applications for using magnitude in machine learning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of magnitude methods for machine learning:

- The main contribution of this paper is introducing the concept of magnitude vectors for images and using them for edge detection. Other papers have explored magnitude for machine learning, but primarily for topological data analysis on point cloud datasets. Applying magnitude vectors to images and for edge detection is novel.

- The paper provides theoretical analysis of magnitude vectors on 1D and 2D images, deriving analytical forms in some cases. This provides a more rigorous footing compared to some other applied papers that use magnitude approaches. However, the theoretical results are limited to some simplified image types. 

- For applications, the paper focuses on using magnitude for edge detection in images. This is compared against standard methods like Sobel filters and Canny edge detection. The results are decent but not state-of-the-art. More recent papers have pushed magnitude-based methods further for image processing tasks.

- The proposed magnitude model with a learnable metric is interesting but fairly basic. It uses a simple autoencoder architecture. More advanced deep metric learning approaches have since been applied for learning metrics for magnitude computations.

- The approximations for efficient magnitude vector computation are useful but not compared to other possible speed-up methods. Recent work has focused more on parallelizing magnitude computations on GPUs for efficiency.

- Overall, this paper provides a good introduction to magnitude vectors for images with some theoretical analysis and proofs-of-concept applications. But it represents an early stage of this research area. Follow up papers have advanced magnitude-based methods for computer vision using more sophisticated models and metrics. The theoretical understanding also remains limited.

In summary, this paper presents important foundational work introducing magnitude to image analysis. But substantial progress has been made since that builds on these ideas and concepts. The paper serves more as a launching point for an interesting new research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Further exploring approximations for the magnitude computation to avoid the need for matrix inversion, which makes magnitude calculation computationally intensive. The authors mention this could lead to more theoretical advances.

- Additional experimental research optimizing the autoencoder architecture and feature extractors used in the magnitude model for edge detection. The authors note careful optimization here could substantially improve performance. 

- Investigating ways to incorporate non-local pixel information into the magnitude model, rather than just local pixel embeddings. The authors suggest this could help match the performance of modern convolutional neural networks.

- Evaluating the magnitude vector and models on more complex image datasets beyond the BIPED dataset used in this work.

- Considering other potential use cases for the magnitude vector and associated models in machine learning, beyond edge detection. The descriptive abilities of magnitude suggest it may be useful for other applications as well.

- Further exploration of theoretical properties of the magnitude measure for images, building on the analytical results obtained in this paper for 1D and approximate 2D cases.

So in summary, the main future directions relate to finding more efficient computation methods, optimizing and extending the magnitude model architectures, evaluating on more complex datasets, finding new applications, and further theoretical investigation. The authors lay good groundwork and suggest magnitude shows promise for machine learning.
