# [The magnitude vector of images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15188)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can the concept of "magnitude" from topological data analysis be applied to images, by viewing each image as its own metric space? 2) What are the properties of the "magnitude vector" when applied to images? In particular, can it be used for edge detection in images?3) Can efficient approximations and algorithms be developed to make magnitude computations tractable on high-resolution images? 4) Can a "magnitude model" be developed that combines a learnable metric on images with efficient magnitude vector computation to perform edge detection? How does this compare to existing edge detection methods?Specifically, the authors aim to formalize the notion of a magnitude vector for images, investigate its theoretical properties, develop efficient computational approximations, and propose a new magnitude-based model for edge detection. A core hypothesis is that the magnitude vector will exhibit edge detection abilities analogous to detecting boundaries in topological spaces. Experiments are conducted to validate the magnitude approximations, evaluate the edge detection capabilities, and compare the topological properties of magnitude-based edges to existing methods like Sobel filters. Overall, the goal is to explore whether magnitude can be a useful concept and tool for machine learning on images.
