# [Training Neural Networks with Internal State, Unconstrained   Connectivity, and Discrete Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current state-of-the-art machine learning models like large language models (LLMs) are stateless, meaning their outputs depend only on current inputs without memory of past inputs. 
- Biological brains maintain internal state and memory. An open question is whether the limitations of current AI models (e.g. hallucination, susceptibility to adversarial attacks) stems from their lack of internal state.
- Existing stateful models like recurrent neural networks have lagged far behind stateless transformer models. But this does not mean stateful approaches are less powerful - we may just not have the right algorithms yet for effectively training them.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper explores a simple stateful model with binary activations and only a single weight matrix, without predefined layers or constraints. 
- The model has an input layer (current input + state) connected to a hidden state layer. A weight matrix maps input layer to next hidden state. Its transpose maps hidden state back to reconstruct previous input and state.
- Reconstruction error is used as training signal to adjust weights with a local, non gradient-based rule. Additional rules update biases for sparsity.
- Model is trained in unsupervised manner on sequences of text from news articles. Resulting internal states over sequences form feature vectors for a classifier.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates a model that is stateful, has minimal constraints, discrete activations, and non-gradient based training, yet still forms useful representations for 82.2% text classification accuracy.
- Discusses ideas to improve training convergence to leverage more data.
- Analyzes potential benefits like stability, robustness, interpretability that could arise from effective stateful models, and suggests experiments to evaluate these.
- Overall explores a promising direction toward stateful models and alternative training algorithms on them, as a step toward more human-like intelligence.
