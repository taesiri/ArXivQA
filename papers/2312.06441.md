# [Revisiting Graph-based Fraud Detection in Sight of Heterophily and   Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06441)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new semi-supervised graph neural network model called SEC-GFD for fraud detection on highly heterophilic graphs. Heterophily refers to how connected nodes tend to have different labels, which is common in fraud scenarios. The model has two main components:

1) A hybrid filtering module that decomposes the graph spectrum into multiple frequency bands and performs message passing on each band separately before aggregating. This allows comprehensive representation learning that adapts to heterophily by capturing both high and low frequency signals.

2) A local environmental constraint module that enhances connections between a node's label and features of its local neighborhood. This improves label utilization during training. An InfoNCE-like contrastive loss is used to constrain normal nodes to have consistent surroundings while anomalies have diverging contexts.

Experiments on four real-world heterophilic graph datasets for fraud detection demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies validate the contributions of the key components. Further analysis examines the effect of clipping heterophily edges with different graph filters. The order of high-frequency neighbor signals is also explored. The method outperforms strong baseline GNN models overall, indicating the benefits of explicitly handling challenges introduced by heterophily.
