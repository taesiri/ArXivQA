# [Is it Possible to Edit Large Language Models Robustly?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are pivotal for building communicative AI agents that can imitate human behaviors. However, efficiently customizing LLMs remains challenging. 
- Recent "model editing" methods manipulate LLMs' memories to change their language generation related to target knowledge, but their robustness is questionable.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:  
- The paper conducts extensive analysis to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods for realistic applications of communicative AI. Main research questions addressed:
  - Q1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? 
  - Q2: To what extent do rephrased prompts make LLMs deviate from edited knowledge?
  - Q3: Which knowledge features correlate with editing performance and robustness?

- Key Findings:
  - There is a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and practical application requirements. Edited LLMs easily get confused and hallucinate.
  - Editing performance significantly declines on complex/flexible prompts common in real applications.
  - More popular knowledge is better memorized, easier recalled, but harder to robustly edit.
  
- Proposed analysis methods:
  - Test edited communicative AI in dialogs to reveal confusion and hallucination risks (Q1).
  - Design "attacks" via rephrased prompts to evaluate robustness (Q2).
  - Quantify knowledge popularity from frequency, connections and co-occurrence to study correlations (Q3).

- The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of strengths and weaknesses of editing methods, facilitating more robust applications of communicative AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically studies the robustness of large language model editing methods in realistic situations, finding substantial disparities from existing benchmarks and that more popular knowledge tends to be better memorized but harder to robustly edit.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is systematically studying the robustness of recent language model editing methods in practical situations. Specifically:

1) It shows that edited large language models can still exhibit confusion and hallucination when deployed as communicative AI agents in realistic dialogues. 

2) It designs several "attack" methods to rephrase prompts to more complex variants to probe the robustness of edited models, finding significant declines in performance.

3) It analyzes how intrinsic knowledge features like popularity affect editing difficulty and vulnerability to attacks, finding more popular knowledge is better memorized, easier to recall, but harder to robustly edit.

Overall, the paper uncovers a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and practical application requirements, highlighting the need for more research into making editing more robust for realistic uses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Model editing - The core focus of the paper is analyzing and evaluating methods for editing/updating the knowledge stored in large language models without full retraining.

- Communicative AI - The paper examines model editing in the context of using edited models for conversational agents and other interactive AI applications.

- Robustness - A central theme is assessing the robustness and consistency of edited models when faced with realistic, flexible inputs. 

- Knowledge features - The paper analyzes how properties like frequency, connectivity, and co-occurrence affect the difficulty of editing knowledge.

- Rephrasing - Testing edited models on rephrased inputs that preserve semantics but change surface form.

- Confusion and hallucination - Phenomena observed when edited models are inconsistently queried on related knowledge.

- Benchmarks - Use of datasets like CounterFact and zsRE to systematically evaluate performance.

So in summary, key terms cover model editing methods, evaluation, knowledge representation, robustness testing, conversational AI applications, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes several "attack" methods to test the robustness of edited large language models when deployed as conversational agents. Could you elaborate on the motivation behind designing these attacks and how they simulate real-world usage of edited models? 

2. One attack method involves rephrasing the prompts into more complex versions while retaining semantics. What techniques did you use to automate the rephrasing? How did you ensure the rephrasings are natural and flexibly cover common realistic situations?

3. For the analysis of knowledge popularity features, how exactly did you measure frequency, connection strength, and co-occurrence empirically? What datasets and knowledge graphs were leveraged? What were some challenges faced?

4. You found editing more popular knowledge is more difficult and prone to failure when prompts are rephrased. What intrinsic properties of popular knowledge make editing trickier? How can this guide future research to edit robustly?  

5. You showed edited models can become confused or hallucinate when questions approach intersections with other related knowledge. What underlying reasons in models cause this behavior? How can it be addressed algorithmically?

6. The paper focuses on editing declarative factual knowledge. How do you think the robustness conclusions might differ for subjective, ambiguous, or procedural knowledge editing? Are the attacks still effective?

7. For the model-based methods like ROME and MEMIT, what specific model components are being exploited? How do the methods locate target knowledge and change behavior on related prompts? 

8. How were the external memory module in SERAC and hypernetwork in MEND designed and optimized? What are their advantages and weaknesses observed in the attacks?

9. You found IKE's prompt-based editing exhibits greater robustness. Why does explicitly controlling generation through prompts outperform directly editing model parameters? What are prompts' limitations?

10. What are your views on how evaluation of editing methods should progress to ensure they work reliably in real applications like conversational agents? What new datasets, metrics, or protocols can help?
