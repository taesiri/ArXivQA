# [Deep Outdated Fact Detection in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Deep Outdated Fact Detection in Knowledge Graphs":

Problem:
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are prone to containing outdated facts over time as the real-world entities and relations they represent evolve. Detecting these outdated facts is crucial for maintaining the quality and usefulness of KGs. However, existing solutions rely heavily on manual recognition and do not fully consider the implicit structural information between facts. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called DEAN (Deep outdatEd fAct detectioN) to automatically detect outdated facts in KGs. The key ideas are:

(1) Capture implicit structure of KGs: Employ graph attention to learn expressive representations of entities and relations by modeling their interactions.

(2) Contrastive learning: Design a contrastive module based on a pre-defined weighted Relations-to-Nodes (R2N) graph to better distinguish between outdated and non-outdated facts.

(3) Classification: Use a binary classifier on top of the learned representations to detect outdated facts.

Main Contributions:

(1) Problem formulation: Formally define the problem of outdated fact detection in KGs.

(2) Innovative solution: Propose a novel deep learning framework DEAN incorporating graph attention and contrastive learning for effective outdated fact detection. 

(3) Comprehensive evaluation: Conduct extensive experiments on 6 datasets to demonstrate DEAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

(4) In-depth analysis: Provide detailed analysis on the model design and parameters to offer useful insights.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in tackling the practical outdated fact detection problem in KGs with a specialized deep learning solution.
