# [Can Large Language Models Infer Causation from Correlation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05836)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can large language models infer causation from correlation?

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel task called "correlation-to-causation inference" (Corr2Cause) to probe and benchmark the pure causal inference abilities of large language models. The key hypothesis is that current LLMs may not perform well on inferring causality purely from correlational statements, without relying on empirical knowledge.

To test this hypothesis, the authors:

- Formulate the Corr2Cause task, which takes correlational statements as input and determines the causal relationship between variables. 

- Create a dataset of over 400K examples following principles from causal discovery research.

- Evaluate 17 existing LLMs on this dataset and find they perform poorly, close to random guess levels.

- Explore finetuning LLMs on this dataset, showing improved performance but lack of out-of-distribution generalization.

In summary, the main research question is whether LLMs can perform pure causal inference given only correlational statements. The key finding is that current LLMs lack this reasoning skill, motivating further research into improving LLMs' abilities for causal reasoning. The Corr2Cause dataset provides a valuable benchmark for this line of research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task and dataset to test the pure causal inference abilities of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- The paper formulates a novel task called "correlation-to-causation inference" (Corr2Cause), which involves inferring causality purely from correlational statements, without relying on empirical knowledge. 

- The authors compose a large-scale dataset with over 400K examples for this task, using insights from causal discovery research to systematically generate correlation statements and causal hypotheses.

- The paper evaluates 17 existing LLMs on this dataset and shows they perform poorly, close to random guess levels. This demonstrates a key limitation of current LLMs' reasoning abilities.

- The authors further explore whether LLMs can learn this skill by finetuning on the dataset. Finetuned models achieve high accuracy on the original test set but fail to generalize to out-of-distribution perturbations of the test set.

- This is the first benchmark dataset and set of experiments probing the pure causal inference abilities of LLMs. The authors argue this is an important reasoning skill for LLMs to have and that their dataset can motivate further research to improve LLMs in this aspect.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new task and dataset to measure and improve LLMs' skills at inferring causality purely from correlational data/statements, without relying on empirical knowledge. This tests an important aspect of reasoning that is currently limited in LLMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in causal inference and reasoning in NLP:

- It proposes a new task, Corr2Cause, that focuses specifically on pure causal reasoning from correlation statements. Most prior work has focused on inferring causality from empirical knowledge rather than formal reasoning principles. This is the first dataset to directly test models' correlation-to-causation inference abilities.

- The dataset is large-scale, with over 400K samples generated in a principled way based on concepts from causal discovery research. Many existing causal inference datasets in NLP tend to be small-scale or built in a less systematic manner.

- The paper finds that current LLMs perform very poorly on this pure causal inference task, close to random chance levels. This suggests existing models have limited reasoning abilities despite their strong performance on many NLP benchmarks. 

- The robustness experiments reveal LLMs fail to generalize their causal skills to out-of-distribution data, even after finetuning. This highlights issues with spurious pattern matching rather than robust causal learning.

- The paper focuses on causal graphs with a small number of variables. Scaling up the complexity could be an interesting direction for future work.

Overall, this paper makes a strong contribution in identifying and quantifying an important missing capability in current LLMs - the ability to do pure causal reasoning. The task and dataset enable targeted investigation of this skill. The poor performance highlights important limitations of current models and the need for advances in causal learning and robust reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring larger graphs with more than 6 nodes. The authors limited their causal graphs to 2-6 nodes, but suggest future work could generate datasets with larger graphs.

- Generating datasets that assume hidden confounders. The authors did not include hidden confounders in their graphs. They suggest future work could create more challenging datasets that require inferring the existence of hidden confounders, similar to the FCI algorithm. 

- Connecting the dataset to real-world examples of false beliefs from confusing correlation and causation. The authors were motivated by invalid reasoning patterns that lead to false beliefs. They suggest future work could connect this benchmark dataset to more real-world examples of people making incorrect causal inferences.

- Studying the effect of in-context learning when querying the models. The authors suggest exploring if providing examples in the context for the models improves performance.

- Adding more signals to the context to guide the models, such as explicitly stating rules of causal inference.

- Analyzing example chains of reasoning that models use on these questions to better understand their inference process.

In summary, key future directions include expanding the scope and complexity of the graphs and datasets, connecting the task closer to real-world reasoning, and analyzing model performance more deeply through in-context learning, adding signals to guide the models, and inspecting full reasoning chains. The authors propose this as a first step and encourage future work to build on this causal inference benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task called correlation-to-causation inference (Corr2Cause) to test the pure causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors generate a dataset of over 400K examples where a correlation statement between variables is paired with a hypothesis proposing a causal relationship. The examples are generated using principles from causal discovery to ensure a rigorous mapping between correlations and causality. Experiments on 17 LLMs show they perform poorly on this pure reasoning task. While finetuning improves performance, models fail to generalize on out-of-distribution test sets generated via paraphrasing and variable name changes. The authors conclude existing LLMs lack robust causal reasoning skills, and the Corr2Cause dataset provides a challenging benchmark to motivate improving this core AI capability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new task called correlation-to-causation inference (Corr2Cause), which tests the ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer causality from correlational statements. The authors argue that pure causal reasoning is an important but missing capability of LLMs. To systematically test this, they generate a dataset of over 400K examples mapping correlations to underlying causal relations, grounding the data generation process in principles from causal discovery research. 

The authors evaluate 17 LLMs on Corr2Cause and find that none perform well, achieving close to random guess levels. They also explore whether LLMs can learn the skill by finetuning on the dataset. Although finetuned models achieve high accuracy, their performance significantly drops on simple perturbations like paraphrasing and changing variable names, indicating they have not robustly learned the skill. Overall, the paper identifies a major weakness of current LLMs in causal reasoning and provides a challenging benchmark to guide future work on improving LLMs' reasoning abilities. The data and code are made publicly available.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new task called Correlation-to-Causation Inference (Corr2Cause), which involves inferring causality from correlations described in text. To generate a dataset for this task, the authors start by programmatically generating all possible directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with 2 to 6 nodes, which represent causal structures between variables. They then use concepts from causal discovery like d-separation to derive the set of conditional independence facts that would arise from each DAG, allowing them to cluster the DAGs into Markov equivalence classes (MECs) that encode the same set of statistical correlations. For each MEC, they generate textual premises describing the correlations and hypotheses proposing possible causal relationships between two variables, labeling them as valid or invalid based on whether the relationship holds across all DAGs in the MEC. This results in a dataset of over 400k examples grounded in formal causal inference principles, which can be used to evaluate whether language models have learned to reliably infer causation from textual correlation statements.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new task and dataset for testing whether large language models can perform pure causal inference to determine causality from correlation, and finds that current LLMs still struggle at this reasoning skill.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of evaluating whether large language models (LLMs) can perform pure causal inference, i.e. inferring causation directly from correlation without relying on empirical knowledge. The key research questions the paper investigates are:

1. How well do existing LLMs perform on pure causal inference? 

2. Can existing LLMs be re-trained or re-purposed to obtain robust causal inference skills?

Specifically, the paper introduces a new task called "correlation-to-causation inference" (Corr2Cause) that tests an LLM's ability to determine whether it is valid to infer a causal relationship between two variables based on a correlational statement. The authors curate a dataset of over 400k examples for this task, grounded in principles from causal discovery research. 

The paper evaluates 17 existing LLMs on the Corr2Cause dataset and finds they perform poorly, close to random baseline levels. It also explores fine-tuning LLMs on the dataset, showing they can achieve high accuracy but fail to generalize robustly on out-of-distribution test cases.

Overall, the key contribution is identifying and evaluating pure causal inference as a missing capability in current LLMs through the novel Corr2Cause task and dataset. The paper suggests this is an important direction for future research to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new task called "correlation-to-causation inference" (Corr2Cause) to test the pure causal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors created a dataset of over 400K samples grounded in causal discovery principles to determine if an LLM can validly infer causation from correlation statements. Seventeen major LLMs were evaluated, and none performed well, achieving close to random guess performance. The authors then explored finetuning LLMs on this dataset and found performance increased drastically, with RoBERTa-Large MNLI reaching 94.74% F1 score. However, further tests revealed these skills did not robustly generalize - when variables were renamed or hypotheses were paraphrased, performance dropped substantially. Overall, the paper identifies a key reasoning weakness of current LLMs, their inability to reliably perform pure causal inference. The new Corr2Cause dataset provides a rigorous benchmark to measure progress on this core aspect of intelligence. Finetuning helps gain skills on distribution but better techniques are needed for out-of-distribution generalization.
