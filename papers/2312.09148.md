## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Split-Ensemble: Efficient OOD-aware Ensemble via Task and Model Splitting":

Problem Statement
- Deep learning models can make unreliable predictions when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. However, improving model robustness typically requires additional data or computation (e.g. ensembles). 

- Existing methods have drawbacks:
    - Ensemble models improve uncertainty estimation but require large additional compute
    - Single model methods require outlier exposure training data which may be unavailable

Key Idea
- Propose a Split-Ensemble method to improve OOD detection without needing additional data or computation
- Key ideas:
    1. Split the original classification task into complementary subtasks 
    2. Train a submodel on each subtask using other subtasks' data as proxy OOD data
    3. Share low-level features across submodels & use light architectures to avoid overhead
    4. Iteratively split and prune model into a tree-like architecture based on subtask correlations

Contributions  
1. A subtask splitting objective for OOD-aware ensemble training without external outlier data
2. An automated splitting and pruning algorithm to build an efficient tree-like Split-Ensemble architecture
3. Empirical evaluation showing Split-Ensemble improves OOD detection over single model baselines and outperforms larger ensemble models, without additional compute costs

Outcome
- On CIFAR and TinyImageNet, Split-Ensemble improves accuracy over single model, surpassing ensemble baselines
- On same datasets, Split-Ensemble improves OOD detection (AUROC) over single model by 2.2-29.6% 

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach using task splitting and model splitting to train an efficient OOD-aware ensemble without needing additional data or computation. Both accuracy and OOD detection are improved.
