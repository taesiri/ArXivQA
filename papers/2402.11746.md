# [Language Models are Homer Simpson! Safety Re-Alignment of Fine-tuned   Language Models through Task Arithmetic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11746)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a simple yet effective method called RESTA to restore the safety of language models compromised due to fine-tuning, by adding back safety vectors obtained from an aligned model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective method called RESTA (REstoring Safety through Task Arithmetic) to restore the safety of language models that has been compromised due to fine-tuning. The key idea is to add a precomputed safety vector to the parameters of the fine-tuned model to compensate for the loss in safety. The paper also introduces a new multilingual dataset called CatQA with 550 harmful questions in English, Chinese and Vietnamese to evaluate language model safety across different categories of harm. Experiments using RESTA show significant reductions in model harmfulness across languages and fine-tuning methods, with minimal impact on performance. The simplicity and effectiveness of RESTA makes it an appealing technique for restoring safety in fine-tuned language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Safety re-alignment - The paper proposes a method called RESTA to restore the safety of fine-tuned language models that may have become compromised or misaligned. 

- Task arithmetic - The RESTA method is based on the concept of task arithmetic, where model behaviors can be edited by adding or subtracting task-specific vector directions.

- Fine-tuning - The paper examines how both parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning of models can lead to reduced safety, even on benign datasets.

- Drop and rescale (DARE) - A technique proposed to remove redundant fine-tuning delta parameters before re-aligning model safety. 

- Categorical harmfulness - The paper introduces a new multilingual dataset, CatQA, to evaluate model safety across 11 categories and subcategories of potential harm.

- Safety vector - The core vector that encapsulates model safety and which RESTA adds back to fine-tuned models to restore compromised safety.

So in summary - safety re-alignment, task arithmetic, fine-tuning, DARE, categorical harmfulness, and the safety vector are key concepts and terms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does Resta leverage task vectors computed from the difference between the aligned and unaligned model to restore safety? Could other methods for computing safety vectors also work?

2) The paper mentions using DARE (Drop And Rescale) to remove redundant delta parameters before applying Resta. What is the intuition behind why removing redundant task-specific parameters enhances Resta's effectiveness? 

3) Resta seems to work well for both parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning regimes. Does the effectiveness vary across model sizes or domains? Are there cases where Resta does not help significantly?

4) The computed safety vectors appear to generalize well to unseen categories of harm and even across languages. What properties of these vectors enable such cross-domain generalization?

5) Could the effectiveness of Resta be further improved by iteratively applying it multiple times or using an ensemble of safety vectors from diverse unalignment methods?

6) How does the performance vs safety tradeoff curve look when varying the amount of added safety vectors? Is there a sweet spot that balances both well?

7) The drop rate hyperparameter p seems to impact Resta's effectiveness differently for PEFT vs full fine-tuning. How could this be analyzed further to find optimal values of p?

8) Are there any theoretical guarantees for Resta in terms of provably reducing model harm while approximately preserving performance?

9) The safety scores used rely on automated labeling which can be noisy. How robust are the observed safety improvements to errors in the underlying harm judgments? 

10) Beyond supervised fine-tuning, how could Resta be extended to other training methodologies like reinforcement learning which may also compromise safety?
