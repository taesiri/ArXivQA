# [A Constructive Method for Designing Safe Multirate Controllers for   Differentially-Flat Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18015)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of controlling nonlinear dynamical systems to safely navigate constrained environments in real-time. While approaches exist for motion planning and tracking control separately, combining them to provide formal guarantees on feasibility and safety in the presence of disturbances poses difficulties. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel multi-rate control architecture with two components:
1) A high-level finite-time optimal control problem (FTOCP) that runs model predictive control (MPC) on the linearized dynamics to generate optimal reference trajectories.
2) A low-level tracking controller that ensures the nonlinear system follows the reference trajectory from (1) using input-to-state stability concepts.  

The key novelty is in constructively designing the two components to enable formal guarantees:
- Safety: The tracking error is bounded within a set used to tighten constraints for the MPC. This ensures the nonlinear state remains within original safe sets despite disturbances.
- Recursive Feasibility: The tracking error bound is used to define the initial condition constraint in the MPC to maintain feasibility.

Additionally, leveraging differential flatness theory enables a constructive procedure to design the controller without complex Lyapunov function searches or extensive system discretization.


Contributions:
1) A novel multi-rate architecture that couples the high-level planner with low-level tracking for formal safety and recursive feasibility guarantees.

2) A constructive control design procedure enabled by exploiting differential flatness. This removes the need for function searches or approximations.

3) Demonstrated simulation and experimental results on a quadrupedal robot and ground rover showing the efficacy of the proposed architecture. The experiments validate the real-time capabilities and robustness claims.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in developing a principled approach to combine planning and control for nonlinear systems, with provable guarantees. The constructive nature and experimental validations demonstrate the practical utility of the method.
