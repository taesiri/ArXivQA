# [Citation Amnesia: NLP and Other Academic Fields Are in a Citation Age   Recession](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines the tendency for academic papers across 20 fields to cite older work over a 43 year period (1980-2023). The goal is to analyze whether NLP shows similar temporal citation patterns to other fields or if differences can be observed.

The analysis is based on a dataset of ~240 million papers. It reveals a broader scientific trend - many fields have markedly declined in citing older works in recent years (e.g. psychology, computer science). The authors term this a 'citation age recession', analogous to economic recessions. 

The decline is strongest in NLP and machine learning research. NLP citations to papers >10 years old peaked around 2015 and have since dropped 12.8%. Machine learning dropped 5.5% from its peak.  

The results suggest the decline is not solely driven by growth in publication volumes, which has risen just 3.4% on average across fields. Even controlling for volume, there is a disproportionate tendency to cite more recent work.

Beyond NLP and machine learning, fields like linguistics, math, psychology and sociology have also shown recent drops in citations to older literature. This points to a broader shift in engagement with historical research.

The paper situates NLP's citation patterns within 20 fields over 43 years to gain perspective. NLP has the lowest average citation age at 9.44 years. Other key findings show NLP focuses more on recent computer science literature compared to older, relevant works from other fields. 

The results raise questions around the potential consequences of neglecting older but still relevant research, particularly for fast-moving fields like NLP that influence other domains. The paper calls for more inclusive engagement with diverse literature across time and fields.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper examines the tendency across 20 fields over 43 years to cite older work, revealing a broader scientific trend of declining engagement with older research, with the steepest drop in natural language processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper provides a broad analysis across 20 fields over 43 years examining the tendency to cite older work. It shows that many fields, especially NLP and ML, have experienced a marked decline in the average age of cited papers since around 2015, which the authors term a "citation age recession". The paper situates NLP's citation patterns within broader trends across academic fields, revealing NLP's particularly strong drop of 12.8% in citations to papers over 10 years old. It also introduces metrics to quantify citation age diversity and field diversity, uncovering connections between cross-field citations and temporal citations. Overall, the analysis raises concerns about decreasing engagement with older literature across fields and provides recommendations to foster more responsible research practices.

The paper examines temporal citation patterns (how recent or old the cited papers are) both within NLP and across 20 academic fields over 43 years. It introduces the concept of "citation age recession" to refer to the declining tendency of academic papers to cite older works. A key focus is on how NLP papers engage with older literature both from within NLP and other fields like linguistics and computer science. The goal is to encourage more responsible and inclusive research practices by broadening literature review to more diverse works spanning different disciplines and time periods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new metric called Volume-Adjusted Average Citation Age (VACA). How is this metric calculated and what additional insights does it provide compared to just looking at mean average citation age (mAoC)? 

2. When analyzing the correlation between citation volume and citation age (mAoC), the paper examines Pearson correlations. What are some limitations of using Pearson correlations for this analysis? Would other correlation methods like Spearman be more appropriate?

3. For the analysis of shuffling citations over time (Table 2), what are some potential shortcomings of using Spearman rank correlations? Could there be other statistical tests better suited for this research question? 

4. When comparing the citation ages of papers within a field versus outside the field (Figure 5), what are some confounding factors that could influence these age distributions? How could the analysis control for subfield differences?

5. The demo tool allows inputting PDFs and Anthology/Semantic Scholar links to analyze citation age and diversity. What measures are taken to ensure the accuracy of extracted fields and citations from these inputs? How are errors handled?

6. For the analysis of institutions' citation ages (Figure 6), how representative are the selected institutions of broader sectors? What biases could this selection introduce to the comparisons made?

7. Several analyses use mean averages of citation metrics. What are limitations of only considering central tendencies? What additional dispersion statistics could provide further insights?

8. When making historical comparisons of metrics over time, how can concept drift in the labeling of fields in the dataset impact observed longitudinal trends? 

9. What other external factors over time could modulate the observed changes in citation age patterns across fields? Are there any timeseries analyses that control for these?

10. Overall, how sensitive are the observed trends to the OpenAlex dataset itself? What analyses help quantify uncertainty in the results and ensure reproducibility?
