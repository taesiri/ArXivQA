# [Citation Amnesia: NLP and Other Academic Fields Are in a Citation Age   Recession](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines the tendency for academic papers across 20 fields to cite older work over a 43 year period (1980-2023). The goal is to analyze whether NLP shows similar temporal citation patterns to other fields or if differences can be observed.

The analysis is based on a dataset of ~240 million papers. It reveals a broader scientific trend - many fields have markedly declined in citing older works in recent years (e.g. psychology, computer science). The authors term this a 'citation age recession', analogous to economic recessions. 

The decline is strongest in NLP and machine learning research. NLP citations to papers >10 years old peaked around 2015 and have since dropped 12.8%. Machine learning dropped 5.5% from its peak.  

The results suggest the decline is not solely driven by growth in publication volumes, which has risen just 3.4% on average across fields. Even controlling for volume, there is a disproportionate tendency to cite more recent work.

Beyond NLP and machine learning, fields like linguistics, math, psychology and sociology have also shown recent drops in citations to older literature. This points to a broader shift in engagement with historical research.

The paper situates NLP's citation patterns within 20 fields over 43 years to gain perspective. NLP has the lowest average citation age at 9.44 years. Other key findings show NLP focuses more on recent computer science literature compared to older, relevant works from other fields. 

The results raise questions around the potential consequences of neglecting older but still relevant research, particularly for fast-moving fields like NLP that influence other domains. The paper calls for more inclusive engagement with diverse literature across time and fields.
