## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional numerical simulation methods for modeling physical processes have limitations in handling complex real-world scenarios. They rely heavily on predefined equations and initial settings, have high computational costs, and cannot meet real-time prediction demands. Recent physics-informed neural networks also face challenges when applied to noisy prediction tasks in the physical world. Additionally, existing methods focus predominantly on global dynamics while neglecting local fidelity, which is crucial for capturing intricate localized phenomena.

Solution:
This paper proposes PhysicNet, a neural network architecture that combines global and local modeling to capture both holistic trends and granular intricacies of physical processes. The key ideas are:

1) Employ random cropping to generate multi-grained observations including global view and local crops. Adaptive encoders then extract features from these views.

2) Apply vector quantization to identify compact and informative latent representations instead of noise. This neural discrete learning technique acts as an interpretable prior bank.

3) Introduce optical flow estimation modules as general expert components to perceive the motion and evolution of physical processes at both local and global levels.

4) Fuse global and local representations to produce the final outputs. Joint modeling is achieved via careful pipeline design and loss functions.

Contributions:

- Presents an interpretable data-driven framework to uncover important patterns from physical observations while retaining expert knowledge. Significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts across datasets.

- Automatically discovers underlying dynamics and state variables through combination of vector quantization and neural networks. Enhances model expressivity.

- Emphasizes joint global and local modeling of physical processes. Local crops enforce attention to fine details neglected by global view. 

- Optical flow estimation acts as a universal constraint for stability. Ensures smoothness and motion consistency.

The extensive experiments demonstrate PhysicNet's exceptional effectiveness, efficiency, robustness and scalability in complex real-world physical prediction tasks.
