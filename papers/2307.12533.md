# [PUMA: Secure Inference of LLaMA-7B in Five Minutes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12533)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

Could pre-trained large transformer models be securely and efficiently evaluated with similar accuracy as in plaintext, without further retraining?

The authors motivate this question by discussing limitations of prior work on secure inference for transformer models using secure multiparty computation (MPC). They point out that previous methods have drawbacks in terms of model performance, efficiency, and deployment challenges. 

To address this question, the authors propose the Puma framework for fast and accurate secure inference of transformer models in a 3-party setting. The main contributions aim to enable secure computation of large pre-trained transformer models with similar accuracy as plaintext versions, without needing additional model retraining or modifications.

So in summary, the central research question revolves around how to enable efficient and accurate secure inference for large pre-trained transformer models like ChatGPT, without sacrificing performance or needing architectural changes compared to plaintext versions. The Puma framework and its optimizations for functions like GeLU and Softmax are designed to solve this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new MPC framework called Puma for secure inference of Transformer models based on replicated secret sharing. 

2. It designs high quality approximations for expensive functions like GeLU and Softmax to significantly reduce the cost of secure inference while preserving model performance.

3. It proposes secure protocols for Embedding and LayerNorm that faithfully implement the desired functionality without changing the Transformer architecture. 

4. Puma is 2x faster than the state-of-the-art MPCFormer and achieves similar accuracy as plaintext models without extra fine-tuning.

5. Puma can evaluate the large 7B parameter LLaMA model in around 5 minutes per token, which is the first demonstration of such a large model under MPC. 

6. Puma is open-sourced to enable accurate and efficient secure inference of pretrained Transformer models without modification.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end framework called Puma that enables fast and accurate secure inference for Transformer models by designing efficient approximations and protocols while preserving model accuracy and architecture. Puma significantly advances the state-of-the-art in secure ML, allowing large models like LLaMA-7B to be evaluated privately.

The paper proposes a new MPC framework called Puma that enables fast, secure, and accurate inference of large-scale transformer models like LLaMA-7B without compromising accuracy or requiring model retraining.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on enabling secure and efficient inference of Transformer models using multiparty computation (MPC). Other recent works like IronTransformer, MPCformer, PrivTransformer, etc. have also explored using MPC for secure Transformer inference. However, this paper argues that prior works have limitations in model performance, efficiency, and ease of deployment.

- A key contribution of this paper is proposing more accurate approximations of expensive nonlinear functions like GeLU and Softmax that are tailored to their mathematical properties. This allows preserving model accuracy compared to plaintext while reducing computation/communication costs. Other works used more generic approximations like quadratic or ReLU functions which require retraining models.

- The paper designs protocols for secure Embedding and LayerNorm layers to enable compatibility with existing plaintext Transformer models and avoid changing the architecture. Some prior works modified the model architecture which creates deployment obstacles.

- Experiments show Puma matches plaintext model accuracy without retraining and is ~2x faster than MPCformer. Puma is also shown to scale to huge models like LLaMA-7B which has not been done before with MPC.

- The techniques in this paper like function approximations and protocols for Embedding/LayerNorm seem novel compared to prior art. The comprehensive evaluation of both model accuracy and efficiency is more thorough than some related works.

- One limitation is that the threat model considered is semi-honest adversaries. Extending the protocols to be secure against malicious adversaries is an open challenge.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in secure Transformer inference by enabling better accuracy, efficiency, and compatibility than prior works. The practical techniques and implementation are significant contributions to making large language models with MPC more feasible.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more efficient approximations and optimizations for expensive functions like GELU and Softmax to further reduce computation/communication costs of secure inference. The authors mention there is still room for improvement in designing fast and accurate approximations tailored to these functions.

- Exploring quantization and model compression techniques in combination with MPC to improve performance of large Transformer models. The authors note that combining Puma with quantization and hardware acceleration could potentially enable secure inference of huge models in just seconds.

- Supporting additional layers and operations beyond the core Transformer to handle more complex models and tasks. The authors focused on core Transformer operations but note the framework could be extended to support other layers.

- Applying differential privacy techniques on top of MPC to provide formal privacy guarantees against leakage from final outputs. The authors acknowledge MPC protects intermediate computations but not the final outputs. 

- Testing performance on more diverse datasets and models to further validate accuracy and efficiency. The authors evaluated on a decent set of models and tasks but suggest more comprehensive benchmarking.

- Investigating deployment to real-world applications to identify challenges and improvements required for production systems. The authors note their system brings secure inference one step closer to practical applications.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving performance, expanding functionality, hardening privacy, and validating on more real-world systems. The core technical suggestion is optimizations for non-linear functions, with additional work needed to make large scale secure inference practical.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key question it is trying to address is:

How can we enable fast, accurate, and secure inference of large pretrained transformer models like LLama-7B using multiparty computation (MPC), without requiring model retraining or modifications?

The paper proposes a framework called Puma to tackle this challenge. Some of the key problems/limitations of prior work that Puma aims to address include:

- High inference cost due to expensive non-linear functions like GeLU and Softmax that are difficult to compute securely and efficiently. 

- Requirement of model retraining/fine-tuning to accommodate simpler approximations of non-linear functions, which can hurt model accuracy and be difficult for data-limited participants.

- Incompatibilities with plaintext model architectures due to modifications like replacing LayerNorm.

- Lack of open source frameworks that can support end-to-end secure inference on large pretrained models without modifications.

To summarize, the key focus and contribution of this paper is enabling fast, accurate, and secure inference on large transformer models like LLama-7B using efficient MPC techniques, without needing model retraining or architectural changes. Puma is proposed as an end-to-end framework to achieve this goal.
