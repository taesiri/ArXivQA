# [A Large Language Model-based Computational Approach to Improve   Identity-Related Write-Ups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Writing persuasive texts like essays that convey one's identity and experiences is challenging. It requires effectively framing central ideas, structuring the writing, using rhetorical devices like analogies/metaphors, providing supporting examples, ensuring clarity and flow.

Solution: 
- The paper proposes a computational approach to guide improvement of identity-related write-ups by using prompts to elicit constructive feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs). 

- It identifies 6 key activities: finding concepts, detailing concepts, evaluating LLM cues, selecting cues for exploration, combining LLM cues with write-up ideas, separate exploration of ideas.

- These activities are incorporated into an iterative exploration loop algorithm that generates/prioritizes LLM cues, combines them with the write-up, and continues prompting for refinements.

- Representations called Concept Graphs are used to visualize connections between concepts in the write-up and LLM responses to highlight opportunities for improvement.

Case Studies:
- Two examples are presented - an analogy-based write-up linking dancing and poetry, and a metaphor-based one using the Icarus story to convey the author's dance experiences.

- Concept graphs revealed areas for improvement like establishing clearer links between central ideas and supporting concepts/examples.

Contributions:  
- Novel computational approach for systematically eliciting LLM feedback to refine personal write-ups conveying identity/experiences

- Algorithm incorporating key activities for exploration, prioritization and combination of LLM cues with write-up concepts  

- Use of Concept Graphs to highlight improvement opportunities in clarity, flow, connectedness of ideas

- Demonstrated benefits on two real write-ups using analogies and metaphors to express personal identities
