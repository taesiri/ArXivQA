# [Deep Reinforcement Learning and Mean-Variance Strategies for Responsible   Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of responsible portfolio optimization, where investment objectives related to financial returns as well as environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are incorporated. Traditionally, mean-variance optimization (MVO) methods have been used that aim to maximize returns while minimizing risk. However, limitations of MVO have been identified and there is increased interest in integrating ESG objectives into portfolio allocation decisions. The paper aims to study deep reinforcement learning (RL) formulations for responsible portfolio optimization with ESG objectives and compare them to modified MVO approaches.

Methods:
The paper proposes additive and multiplicative utility functions to incorporate responsibility objectives with financial objectives for portfolio optimization. For MVO, convex additive formulations are provided building on prior work. For RL, both additive and multiplicative formulations are proposed to incorporate responsibility into the reward functions, with no convexity requirement. Proximal policy optimization algorithm is used for RL with modifications including differential Sharpe and Sortino ratios suitable for sequential decisions.

Experiments: 
The methods are evaluated on a universe of 29 Dow Jones stocks using price data from Yahoo Finance and ESG scores from Sustainalytics. Financial and responsibility performance of RL policies are compared to two MVO strategies over a 2-year volatile evaluation period. Multiple configurations with Sharpe or Sortino financial objectives combined additively or multiplicatively with ESG or component E/S/G responsibility objectives are assessed.  

Key Contributions:
1) Formulations for MVO to incorporate responsibility objectives in convex optimization problems suitable for quadratic programming solvers.
2) RL formulations using additive and multiplicative utility functions to incorporate responsibility without convexity constraints. 
3) Introduction of differential Sortino ratio for sequential portfolio optimization problems.
4) Comprehensive assessment of deep RL against MVO approaches using both financial and responsibility metrics over volatile markets.
5) Analysis showing competitive performance for RL compared to MVO in terms of returns and drawdowns, with less variability in performance across formulations.

The paper demonstrates that deep RL is a promising approach for responsible portfolio optimization that can handle non-convex objectives and provide robust performance against modified MVO methods.
