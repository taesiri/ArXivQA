# [BCLNet: Bilateral Consensus Learning for Two-View Correspondence Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Establishing reliable correspondences between two related images is critical for various computer vision tasks like stereo matching, SLAM, and structure from motion. However, initial correspondences obtained using feature matching often contain many outliers.
- Existing methods for correspondence pruning largely follow a local-to-global progressive learning strategy, focusing on the transition from local to global context while neglecting the interactions between contexts. This amplification of erroneous information negatively impacts performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a bilateral consensus learning strategy that acquires consensus in parallel between local and global contexts to better identify inliers.  
- A Bilateral Consensus Mining Attention (BCMA) block is designed to capture global consensus while embedding local context using nearest neighbor search on feature projections.  
- BCMA runs in parallel with an existing Order-Aware block that models local consensus. Their interaction produces bilateral consensus.
- A Bilateral Consensus Recalibrate block then rectifies the bilateral consensus using both global average pooling and local neighbor search to enhance robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to leverage bilateral consensus for correspondence pruning, through parallel modeling and interaction of local and global contexts.
- Novel BCMA block to effectively establish global consensus while retaining local context relevance.
- Bilateral Consensus Recalibrate block that recalibrates feature maps using global and local statistics.
- State-of-the-art performance demonstrated on benchmark datasets, with particularly significant gains on challenging outdoor scenarios. BCLNet also accelerates training versus prior arts.

In summary, the key novelty is the bilateral consensus learning strategy, enabled through specially designed modules, that robustly identifies inlier correspondences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Bilateral Consensus Learning Network (BCLNet) that interacts local and global context information in parallel to achieve bilateral consensus for robust two-view correspondence pruning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel consensus learning strategy for the two-view correspondence pruning task. In contrast to previous progressive learning strategies, it concurrently learns local and global consensuses in parallel and obtains bilateral consensus by establishing interdependencies between them. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time leveraging bilateral consensus to handle the task of two-view correspondence pruning.

2. It proposes a simple yet effective Bilateral Consensus Mining Attention (BCMA) block as the global consensus learning module in bilateral consensus and a Bilateral Consensus Recalibrate (BCR) block to rectify bilateral consensus. Through the process of learning and recalibration, the network is equipped to handle intricate matching scenarios. 

3. It develops an effective Bilateral Consensus Learning Network (BCLNet) for correspondence pruning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BCLNet on the correspondence classification task and the camera pose estimation task. Notably, BCLNet obtains significant gains over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a new bilateral consensus learning strategy and associated network architecture (BCLNet) for robust two-view correspondence pruning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:
