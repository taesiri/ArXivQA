# [UniAV: Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "UniAV: Unified Audio-Visual Perception for Multi-Task Video Localization":

Problem:
- Existing methods for video localization tasks like temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED), and audio-visual event localization (AVEL) focus only on one task, lacking shared knowledge and leading to redundant parameters. 
- Datasets across tasks have discrepancies in domain, duration, modalities, and characteristics. Unifying them is challenging.

Proposed Solution: UniAV
- Unifies TAL, SED, and AVEL within a single model through:
  1) Unified audio-visual encoding using a pre-trained model to obtain generic input representations
  2) Task-specific experts in transformer blocks to capture distinct features
  3) Unified language-aware classifier using prompts and text encoder for flexibility
- Enables model to leverage diverse data, share knowledge, and detect different types of instances

Main Contributions:
- First unified framework to solve TAL, SED, and AVEL using a single model
- Unified audio-visual encoding to address dataset discrepancies 
- Task-specific experts to learn unique knowledge per task
- Unified language-aware classifier for flexibility and potential open-vocabulary detection
- State-of-the-art or competitive results across tasks using fewer parameters 
- Shows multi-task learning is an effective pre-training technique for single-task models

In summary, the paper proposes UniAV, the first unified model capable of localizing visual actions, sound events and audio-visual events in untrimmed videos through a shared architecture. It unifies representations and classifiers while allowing task-specific learning, achieving strong performances across benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes UniAV, a unified framework that solves temporal action localization, sound event detection, and audio-visual event localization within a single model by leveraging task-specific experts and a language-aware classifier to share knowledge across tasks and modalities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing UniAV, the first unified framework that solves temporal action localization (TAL), sound event detection (SED), and audio-visual event localization (AVEL) within a single model, leading to a holistic understanding of video content.

2) Proposing a unified audio-visual encoding pipeline to address data discrepancies across diverse tasks, while incorporating task-specific experts to capture distinct features for each task. 

3) Designing a unified language-aware classifier, allowing the model to flexibly detect various types of instances and previously unseen ones during inference.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a unified model called UniAV that can jointly perform TAL, SED and AVEL in videos using a shared architecture. This is achieved through unified representation learning, task-specific experts, and a flexible classifier.
