# [GGRt: Towards Generalizable 3D Gaussians without Pose Priors in   Real-Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing neural rendering methods like NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) can synthesize novel views of a scene. However, they rely on accurate camera poses and struggle with high-resolution training/inference due to memory constraints. They also require lengthy per-scene optimization. Recent generalizable models still depend on poses and inherit drawbacks like slow rendering.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes GGRt, the first pose-free generalizable 3D-GS approach for real-time novel view synthesis, without needing camera poses or per-scene optimization. It contains:

1) Jointly trained IPO-Net and G-3DG model to robustly estimate relative poses and reconstruct scenes from images without prior poses.

2) Deferred Backpropagation (DBP) to enable high-resolution training and inference under memory constraints. 

3) Progressive Gaussian Cache to reuse cached gaussians between iterations, accelerating training and inference.

Main Contributions:

1) GGRt is the first pose-free generalizable 3D-GS method that achieves real-time performance for novel view synthesis.

2) The jointly optimized IPO-Net and G-3DG framework can effectively reconstruct scenes and estimate robust relative poses from unposed image observations.

3) The DBP mechanism overcomes GPU memory limitations, allowing high-resolution training and inference.

4) The Gaussian Cache significantly speeds up training and inference by progressive caching and reusing. 

5) Extensive experiments show GGRt surpasses existing pose-free methods in quality and speed. It also approaches pose-based 3D-GS methods despite not having pose priors.

In summary, GGRt advances the state-of-the-art in generalizable novel view synthesis through its pose-free capability, real-time efficiency and high visual quality. The proposed techniques to enable this leap open up new possibilities for practical applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GGRt, a novel pose-free generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting approach for real-time novel view synthesis, which jointly trains an iterative pose optimization network and a generalizable 3D Gaussian model to estimate robust relative poses and efficiently reconstruct scenes from unposed image observations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes GGRt, the first pose-free generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting approach for novel view synthesis. This eliminates the need for accurate camera poses during training and inference.

2. It introduces a joint learning framework with IPO-Net and G-3DG model that can robustly estimate relative camera poses and reconstruct scenes without requiring ground truth poses.

3. It develops a deferred backpropagation (DBP) mechanism that enables high-resolution training and inference, overcoming GPU memory limitations faced by prior works. 

4. It designs a Gaussian cache module with a store-query-release mechanism to reuse image features and poses from previous iterations. This progressively accelerates both training and inference.

5. Extensive experiments show that GGRt outperforms existing pose-free approaches in efficiency and effectiveness. It can also approach the performance of pose-based 3D-GS methods, while not relying on ground truth poses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first pose-free generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting approach (GGRt) for real-time novel view synthesis, along with innovations like joint learning, DBP, and Gaussian caching to make this possible.
