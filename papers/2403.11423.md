# [VmambaIR: Visual State Space Model for Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image restoration tasks like super-resolution, deblurring and deraining play a critical role in computer vision. However, existing methods have limitations - CNNs fail to capture long range dependencies, transformers have quadratic complexity, and diffusion models need large priors and are computationally expensive. There is a need for efficient and effective image restoration models.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes VmambaIR, a novel image restoration framework based on State Space Models (SSMs). Key aspects:

1) Adopts a UNet architecture using proposed Omni-Selective Scan (OSS) blocks to capture multi-scale features. 

2) The OSS block has an OSS module to model information flows efficiently in 6 directions, overcoming SSM limitations. Also uses an Efficient Feedforward Network (EFFN).

3) Proposes Omni Selective Scan to enable modeling image data comprehensively from 6 directions with minimal overhead, unlike previous SSM variants.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes VmambaIR, a first-of-its-kind image restoration model using SSMs and a tailored OSS architecture.

2) Designed components like OSS block, OSS module and Omni Selective Scan to effectively adapt SSM for multidimensional image data.

3) Demonstrates SOTA results on image super-resolution, real-world super-resolution and deraining using significantly fewer parameters and computations than state of the art.

4) Showcases potential of SSMs as an efficient alternative to CNNs and transformers for low-level vision, with innate ability to model high frequencies.

The paper makes significant contributions in introducing SSMs to image restoration, designing components to handle multidimensional image data, and outperforming prior arts on multiple tasks using fewer resources.
