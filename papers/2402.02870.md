# [Statistics without Interpretation: A Sober Look at Explainable Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points made in the paper:

Problem:
- The field of explainable ML lacks clarity on what constitutes an "explanation" and how explanation algorithms should be interpreted. Complex statistical methods are introduced without clear guidance on what questions they can actually answer about a model.

- This leads to invalid interpretations and usage of explanations. Even simple statistical methods like p-values are frequently misinterpreted, so complex explanation methods without clear interpretations are prone to misuse.

Proposed Perspective: 
- Clearly differentiate between the mathematical properties of an explanation algorithm (the "statistic") and the matter of interpretation (what questions it can answer).

- Explanation algorithms are statistics of functions, just as common statistics summarize properties of distributions. But most statistics don't have clear interpretations.

- Valid interpretations require showing what specific questions about a model can be answered, either directly from the definition or via rigorous empirical analysis.

Implications:
- Papers should state what interpretative questions an explanation method is designed to answer.

- Explanations without clear interpretations are themselves a black box that requires careful empirical analysis.

- Benchmarks can assess mathematical properties but not validate interpretations.

- It's better to measure properties like fairness directly rather than via proxy explanations. 

- Many explanations may only be useful to experts. Clear communication of limitations is important.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptual framework to separate statistic and interpretation of explanations

- Drawing parallels to challenges of interpretation in statistics

- Argues for more rigor and transparency on what explanations can and cannot explain

- Outlines implications for research on evaluation/benchmarks and communication of limitations


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key point made in the paper:

The paper argues that explanation algorithms in machine learning are often mathematically complex statistics that lack clear interpretations about what real-world questions they can answer, which leads to invalid usages and claims.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is to differentiate between the mathematical properties of explanation algorithms (which the authors refer to as "statistics" of functions) and the matter of interpretation. Specifically:

1) The paper argues that explanation algorithms are complex statistics of functions, and most such statistics do not have clear interpretations in terms of answering questions about the function's behavior or properties. 

2) The paper draws an analogy between explanation algorithms and statistics, arguing that we should be careful about interpreting complex statistics whose interpretations are unclear, just as has happened historically with statistics in applied domains.

3) The paper concludes that future work on explanation algorithms should clearly state what questions an explanation algorithm can answer, rather than making broad claims about "interpretability." Explanation algorithms without clear interpretations should be treated as black boxes and studied empirically.

In summary, the key insight is to differentiate the mathematical properties of explanations from their interpretations, advocate for clarity on what questions explanations can answer, and be cautious about interpreting complex explanation statistics whose meaning is unclear. This provides a framework for critically evaluating explanation methods and setting expectations on what they can deliver.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts discussed are:

- Statistic - A functional that maps a complex object (like a probability distribution, function, or learning algorithm) to a simpler space, used as a common framework to describe explanations, traditional statistics, etc.

- Interpretation - The matter of whether a statistic allows one to answer real-world questions about a model, its behavior, relationships to the world, etc. 

- Explanation - A statistic of a function claimed to be useful for interpretation, which needs to be demonstrated.

- Errors in interpretation - Issues that arise when statistics lack clear interpretations, leading to invalid usages. Parallel drawn to misinterpretation of p-values.

- Black box explanation - An explanation algorithm without a clear interpretation that must be studied via experiments rather than reasoning about its definition.

- Benchmark datasets - Useful for studying mathematical properties of explanations, but not their interpretation.

- Implicit study of properties - Explaining a model does not reveal information about robustness, fairness, etc. These should be directly measured.  

- Expert interpretations - Many explanations may only be useful to those with specialized knowledge, not lay people.

The key distinction the paper makes is between the mathematical/statistical properties of explanations versus their practical interpretation and usage. The terminology around explanations, robustness, and interpretation highlights some of the core issues discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper argues that many explanation algorithms lack a clear interpretation. What concrete steps could researchers take to establish clearer interpretations for existing explanation algorithms? 

2) The authors propose that future papers should explicitly state the interpretive questions that proposed explanation algorithms are designed to answer. What challenges might arise in clearly specifying these questions upfront during the research process?

3) The paper draws an analogy between explainable ML and applied statistics. In what ways could insights from the philosophy of science around statistical interpretation be applied to establish stronger practices around the interpretation of explanations?

4) The authors argue explanations without clear interpretations should be treated as black boxes and studied via rigorous experiments. What types of experiments might be well-suited to elucidate the usefulness and limitations of existing explanation methods? 

5) The paper states that benchmark datasets will have limited utility for validating interpretability claims around explanations. What role then can benchmarks play in advancing research on explanations?

6) The authors claim studying robustness and fairness implicitly via explanations is not sensible. When might studying the relationship between explanations and other properties like fairness still be worthwhile?

7) What unique challenges exist in establishing clear interpretations for explanations generated from complex models like large language models?

8) The paper argues explanations might only be interpretable by experts. How might the notions of selective explanatoriness and functional explanatoriness help broaden the accessibility of explanations?

9) The authors provide a unified mathematical framework for thinking about explanations. What extensions to the framework could better capture interactive or multi-modal explanations?

10) The paper focuses exclusively on post-hoc explanations. How might inherent interpretability properties of self-explaining models lead to clearer interpretations compared to post-hoc methods?
