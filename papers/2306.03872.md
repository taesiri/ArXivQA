# [Deductive Verification of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we enable large language models to perform explicit, rigorous, and trustworthy deductive reasoning through self-verification?The key points related to this research question are:- The authors aim to have language models perform deductive reasoning that is explicit, rigorous, and coherent, similar to the logical reasoning emphasized in ancient Greek logic. - They want to ensure the validity and trustworthiness of the reasoning process through self-verification by the language models.- Directly verifying the validity of an entire complex deductive reasoning chain is challenging, even for advanced models. - The authors propose decomposing the verification into step-by-step subprocesses, each only receiving necessary context/premises.- They introduce "Natural Program", a natural language-based deductive reasoning format to facilitate this decomposition and step-wise verification.- By integrating verification into each deductive reasoning stage, they significantly enhance the rigor and trustworthiness of the generated reasoning steps and answers.In summary, the central research question focuses on how to achieve explicit, rigorous and trustworthy deductive reasoning from language models through a self-verification process based on the proposed Natural Program reasoning format.
