# [Superposition with Delayed Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Superposition with Delayed Unification":

Problem:
In saturation-based proof systems like superposition, unification has traditionally been treated as an atomic step that happens before inferences. However, for logics like higher-order logic where unification can return infinite sets of unifiers, it is useful to interleave unification with inferences. This paper investigates moving unification to the calculus level for first-order superposition as a step towards applying the idea to more complex logics.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a modified superposition calculus where unification is delayed. Instead of eagerly computing most general unifiers, the calculus carries out a single unification step and adds any remaining non-trivial unification constraints as negative literals. Additional inference rules then operate on these negative literals to incrementally solve the unification problem. This shifts unification from a preprocessing step to interleaved constraints resolved during proof search.

For example, consider clauses:

C1: f(x, g(x)) ≠ t 
C2: f(g(b),y) = t

Instead of unifying f(g(b),y) and f(x, g(x)) to derive a contradiction, the new calculus would add literal x ≠ g(b) ∨ g(x) ≠ y as a constraint. Further inferences would then solve this constraint to reach a refutation.

Contributions:

- Formalization of a superposition calculus with delayed unification for first-order logic
- Proof that the calculus remains refutationally complete
- Discussion of benefits - avoiding complex indices, applicability to complex logics
- Experimental evaluation showing some promise when eagerly solving simple constraints

The work provides a blueprint for handling unification in complex logics by incrementally solving constraints. It also shows that even for first-order logic, delayed unification can have some practical benefits. The ideas may generalize into a unification framework for ensuring completeness.
