# [Unified learning-based lossy and lossless JPEG recompression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02705)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified lossy and lossless JPEG image recompression framework to address the gap between current lossless and lossy JPEG recompression methods. The framework consists of a learned quantization table, learned inverse quantization table, and a Markovian hierarchical variational autoencoder model for lossless compression of the quantized DCT coefficients. During compression, the JPEG image is decoded to DCT coefficients, quantized by the learned quantization table, then losslessly compressed by the autoencoder model. For decompression, the process is reversed. The framework is optimized by iteratively updating the autoencoder model to reduce rate and updating the quantization/inverse quantization tables to optimize rate-distortion. Experiments show the proposed method can achieve arbitrarily low distortion down to lossless compression without exceeding the lossless compression rate upper bound. This bridges the gap between lossy and lossless JPEG recompression and outperforms previous learned and hand-crafted methods for JPEG recompression in the high rate region near lossless. A limitation is the rate-distortion curve falls quickly at lower rates. Key innovations are the unified framework and use of learned quantization tables to optimize for downstream lossless compression.
