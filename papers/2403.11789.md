# [EMIE-MAP: Large-Scale Road Surface Reconstruction Based on Explicit Mesh   and Implicit Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11789)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate large-scale road surface reconstruction is important for autonomous driving systems to enable lane perception and high-precision mapping. However, existing methods have limitations:

- Traditional multi-view stereo methods produce incomplete or noisy results for untextured roads. 

- Neural radiance fields (NeRF) methods have high compute requirements for large scenes.

- Prior road reconstruction methods are limited to small areas or flat roads.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel method called EMIE-MAP for accurate, large-scale reconstruction of road surfaces including color, semantics and elevation.

Method - EMIE-MAP:

- Represents the road geometry using an explicit triangular mesh, where each vertex stores:
  - Implicit encoding for color and semantics 
  - Initial coordinates (x,y,z0)

- Handles elevation optimization using:
  - Trajectory-based initialization of z0
  - Elevation residual prediction with MLP

- Employs multiple RGB MLPs to decode the implicit color encoding, enabling modeling of different camera characteristics

- Renders RGB and semantics via projection for optimization against input surround-view images 

- Uses LiDAR points to supervise elevation learning

Contributions:

- Novel road surface representation combining explicit mesh and implicit encoding

- Trajectory initialization and residual learning for robust elevation optimization

- Multi-camera color MLP decoding, allowing surround recon with different cameras

- Remarkable recon performance in diverse real-world challenging scenarios:
  - Varying luminance, poor lighting, steep slopes
  - Captures color, semantics, accurate elevation
  - Compatible with multiple camera models

The method effectively integrates geometry, appearance and semantics for accurate large-scale road recon, overcoming limitations of prior reconstruction techniques. Experiments validate the approach produces high quality reconstructions even for difficult real-world road data.
