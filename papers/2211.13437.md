# [Seeing What You Miss: Vision-Language Pre-training with Semantic   Completion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13437)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:

How can we improve vision-language pre-training models to better learn global semantic representations and cross-modal alignment? 

The key hypothesis is that existing masked modeling pre-training objectives like masked language modeling (MLM) and masked vision modeling (MVM) focus only on reconstructing local masked tokens. This may lead to inadequate learning of global semantic features that capture higher-level cross-modal information. 

To address this, the authors propose a new pre-training task called Semantic Completion Learning (SCL). The key idea is to recover the global semantics of masked data by exploiting cross-modal interactions. This allows the model to generate more representative global features with improved global-to-local alignment.

In summary, the central research question is how to improve global semantic learning and cross-modal alignment in vision-language pre-training. The key hypothesis is that reconstructing local masked tokens is insufficient and recovering global semantics of masked data through cross-modal interactions can improve global feature learning. SCL is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a new pre-training task called Semantic Completion Learning (SCL) that recovers missing semantic information from unmasked data to promote learning of more representative global features. This is different from prior masked modeling tasks that focus on reconstructing local masked tokens. 

2. Designing an adaptive vision encoder that can readily transfer multimodal pre-training knowledge between images and videos.

3. Conducting comprehensive experiments on multiple vision-language downstream tasks including VQA, visual reasoning, image-text retrieval, and video-text retrieval. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCL task and flexible vision encoder, with the model achieving state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.

In summary, the key innovations seem to be the new SCL pre-training objective and flexible vision encoder architecture that enables strong performance on both image and video multimodal tasks. The extensive experimental validation on diverse downstream benchmarks also demonstrates the generalization ability of the approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in one sentence: 

The paper proposes a new vision-language pre-training task called Semantic Completion Learning (SCL) which recovers missing semantic information from unmasked data to learn more representative global features and improve cross-modal alignment, and introduces a flexible vision encoder enabling the model to perform on both image-text and video-text tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses on vision-language pre-training, which is an active area of research lately. Recent papers like LXMERT, ViLBERT, UNITER, Oscar, etc have explored different architectures and pre-training objectives for learning joint representations of images and text. 

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new pre-training task called Semantic Completion Learning (SCL). This is different from prior works that mainly focused on masked language modeling and masked image modeling. SCL aims to recover the global semantics of masked data using cross-modal information.

- Most prior works have used standard datasets like COCO, Visual Genome etc for pre-training. This paper additionally uses video data (WebVid dataset) for pre-training the model, so it can handle both images and videos. The flexible vision encoder design allows transferring knowledge between image and video domains.

- For evaluation, this paper tests the model on a comprehensive set of downstream tasks - VQA, visual reasoning, image/video-text retrieval. Many recent papers focus only on certain tasks like retrieval. Testing on multiple tasks shows the generalization ability of the proposed approach.

- The results are state-of-the-art compared to prior works that use similar model size and pre-training data scale. The gains over previous methods like METER, VLMo, TCL validate the benefits of the proposed SCL task for learning better joint representations.

In summary, this paper advances vision-language pre-training research by proposing a new pre-training task, using both image and video data, and demonstrating strong performance on a variety of downstream tasks. The flexible encoder design and the idea of semantic completion seem promising for this field.
