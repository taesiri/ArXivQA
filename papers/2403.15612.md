# [InterFusion: Text-Driven Generation of 3D Human-Object Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15612)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "InterFusion: Text-Driven Generation of 3D Human-Object Interaction":

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenging task of generating realistic 3D scenes depicting human-object interactions from textual descriptions in a zero-shot, text-to-3D manner. Two key issues are identified: (1) Direct application of existing text-to-3D methods performs poorly on this task, largely due to lack of paired text-interaction training data. (2) Inherent difficulties in generating multiple interacting concepts simultaneously.

Method: 
The paper proposes InterFusion, a two-stage framework for text-driven HOI generation:

Stage 1 - Anchor Pose Generation: Leverages recent advances in text-to-image generation to create a large-scale dataset of HOI images paired with estimated 3D poses. A mapping is learned between textual interaction descriptions and plausible 3D poses using CLIP embeddings and clustering. This allows retrieving an "anchor pose" for a given textual description.

Stage 2 - Anchor Pose Guided HOI Generation: Employs neural radiance fields to generate separate human (H-NeRF) and object (O-NeRF) models. The anchor pose provides spatial constraints - occupied space for human model, unoccupied space for object. Textual descriptions guide optimization via score-based diffusion models. A local-global process separately optimizes human/object models, and then jointly refines the entire scene for coherence.

Main Contributions:
(1) A novel two-stage framework, InterFusion, incorporating pose estimation to simplify text-to-3D conversion and provide constraints for HOI generation.

(2) Leveraging text-to-3D methods with a local-global optimization strategy to ensure accurate and seamless integration of human and object models.

(3) Demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art in 3D HOI generation, affirming InterFusion's ability to create detailed and contextually coherent interaction scenes from text.
