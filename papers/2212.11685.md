# Text Generation with Diffusion Language Models: A Pre-training Approach   with Continuous Paragraph Denoise

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is developing a large-scale pretrained diffusion language model for text generation, called GENIE. The central hypothesis is that pretrained diffusion models can achieve strong performance on diverse text generation tasks like summarization and commonsense reasoning. Specifically, the paper proposes two main contributions:1. Introducing GENIE, the first large-scale pretrained diffusion language model for text generation. GENIE consists of an encoder-decoder framework with a bidirectional encoder and a diffusion model decoder.2. Proposing a novel pretraining task called "continuous paragraph denoise" (CPD) to train GENIE on a large text corpus. The CPD task trains the model to denoise and reconstruct continuous paragraphs. The central research question is whether the proposed pretrained GENIE model with the CPD pretraining objective can generate high-quality and diverse texts across different downstream NLG tasks. The paper conducts experiments on summarization and commonsense generation benchmarks to demonstrate GENIE's effectiveness compared to previous Transformer and diffusion models.In summary, the key hypothesis is that pretrained diffusion models like GENIE can achieve strong text generation capabilities by leveraging large-scale pretraining and the proposed CPD training approach. The paper aims to demonstrate the viability of this direction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a large-scale language pre-training model called GENIE for text generation using the diffusion model framework. 2. It introduces a novel pre-training task called "continuous paragraph denoise" (CPD) to train the diffusion language model on a large corpus. The CPD task trains the model to denoise and reconstruct coherent paragraphs.3. It evaluates GENIE on downstream NLG tasks including summarization and commonsense reasoning. Results show GENIE achieves strong performance comparable to Transformer-based autoregressive models.4. It analyzes GENIE's generation diversity compared to autoregressive models. Experiments and case studies demonstrate GENIE can generate more diverse outputs.5. It validates the benefits of pre-training GENIE at scale and provides ablation studies on the impact of various training hyperparameters.In summary, the main contribution is proposing GENIE, a pre-trained diffusion language model for text generation, along with a tailored pre-training objective CPD. The paper shows this framework can generate high-quality and diverse texts on NLG tasks.
