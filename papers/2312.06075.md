# [Oracle Character Recognition using Unsupervised Discriminative   Consistency Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06075)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method called unsupervised discriminative consistency network (UDCN) for oracle character recognition (OrCR). It transfers knowledge from labeled handprinted oracle characters (source domain) to unlabeled scanned oracle characters (target domain). Scanned oracle characters suffer from serious abrasion, stain, and distortion. Existing UDA methods fail to achieve robust and discriminative target features. UDCN performs weak and strong augmentations on target images and generates pseudo-labels for consistency training to improve model robustness. It also optimizes an unsupervised transition loss based on between-class and within-class transition probabilities to encourage inter-class discrimination and intra-class compactness in the target features. Extensive experiments on Oracle-241 and digit datasets demonstrate that UDCN learns robust and discriminative features for scanned oracle characters. It substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering 15.1% absolute improvement over the previous best method on Oracle-241 dataset and achieving new state-of-the-art performance. The simplicity and effectiveness of UDCN will help unlock the cooperative potential between AI and historians by improving the accuracy of automatic OrCR systems.
