# [CodaMal: Contrastive Domain Adaptation for Malaria Detection in Low-Cost   Microscopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10478)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Malaria diagnosis requires scalable solutions that can work with low-cost microscopes (LCMs). However, LCM images are of lower quality compared to high-cost microscope (HCM) images.  
- Existing deep learning methods for malaria detection require extensive annotated data which is burdensome for LCM images.
- A practical solution should train on easily annotated HCM images but work reliably on prevalent LCM images during testing.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CodaMal, an end-to-end framework for contrastive domain adaptation to minimize the domain shift between HCM (training) and LCM (testing).
- It consists of two main objectives:
   1) Object detection losses using YOLOv5 to ensure accurate parasite detection.
   2) Novel domain adaptive contrastive (DAC) loss to encourage representational similarity between HCM and LCM images.
- For DAC loss, HCM and LCM images are passed through a shared backbone and non-linear projection head. Representations of corresponding HCM-LCM pairs are pulled closer while non-corresponding ones are pushed apart.

Main Contributions:
- First work to investigate contrastive domain adaptation for malaria detection between HCM and LCM images.
- Proposed end-to-end method outperforms prior state-of-the-art by 16% mAP on M5 dataset, the largest publicly available dataset.
- Achieves 21x speedup during inference and requires only half the trainable parameters compared to prior work.
- DAC loss is shown to be a key contributor, improving performance by 7.8-20.2% over baseline.
- Qualitative results demonstrate accurate detection across varying magnifications.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in adapting HCM-trained malaria detectors to work effectively on LCM test images in an end-to-end manner using contrastive domain adaptation. The gains in accuracy, inference-time and model complexity highlight its practical merits.
