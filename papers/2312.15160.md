# [Human-AI Collaboration in Real-World Complex Environment with   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15160)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Protecting critical infrastructure like airports against security threats is complex, risky and expensive. Fully automated solutions are not yet mature enough for such critical applications. On the other hand, continuous surveillance and quick response to threats would benefit from AI capabilities. Humans possess domain expertise and contextual understanding that is difficult for AI agents to replicate. Thus, there is a need to effectively leverage human knowledge in collaborative human-AI systems for such applications.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop a novel simulator for an airport protection scenario involving AI-powered drones and human teams collaborating to defend against enemy drone attacks. They formulate this as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. The ally (defender) drones are controlled by RL agents trained using deep Q-learning algorithms. A user interface allows humans to assist the RL agents by providing demonstrations or correcting their policies online.  

Key Contributions:
1) A new multi-agent simulator modeling the dynamics of a real-world airport protection scenario with ally and enemy drones.

2) Implementation of deep MARL algorithms to train defender drone agents.

3) A user interface enabling effective human-AI collaboration through human demonstrations and policy corrections.

4) Empirical demonstration that human demonstrations make RL agents learn faster, and human-AI collaboration outperforms humans or AI agents alone.

5) Experiments showing policy correction by humans requires lower workload than fully controlling drones, while yielding better performance.

In summary, the work introduces a simulated collaborative human-AI system leveraging the complementary strengths of humans and AI agents. It highlights the benefits of human-in-the-loop guidance for complex MARL problems. The airport security scenario and interface could enable further research into effective human-AI teaming.
