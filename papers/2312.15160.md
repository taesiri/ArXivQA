# [Human-AI Collaboration in Real-World Complex Environment with   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15160)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Protecting critical infrastructure like airports against security threats is complex, risky and expensive. Fully automated solutions are not yet mature enough for such critical applications. On the other hand, continuous surveillance and quick response to threats would benefit from AI capabilities. Humans possess domain expertise and contextual understanding that is difficult for AI agents to replicate. Thus, there is a need to effectively leverage human knowledge in collaborative human-AI systems for such applications.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors develop a novel simulator for an airport protection scenario involving AI-powered drones and human teams collaborating to defend against enemy drone attacks. They formulate this as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problem. The ally (defender) drones are controlled by RL agents trained using deep Q-learning algorithms. A user interface allows humans to assist the RL agents by providing demonstrations or correcting their policies online.  

Key Contributions:
1) A new multi-agent simulator modeling the dynamics of a real-world airport protection scenario with ally and enemy drones.

2) Implementation of deep MARL algorithms to train defender drone agents.

3) A user interface enabling effective human-AI collaboration through human demonstrations and policy corrections.

4) Empirical demonstration that human demonstrations make RL agents learn faster, and human-AI collaboration outperforms humans or AI agents alone.

5) Experiments showing policy correction by humans requires lower workload than fully controlling drones, while yielding better performance.

In summary, the work introduces a simulated collaborative human-AI system leveraging the complementary strengths of humans and AI agents. It highlights the benefits of human-in-the-loop guidance for complex MARL problems. The airport security scenario and interface could enable further research into effective human-AI teaming.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a simulated environment for airport defense where human operators and AI agents collaborate, showing that combining human expertise with learning from demonstration and policy correction allows the agents to efficiently learn policies that outperform either humans or agents alone.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introduces a novel multi-agent simulator for an airport defense-specific use case modeling real-world dynamics with multiple ally and enemy drone agents.

2. Uses state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to train multiple agents inside the novel simulator.

3. Develops a user interface inside the simulator, which enables human operators to dynamically take control of single or multiple agents to produce in-context demonstrations, thus enabling human-agent collaboration. 

4. Demonstrates empirically that trained agent demonstrations or a mixture of human and agent demonstrations help the agent learn faster.

5. Compares and evaluates multiple advice-giving techniques, i.e., learning from demonstration and policy correction.

6. Compares the human cognitive workload for various advice-giving techniques using a user study demonstrating that policy correction requires less effort than humans having full control over the agents.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a simulation platform and user interface for human-AI collaboration, along with empirical demonstrations showing that incorporating human input through demonstrations and policy corrections improves agent learning efficiency and overall task performance.
