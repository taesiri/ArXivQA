# [GOEnFusion: Gradient Origin Encodings for 3D Forward Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08744)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel encoding mechanism called Gradient Origin Encoding (GOEn) that can effectively encode source view images of 3D scenes into various 3D scene representations such as radiance fields. The key idea is to compute the gradient of the reconstruction loss between rendered images of the 3D representation and source images with respect to an origin scene representation. This encoded 3D scene representation tries to maximize the transfer of information from the source views. The authors then propose GOEnFusion which combines GOEn with 3D forward diffusion models to enable training on only 2D images. This addresses limitations of prior forward diffusion techniques requiring expensive autoregressive fusion during sampling. Experiments on the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate GOEn's ability to transfer information into various 3D formats in a partial autoencoder setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons also show GOEnFusion generates higher quality 3D samples compared to recent diffusion and GAN baselines. Additional experiments demonstrate promising deterministic 3D reconstruction from only images using GOEn. In summary, the proposed GOEn mechanism enables encoding images into 3D formats for improved conditional 3D generation and reconstruction.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating high-quality 3D content is important for applications like movies, video games, VR/AR, etc. However, there are three main challenges: lack of large-scale 3D datasets, no standard 3D representation, and difficulty in transferring 2D generative modeling methods to 3D. The recently proposed 3D forward diffusion models allow training with only 2D supervision, but have limitations like being view-conditioned rather than unconditional, restricting the 3D representation to point clouds, and requiring slow autoregressive sampling.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes GOEn (Gradient Origin Encodings) that can encode 2D views into any 3D representation without a pretrained feature extractor. GOEn encodings try to maximize the transfer of information from the views. The proposed GOEnFusion pairs GOEn with a 3D forward diffusion model to overcome the limitations of prior work. It allows unconditional sampling, generalizes to any 3D representation, and enables direct 3D sampling without autoregression.

Contributions:
1) Propose GOEn as a unifying encoding to transfer 2D view information into different 3D representations.
2) Present GOEnFusion as an improved 3D forward diffusion model using GOEn to allow arbitrary 3D representations, unconditional sampling, and avoid slow autoregressive sampling.
3) Evaluate GOEn's information transfer ability in a partial autoencoder setting.
4) Demonstrate GOEnFusion can robustly do 3D generation and reconstruction on the OmniObject3D dataset, outperforming prior state-of-the-art.

The key insight is to encode 2D views into 3D not through a pretrained feature extractor like PixelNerf, but directly through the gradient of the rendering loss. This provides a simple unified recipe for arbitrary 3D representations. Combining this with 3D diffusion enables an improved conditional generative model for 3D.
