# [GOEnFusion: Gradient Origin Encodings for 3D Forward Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08744)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel encoding mechanism called Gradient Origin Encoding (GOEn) that can effectively encode source view images of 3D scenes into various 3D scene representations such as radiance fields. The key idea is to compute the gradient of the reconstruction loss between rendered images of the 3D representation and source images with respect to an origin scene representation. This encoded 3D scene representation tries to maximize the transfer of information from the source views. The authors then propose GOEnFusion which combines GOEn with 3D forward diffusion models to enable training on only 2D images. This addresses limitations of prior forward diffusion techniques requiring expensive autoregressive fusion during sampling. Experiments on the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate GOEn's ability to transfer information into various 3D formats in a partial autoencoder setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons also show GOEnFusion generates higher quality 3D samples compared to recent diffusion and GAN baselines. Additional experiments demonstrate promising deterministic 3D reconstruction from only images using GOEn. In summary, the proposed GOEn mechanism enables encoding images into 3D formats for improved conditional 3D generation and reconstruction.
