# [Perception Test: A Diagnostic Benchmark for Multimodal Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13786)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the main goal of this paper is to propose a new multimodal video benchmark called the "Perception Test" to evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models across different modalities (video, audio, text). The key aspects that set this benchmark apart are:- It focuses on evaluating skills and reasoning abilities rather than just performance on computational tasks like classification or detection. The skills tested include memory, abstraction, physics, semantics. - The reasoning abilities tested include descriptive, explanatory, predictive and counterfactual reasoning.- It uses purposefully designed real-world videos rather than just publicly available videos to systematically probe the skills and reasoning. - The videos are densely annotated with multiple types of labels (object tracks, point tracks, action/sound segments, multiple choice QA, grounded QA) to enable thorough evaluation.- The emphasis is on assessing transfer capabilities in a zero-shot or limited fine-tuning setting rather than in-domain performance.So in summary, the key hypothesis seems to be that this new benchmark can more robustly and efficiently assess the general perception abilities of multimodal models compared to prior datasets focused on individual tasks. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the careful construction and annotation of the dataset, definition of suitable tasks, and evaluation of multiple strong baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contribution seems to be proposing a new multimodal video benchmark called the Perception Test (PT) to evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models. The key aspects of PT highlighted are:- It focuses on skills (memory, abstraction, physics, semantics) and types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual) rather than just computational tasks like classification or detection. This allows more comprehensive evaluation.- It contains real-world videos purposefully designed and filmed to show interesting perceptual situations across video, audio and text modalities. - It has dense annotations of multiple types - object tracks, point tracks, action/sound segments, multiple choice QA, grounded QA. This enables both language and non-language evaluation.- It aims to evaluate the transfer capabilities of models, in a zero-shot/few-shot setting or with limited finetuning, rather than just in-dataset performance.- The training set is small to avoid overfitting, with separate validation and held-out test splits to benchmark transfer.So in summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing this new multimodal video benchmark PT that aims to provide a more comprehensive and efficient way to evaluate perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on the paper content, here is a one sentence summary: The paper proposes a new multimodal video benchmark called the Perception Test to evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models across different modalities and types of reasoning, using purposefully designed real-world videos with dense annotations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on multimodal video benchmarks:- Focus on skills and reasoning: This paper introduces a new perspective compared to most prior video benchmarks, which have focused on computational tasks like classification, detection, or tracking. The Perception Test benchmark proposes evaluating models on their abilities related to memory, abstraction, physics, and semantics, across different types of reasoning. This is a unique approach that aims to more directly assess the capabilities of perception models.- Real-world videos: Many existing video datasets rely on web videos or synthetic data. The Perception Test uses purposefully filmed real-world videos to better control the diversity and complexity of the visual situations. This could allow for more systematic probing of models. The video collection process seems quite extensive.- Dense multimodal annotations: The dataset contains multiple annotation types, including tracks, segments, and question-answers. This allows evaluating both low-level and high-level perception abilities on the same videos. Many datasets focus on a single task. The density of annotations is also higher than typical benchmarks.- Limited training data: A key characteristic is that only a small portion of the data is provided for training/fine-tuning. This is meant to benchmark the transfer capabilities of pretrained models. Many datasets focus on training performance.- Human performance: The inclusion of human baselines provides an important point of comparison to assess current models. The large gap shows there is significant room for improvement.Overall, the Perception Test takes a novel approach compared to prior video benchmarks, with a focus on diagnostic evaluation of transfer abilities across a range of perception skills and reasoning types. The video collection process and dense multimodal annotations also differentiate it from related datasets. If validated through community adoption, it could become a standard for benchmarking video perception models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing a single model architecture that can perform all the tasks in the benchmark, rather than separate per-task models. They suggest this is an important direction for advancing general perception and reasoning capabilities.- Improving performance on counterfactual reasoning questions, where current models struggle. Developing better capabilities for this type of reasoning is important for real-world operation.- Reducing the gap between model performance and human performance on the benchmark across all skill areas, especially memory-related skills where the gap is largest. - Adding new types of videos, tasks, and modalities to the benchmark over time to expand its coverage, such as tool use videos or new languages for the question-answering tasks.- Using the benchmark to enable cross-pollination between communities working on low-level tasks like tracking and flow estimation and communities working on high-level scene understanding. The combination of annotations in the benchmark facilitates this.- Collaborating with the larger research community to grow and improve the benchmark over time.In summary, the key directions are developing more general and capable multimodal perception models, improving performance on critical reasoning skills like counterfactuals, closing the gap with human performance, expanding the coverage of the benchmark, enabling synergy across research communities, and collaborating to improve the benchmark over time.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key points are:- The paper is proposing a new multimodal video benchmark called the Perception Test (PT) to evaluate the perception and reasoning skills of pre-trained multimodal models like Flamingo, BEiT-3, or GPT-4. - Existing benchmarks focus on specific computational tasks like classification or detection. In contrast, PT aims to assess models more comprehensively across different skills (memory, abstraction, physics, semantics) and types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual).- PT contains 11.6k real-world videos densely annotated with 6 types of labels - object tracks, point tracks, action/sound segments, multiple choice QA, grounded QA. This enables both language and non-language evaluation on a common set of videos.- The goal is to probe models for their transfer capabilities in a low-data regime, rather than their in-dataset performance. So PT has a small training set for fine-tuning/prompting and the rest is used for evaluation.- Baselines and a challenge server are provided. Results show a gap between state-of-the-art models (43.6% accuracy) and human performance (91.4% accuracy) on the multiple choice QA, indicating room for improvement.In summary, PT is proposing a new comprehensive video benchmark to evaluate multimodal perception models, with a focus on assessing transferable skills beyond task performance. The key novelty is the coverage of multiple skills and reasoning types using purpose-designed real-world videos.
