# [Neural Video Compression with Feature Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Neural Video Compression with Feature Modulation":

Problem:
The paper identifies two major issues limiting the practicality of neural video codecs (NVCs):
1) Lack of wide quality range support - Previous NVCs can only support a very limited quality range (avg 3.8dB PSNR) in a single model, insufficient for real-world use.  
2) Performance degradation under long prediction chains - When using only a single intra frame (intra-period=-1), previous state-of-the-art NVC suffers from serious quality degradation due to error propagation.

Proposed Solution: 
To address issue 1, the paper proposes modulating the latent features via a learnable quantization scaler. A uniform quantization parameter sampling method is used during training to enhance learning of the scaler. This allows smooth quality adjustment across a much wider 11.4dB PSNR range in a single model. Rate control capabilities are also demonstrated based on the new model.
For issue 2, longer videos are used for training and a periodic feature refreshing mechanism is introduced. This alleviates error accumulation over long prediction chains.

Main Contributions:
1) A new NVC (DCVC-FM) that supports wide quality range (11.4dB vs 3.8dB) adjustment in a single model via feature modulation techniques.
2) Demonstration of basic rate control capabilities based on the new model.
3) A periodic feature refreshing method that enables the model to cope with long prediction chains of only a single intra frame.
4) Overall, DCVC-FM advances state-of-the-art in NVC: 29.7% lower bitrate than previous best model, with 16% lower complexity. It significantly outperforms modern video codecs H.265 and H.266.

In summary, via feature modulation, the paper delivers an NVC with much enhanced practical capabilities - wide quality range, basic rate control, long GOP support. This represents an important milestone in progressing NVC technology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes feature modulation techniques to enable wide quality range support and cope with long prediction chains in a neural video codec, achieving state-of-the-art compression efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to neural video compression:

1) It proposes feature modulation techniques to enable a neural video codec (DCVC-FM) to support a wide quality range (about 11.4dB PSNR) in a single model. This is achieved by modulating the latent features via a learnable quantization scaler.

2) It addresses issues with long prediction chains and temporal error accumulation by modulating/refreshing the propagated temporal features periodically. This allows DCVC-FM to maintain performance even with a large GOP size and single intra frame setting. 

3) It improves the codec's versatility by enabling support for both RGB and YUV colorspaces within the same model, without any fine-tuning. It also demonstrates low-precision 16-bit inference with negligible impact on compression performance.

4) Experiments show that under the single intra frame setting, DCVC-FM achieves 29.7% bitrate savings over the previous state-of-the-art DCVC-DC codec, with 16% lower multiply-accumulate operations. It also significantly outperforms traditional video codecs like H.265/VTM and the latest H.266 ECM codec prototype.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed feature modulation techniques to address critical issues like quality range, long prediction chains, versatility etc. to advance the state-of-the-art in neural video compression. DCVC-FM represents an important practical milestone.
