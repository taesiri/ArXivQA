# [f-FERM: A Scalable Framework for Robust Fair Empirical Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03259)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a unified stochastic optimization framework ($f$-FERM) for fair empirical risk minimization using $f$-divergence measures as regularizers. $f$-divergences generalize existing fairness notions like mutual information and allow capturing nonlinear correlations between sensitive attributes and predictions. The authors derive a provably convergent stochastic optimization algorithm for $f$-FERM using variational Fenchel duality that can work for small batch sizes. They also extend $f$-FERM to handle distribution shifts between training and test data using distributionally robust optimization, where the uncertainty set is defined using $f$-divergences or $\ell_p$ norms. Two algorithms with convergence guarantees are proposed - one for small distribution shifts using Taylor approximation, and another for potentially large shifts under $\ell_\infty$ norm by relaxing probability simplex constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate $f$-FERM's superior fairness-accuracy tradeoffs over state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, under varying batch sizes and degrees of distribution shift. Both $f$-FERM formulations enjoy theoretical convergence guarantees for finding stationary solutions. The unified $f$-FERM framework allows stochastic training of complex deep learning models while providing formal fairness certificates.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f-divergence measures that enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees and outperforms existing methods across a range of batch sizes and under distribution shift.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents a unified stochastic optimization framework called $f$-FERM for fair empirical risk minimization based on $f$-divergence measures. This framework allows developing theoretically convergent first-order stochastic algorithms even when only small batches of data are available at each iteration.

2) It presents the first distributionally robust optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization under $\ell_p$ norm uncertainty sets that covers nonconvex losses like neural networks. This framework allows fair inference even in the presence of distribution shifts between the training and test data.

3) The proposed methods are evaluated extensively on benchmark datasets and compared against several state-of-the-art approaches. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of the fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by the proposed methods across different batch sizes and in the presence of varying degrees of distribution shift.

4) An efficient open-source implementation of the proposed $f$-FERM framework is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and future research.

In summary, the main highlight is a unified, scalable, and robust optimization framework for imposing algorithmic fairness constraints that enjoys both theoretical convergence guarantees as well as superior empirical performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a unified methodology for fair empirical risk minimization based on $f$-divergence measures. Can you explain in more detail the intuition behind using $f$-divergences to promote fairness? What properties of $f$-divergences make them suitable for this task?

2) The paper shows that the proposed $f$-FERM framework covers several well-known fairness measures like demographic parity violation and Renyi correlation. Can you elaborate on why minimizing certain $f$-divergences leads to minimizing an upper bound on these fairness measures? 

3) The key idea in enabling stochastic updates for $f$-FERM is the use of variational representation and Legendre-Fenchel duality. Can you explain in more detail how this allows deriving unbiased gradient estimators? Why is having unbiased gradient estimators crucial for convergence guarantees?

4) Theorem 1 provides convergence rates for the proposed SGD-Ascent algorithm under different assumptions like strong concavity. Can you explain the proof technique to show convergence, especially bounding the variance of gradient estimators? 

5) For handling distribution shifts, the paper proposes an approximation technique based on Taylor expansion when shifts are small. Can you explain this technique and why the approximation is reasonable for small shifts?

6) For larger shifts, the paper exploits problem structure like convexity to reformulate the inner maximization problem. Can you explain in detail how the reformulation is done specifically for the KL divergence case?

7) The paper discusses extensions when either the sensitive attributes or predictions are continuous random variables. What are the main challenges in these settings and what techniques can potentially address them?

8) Can you think of other relevant $f$-divergence measures that were not explored in the paper but could have good fairness properties? How can the framework be extended to accomodate those?

9) The experimental section compares different $f$-divergences on benchmark datasets. Based on the results, what practical guidance can you provide regarding the choice of $f$-divergence?

10) The paper focuses on group fairness notions like demographic parity. How can the framework be extended for individual notions of fairness? What are the main challenges in ensuring individual fairness in a stochastic training setting?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models can make biased or unfair predictions against protected groups (e.g. based on gender, race). This is a major issue in deploying ML models in critical applications like healthcare, education, etc.

- Existing methods to impose fairness either 1) don't scale to large datasets (not amenable to stochastic optimization) or 2) don't handle distribution shifts between training and test data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents two frameworks:
  1) f-FERM: Imposes fairness by adding a regularization term based on f-divergences between the joint distribution of predictions and sensitive attributes, and the product of their marginals. Provides a variational reformulation to make it amenable for stochastic optimization.
  2) Robust f-FERM: Extends the above framework to handle distribution shifts between training and test data using ideas from distributionally robust optimization.

- For both settings, the paper provides theoretically convergent stochastic optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees.

Main Contributions:
- First unified methodology based on f-divergences for fair empirical risk minimization with stochastic algorithms
- Handles various popular notions of group fairness constraints
- Scalable to large datasets, works for any batch size
- Explicit handling of distribution shifts between training and test
- Convergence guarantees for optimization algorithms
- Extensive experiments demonstrating superiority over existing methods

The key idea is to use f-divergences to measure dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes, and impose it as a regularizer. The variational reformulation ensures amenability to stochastic methods. The framework is also extended to handle distribution shifts in a principled manner. Overall, this provides a scalable and robust approach to impose fairness constraints in ML models.
