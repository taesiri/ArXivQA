# [A Text-to-Text Model for Multilingual Offensive Language Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03379)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces FT5 and mFT5, the first ever transformer-based models using the T5 architecture that are pre-trained specifically for offensive language identification. FT5 is trained on English data from the SOLID and CCTK datasets, while mFT5 uses the same data to train a multilingual model. The authors employ semi-supervised learning techniques to optimize the selection and combination of training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark English and multilingual datasets demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art models like fBERT and HateBERT for both sentence-level and token-level offensive language identification. The multilingual mFT5 model also shows strong zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities. Overall, the T5 architecture allows amalgamating multiple datasets with different taxonomies without dependency on label sets. By releasing FT5 and mFT5, the authors significantly advance the state-of-the-art in offensive language detection while enabling new research opportunities in multilingual and low-resource scenarios.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FT5 and mFT5, the first ever text-to-text transformer models fine-tuned specifically for English and multilingual offensive language identification, which outperform previous state-of-the-art models on several benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An empirical evaluation of semi-supervised learning techniques that can be applied to train text-to-text models such as T5 and mT5 for offensive language identification.

2. A comprehensive evaluation of the effect of combining different datasets in pre-training text-to-text models. 

3. The first-ever cross-lingual evaluation of mT5 model in both high-resource and low-resource language settings for offensive language identification.

4. The release of the FT5 and mFT5 models, which are high-performing, state-of-the-art pre-trained models based on T5 for English and multilingual offensive language identification.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and release of FT5 and mFT5, which are the first ever pre-trained T5-based models for offensive language identification in English and multiple languages. The paper shows empirically that these models achieve new state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes FT5, the first pre-trained T5 model for offensive language identification. What are some of the key limitations of previous approaches like fBERT and HateBERT that FT5 aims to address?

2. The paper trains FT5 on two datasets - SOLID and CCTK. What are some of the key differences between these two datasets in terms of size, annotation schemes, and offensive categories? How does combining them benefit training the FT5 model?

3. The paper experiments with different SOLID STD thresholds and appending/not appending CCTK during FT5 training. What is the effect of varying the SOLID STD threshold on model performance? Why does augmenting training data with CCTK improve performance? 

4. The paper evaluates FT5 performance on both sentence-level and token-level tasks. What are some of the differences in how these two tasks are configured during fine-tuning of the FT5 model? Why is token-level evaluation also important?

5. The paper also proposes mFT5, the first multilingual pre-trained model for offensive language identification. What are some of the challenges in developing offensive language identification systems for low resource languages? How does mFT5 attempt to mitigate these?

6. mFT5 is evaluated on 6 languages spanning high-resource, mid-resource and low-resource settings. What differences do you observe in mFT5 performance across these language groups? What could explain these differences?

7. Both FT5 and mFT5 are compared against several baseline models. What baseline models are evaluated in the English and multilingual experiments respectively? How does the T5 architecture provide benefits over these models?

8. The paper evaluates mFT5 in a zero-shot cross-lingual setting without any language-specific fine-tuning. How competitive are the zero-shot results compared to the other baseline models? What does this indicate regarding mFT5's cross-lingual transfer capabilities?

9. Both FT5 and mFT5 are pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising framework. What are the advantages of this self-supervised pre-training approach compared to other strategies like masked language modeling?

10. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art results with FT5 and mFT5 across multiple benchmarks. What are some promising future directions and applications for these models that the authors discuss? What societal impacts could such offensive language identification systems enable?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Offensive content on social media is a growing concern and can have negative mental health impacts.  
- Most current offensive language identification models have limitations due to their encoder-only architecture which restricts labeling capabilities. 
- No existing pre-trained models effectively leverage multiple datasets or support multilingual offensive language identification.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a text-to-text pre-trained model called FT5 using the T5 architecture, trained on a combined dataset with over 2 million English tweets and posts.
- Also develop a multilingual model called mFT5 using the mT5 architecture trained on the same English data.
- Show FT5 and mFT5 outperform previous state-of-the-art models on both sentence-level and token-level English benchmarks.
- Demonstrate mFT5 achieves new state-of-the-art on 6 languages spanning high to low resource.

Main Contributions:
- First pre-trained T5 model for English offensive language identification which leverages multiple datasets.
- Analysis of semi-supervised data selection thresholds and dataset combinations for optimal T5 training.  
- New state-of-the-art results on English sentence and token-level benchmarks using FT5.
- First ever multilingual pre-trained model (mFT5) for offensive language identification across 6 languages.
- mFT5 sets new state-of-the-art on multilingual high and low resource benchmarks and shows strong zero-shot cross-lingual capability.
- Release of FT5 and mFT5 models to help advance future offensive language identification research.
