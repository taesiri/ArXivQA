# [GRF-based Predictive Flocking Control with Dynamic Pattern Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08434)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers are widely used to estimate attitude (orientation). However, existing methods like extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and complementary filter (CF) have limitations:
1) Sensitive to inaccurate initial state estimate
2) Require manual tuning of filter gains
3) Assume Gaussian noise

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) compensated EKF to address the above limitations
- The key idea is to add an RL-based correction step after the EKF update to compensate for residuals
- An RL policy is trained to learn the compensation gain from sensor measurements
- This allows the method to be robust to inaccurate initial estimates, work well even with non-Gaussian noise, and avoids manual tuning

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of attitude estimation as an RL problem by modeling the estimate residual dynamics as a Markov decision process
- Proposal of an RL compensated EKF algorithm with two correction stages - EKF update and RL update
- Theoretical analysis of the convergence of the estimate error
- Evaluation on simulated and real IMU data showing superior performance over EKF, CF and prior RL-based methods
- The method works well even with inaccurate initial estimates, inaccurate filter gains, and non-Gaussian noise

In summary, the key novelty is the introduction of a learned RL compensation policy on top of the model-based EKF to get a robust and tuning-free attitude estimation solution. Experiments validate the advantages of the proposed approach.
