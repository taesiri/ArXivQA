# [Can Transformers Learn Sequential Function Classes In Context?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12655)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper investigates whether transformers can learn from sequential, non-textual function class data distributions through in-context learning (ICL), in order to better understand the mechanisms enabling ICL in transformers. 

Methods:
- The authors introduce a novel sliding window sequential function class to generate sequential non-textual data.
- They train small GPT-2 architecture transformers on tasks based on this function class, including recursive bias, linear transformations, and 2-layer neural networks. 
- They also randomize the output labels in the training sequences to different degrees to evaluate model robustness.

Results:
- Transformers demonstrate effective ICL capabilities on the proposed non-textual sequential function tasks, providing evidence they can encode sequentiality patterns beyond just language modeling.
- Performance deteriorates more significantly with increasing label randomization compared to findings in past literature on textual tasks, suggesting the model has lower robustness on non-textual sequential data.

Conclusions:
- The key conclusions are that transformers can understand and leverage sequentiality in non-textual data through ICL, but are less noise-robust compared to language modeling tasks. 
- This implies fundamental differences in how transformers perceive and process textual versus non-textual sequential data patterns.
- Future work should further examine the role of proposed ICL mechanisms like induction heads as they relate to non-textual sequences.

Main Contributions:
- Novel sequential function class for non-textual ICL evaluation
- Demonstration that transformers can in-context learn non-textual sequences  
- Evidence and hypothesis of divergent ICL capabilities between textual and non-textual sequential data
