# [NeuralEditor: Editing Neural Radiance Fields via Manipulating Point   Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to enable neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to be natively editable for general shape editing tasks. The key insight is to leverage the advantages of both implicit neural representations like NeRFs, which can produce high-quality novel view synthesis, and explicit point cloud representations, which allow intuitive shape editing operations.The main hypothesis is that by generating precise point clouds to represent the underlying structure of a NeRF model, it will be possible to perform flexible shape editing by manipulating the point clouds, while still achieving high-fidelity rendering results.In summary, the central goal is developing a NeRF model that natively supports general shape editing via point cloud manipulation, combining the strengths of implicit and explicit scene representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing NeuralEditor, a flexible and versatile approach that enables neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to be edited by manipulating associated point clouds. Specifically:- The key insight is to leverage the benefits of both implicit neural scene representations (NeRFs) for high quality rendering, and explicit point cloud representations that are easy to edit. - NeuralEditor introduces a novel point cloud-guided NeRF model based on K-D trees and deterministic integration. This produces high fidelity renderings and precise point clouds that facilitate general shape editing operations.- NeuralEditor performs shape editing by mapping points between point clouds before and after deformation/morphing. This supports a wide range of editing tasks like shape deformation and scene morphing.- Extensive experiments show NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance on shape deformation and scene morphing tasks. It supports both zero-shot inference and fine-tuning on the edited scenes.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a flexible NeRF editing framework via point cloud manipulations, enabled by a novel point cloud-guided NeRF model and editing techniques. This advances NeRF's capability and applicability for general shape editing tasks.
