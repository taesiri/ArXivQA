# [NeuralEditor: Editing Neural Radiance Fields via Manipulating Point   Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to enable neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to be natively editable for general shape editing tasks. The key insight is to leverage the advantages of both implicit neural representations like NeRFs, which can produce high-quality novel view synthesis, and explicit point cloud representations, which allow intuitive shape editing operations.The main hypothesis is that by generating precise point clouds to represent the underlying structure of a NeRF model, it will be possible to perform flexible shape editing by manipulating the point clouds, while still achieving high-fidelity rendering results.In summary, the central goal is developing a NeRF model that natively supports general shape editing via point cloud manipulation, combining the strengths of implicit and explicit scene representations.
