# [NeuralEditor: Editing Neural Radiance Fields via Manipulating Point   Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to enable neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to be natively editable for general shape editing tasks. 

The key insight is to leverage the advantages of both implicit neural representations like NeRFs, which can produce high-quality novel view synthesis, and explicit point cloud representations, which allow intuitive shape editing operations.

The main hypothesis is that by generating precise point clouds to represent the underlying structure of a NeRF model, it will be possible to perform flexible shape editing by manipulating the point clouds, while still achieving high-fidelity rendering results.

In summary, the central goal is developing a NeRF model that natively supports general shape editing via point cloud manipulation, combining the strengths of implicit and explicit scene representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing NeuralEditor, a flexible and versatile approach that enables neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to be edited by manipulating associated point clouds. Specifically:

- The key insight is to leverage the benefits of both implicit neural scene representations (NeRFs) for high quality rendering, and explicit point cloud representations that are easy to edit.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in neural radiance field editing:

- It proposes a new method, NeuralEditor, for editing NeRFs by manipulating underlying point clouds. This allows more flexible editing compared to prior work like NeRF-Editing, Deforming-NeRF, and CageNeRF that rely on deforming meshes or cages. The point cloud integration is a novel idea.

- It introduces improvements to point cloud-guided NeRF modeling, including using KD trees and density-adaptive voxels for more efficient rendering, and modeling color with Phong reflection. This results in higher quality renderings and point clouds. 

- The method supports general shape editing tasks beyond just mesh deformation, including scene morphing between multiple NeRFs. Scene morphing is a new task not addressed in prior NeRF editing work.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on shape deformation compared to baselines, and produces smooth, realistic scene morphing. The visual results are quite strong.

- The method requires no extra supervision or data beyond the original NeRF training data. By contrast, some prior work relies on manually created meshes or cages.

- It supports both zero-shot inference and fine-tuning on the edited scenes. Fine-tuning further improves results. Other methods are more limited here.

- The paper includes more comprehensive experiments on shape editing over 8 scenes compared to just 1-2 scenes in prior work. It also releases code and data.

Overall, NeuralEditor seems to advance NeRF editing by using point clouds rather than meshes, enabling more flexible editing, high quality rendering of edited scenes, and new capabilities like scene morphing. The visual results and experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few key directions for future research:

1. Improving neural radiance field models: The authors note there is room for improvement in the rendering quality, efficiency, and generalization ability of neural radiance field (NeRF) models. Areas to explore include better network architectures, embedding spaces, regularization techniques, etc.

2. Advancing point cloud-guided NeRFs: The proposed NeuralEditor uses point clouds to enable shape editing with NeRFs. The authors suggest further developing point cloud-guided NeRF models, such as enhancing their robustness in handling complex scenes like those with reflections and transparency. 

3. Generalizing shape editing capabilities: NeuralEditor focuses on shape deformation and scene morphing. The authors propose extending shape editing capabilities to other tasks like scene composition, appearance editing, etc. This requires developing techniques to enable semantic editing at higher levels beyond just geometry.

4. Constructing datasets and benchmarks: The paper notes the lack of publicly available datasets and benchmarks for shape editing tasks. Creating such resources would promote further research in this area.

5. Evaluating scene morphing: Quantitative evaluation metrics are needed to properly assess the visual realism of scene morphing results. The development of appropriate metrics remains an open challenge.

In summary, the main future directions are improving NeRF models, especially point cloud-guided variants, generalizing shape editing capabilities, creating datasets/benchmarks, and developing better evaluation techniques for tasks like scene morphing. Advancing research in these areas can enable more flexible and powerful scene editing with neural representations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes NeuralEditor, a method for editing neural radiance fields (NeRFs) via manipulating point clouds.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes NeuralEditor, a flexible approach that enables neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to support general shape editing operations by manipulating underlying point clouds. The key insight is that NeRF rendering can be interpreted as a process of projecting or "plotting" an associated 3D point cloud onto the 2D image plane. NeuralEditor introduces a novel point cloud-guided NeRF model that uses K-D tree voxelization and deterministic integration to produce high-quality rendering and precise point clouds. It performs shape editing by simply moving points between point clouds of the original and edited scenes. Experiments show NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance on shape deformation tasks. It even supports challenging scene morphing between multiple scenes, which is difficult for prior NeRF editing methods.

Specifically, NeuralEditor renders scenes using density-adaptive voxels constructed with K-D trees and deterministic spline integration over the voxels. It models colors using Phong reflection and point cloud normals to improve geometry representation. The model optimizes the point cloud both explicitly through pruning/growing and implicitly by adjusting point confidence. For shape editing, NeuralEditor moves points between matched point clouds of original and edited scenes. It corrects view-dependent effects using infinitesimal surface transformations. NeuralEditor supports zero-shot inference on edited scenes as well as fine-tuning for improved consistency. Experiments demonstrate it produces high-fidelity rendering of deformed and morphed scenes, significantly outperforming recent point cloud-based and mesh-based NeRF editing baselines. NeuralEditor provides a general, performant approach to make NeRFs natively editable.
