# [PST-Bench: Tracing and Benchmarking the Source of Publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Tracing the source papers that significantly inspire or contribute to the key ideas/methods of a research publication is important for understanding the evolution of science. However, with billions of citation links between papers, it is challenging to identify these crucial links and reveal the core structure behind scientific progress. Existing datasets for this task are small-scale or lack diversity.

Proposed Solution:
The authors introduce PST-Bench, an accurately annotated and continually expanding dataset of 1,576 computer science papers mapped to their "ref-sources". It uses a novel crowdsourcing strategy - an online paper reading group - where dozens of graduate students regularly read papers and mark ref-sources. Ref-sources denote references that contribute indispensable ideas or methods without which the completion of the target paper would be impossible. 

The dataset contains rich attributes and enables in-depth analyses into the patterns behind paper source tracing graphs across topics like AI, databases, high performance computing etc. The authors also explore various methods like statistical methods, graph-based methods and pre-trained language models for automatic paper source tracing.

Main Contributions:
- Construct PST-Bench - the first accurately annotated, diverse and expanding benchmark for paper source tracing with 1,576 papers currently.

- Reveal intriguing discoveries from analyses, e.g. differing evolution patterns of papers across topics, references in high performance computing papers tend to be less cited on average compared to AI papers.  

- Explore multiple automatic tracing methods and demonstrate complexity of accurate tracing, necessitating more research in future.

The publicly available high-quality dataset can enable better understanding of scientific progress as well as research into automation of paper source tracing.
