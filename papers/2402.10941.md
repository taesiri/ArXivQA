# [Text2Data: Low-Resource Data Generation with Textual Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10941)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating data like images, audio, video, etc from natural language descriptions has gained increasing focus recently. However, areas with complex data structures or lacking textual labels like molecules, motions, time series suffer from low-resource issues. This limits supervised learning and applying advanced generative models for text-to-data generation. Existing solutions like data augmentation, semi-supervised learning and transfer learning have limitations. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Text2Data, a novel diffusion-based framework to improve text-to-data controllability under low-resource situations. It has two main stages:

1) Distribution Mastery: Leverage unlabeled data to discern overall data distribution via an unsupervised diffusion model. This captures data distribution without semantic ambiguity.  

2) Controllable Finetuning: Finetune the diffusion model on limited text-labeled data using a constraint optimization-based objective. This achieves controllability while mitigating catastrophic forgetting by regularizing parameters to remain close to those from distribution mastery stage.

Main Contributions:
- Propose Text2Data, a new framework to enhance text-to-data generation quality and controllability under low resource settings
- Design a constraint optimization-based learning objective for controllable finetuning to counter catastrophic forgetting
- Provide theoretical analysis to validate constraint selection and deduce generalization bounds
- Demonstrate Text2Data's superior performance over baselines on real-world molecular, motion and time series datasets regarding both generation quality and controllability

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in enabling text-to-data generation for low resource modalities by effectively utilizing all available data. The proposed Text2Data framework is adaptable for multiple generative model architectures.
