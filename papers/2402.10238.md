## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the application of machine learning methods to learn time-advancement operators for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The focus is on extending existing operator learning approaches like Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to handle additional inputs representing PDE parameters. The goal is to create a unified learning approach that can accurately predict short-term solutions and provide robust long-term statistics for simulations under diverse parameter conditions. This can facilitate computational cost savings and accelerate development in engineering domains involving parametric PDEs. 

Specifically, the paper looks at learning operators for unstable flame evolution in one and two dimensions, which is described by parametric PDEs. The parameters represent things like channel width which impact flame stability. Learning these operators is challenging due to the chaotic, nonlinear nature of flame dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes parametric extensions of FNO (pFNO) and CNN (pCNN) to incorporate the influence of PDE parameters. Both models take the PDE parameter as an additional input. The pFNO method introduces additional Fourier modes that capture parametric effects on different ranges of wavelengths. The pCNN extends the encoder to account for parameters. Both models are trained in a recurrent one-to-many fashion to ensure stability of learned operators.

The models are applied to learn flame evolution operators described by two 1D model PDEs - the Michelson-Sivashinsky (MS) and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equations, capturing distinct mechanisms of flame instability. The models are also applied on realistic 2D flame simulation data from direct numerical simulations.

Main Contributions:

- Proposal of pFNO and pCNN models to incorporate PDE parameters into operator learning frameworks 

- Demonstration of parametric operator learning on two distinct 1D flame models, accurately capturing short-term predictions and long-term statistics

- pFNO shows best performance overall in learning 1D flame operators, but pCNN better handles noise-affected unstable solutions

- Application of pFNO and pCNN on limited realistic 2D simulation data, successfully predicting flame evolution and new solutions from random initial conditions

- Provides insights into capabilities and limitations of parametric operator learning for chaotic flame dynamics, guiding future advancements

The paper demonstrates promising results in using parametric learning to accelerate simulations of complex phenomenon described by parametric PDEs. The proposed methods can capture short and long-term solution behaviors under varied conditions.
