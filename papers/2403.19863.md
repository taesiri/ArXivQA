# [DeNetDM: Debiasing by Network Depth Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19863)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks tend to learn spurious correlations in data, leading to biases and unfair predictions. For example, an image classifier trained on a dataset where young people are mostly female could incorrectly associate gender with age. Existing debiasing methods rely on having access to explicit bias labels or types which is expensive and impractical. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose DeNetDM, a novel debiasing method based on the key insight that shallow networks focus more on core features while deeper networks prioritize learning biases when tasked with acquiring distinct information. DeNetDM employs a Product of Experts approach with a deep biased branch and shallow debiased branch. The outputs are combined and trained to separate biases from core features. To compensate for the limited capacity of the shallow branch, a target debiased model is then trained using knowledge transfer from both branches.

Key Contributions:

- Analysis studying linear decodability of bias vs core attributes in networks of varying depths, revealing deeper networks emphasize biases more
- Introduction of DeNetDM debiasing approach involving paired deep-shallow network training and distillation to a target model
- State-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets without needing explicit bias supervision, improving by ~5% over previous unsupervised methods
- Empirical evidence that DeNetDM effectively utilizes diversity of bias-conflicting points, obviating the need for data augmentation used in other works
- Ablation studies validating the impact of depth difference, loss components, and parameter variations

In summary, this paper proposes a way to debias models by strategically using different network depths without requiring expensive bias labels. Experiments show superior performance over existing debiasing methods that rely on augmentation or reweighting strategies.
