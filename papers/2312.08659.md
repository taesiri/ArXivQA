## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents deep learning approaches for automated image-based detection and classification of plant diseases, specifically for tomato and corn plants. The key methods used are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image datasets from PlantVillage. The authors created additional datasets containing 1963 tomato plant images and 7316 corn plant images, divided into training, validation, and test sets. They evaluated four CNN models - Inception-V3, DenseNet-121, ResNet-101-V2, and Xception - and found Xception performed best for both datasets with over 92-95% validation accuracy. They also utilized batch normalization with CNN which further improved accuracy to 99%. Additional experiments involved modifying CNN architectures by adding layers, skip connections, and regularizations. On combined tomato and corn datasets, they evaluated other models like MobileNet, EfficientNetB0, and proposed a custom CNN architecture with competitive 84% test accuracy. Overall, the deep learning approaches reliably detected four tomato diseases and four corn diseases from leaf images, showing feasibility for automated plant disease recognition to assist farmers and agriculture. Key future work is expanding the model's capability to identify diseases in more crop varieties using aerial drone images.
