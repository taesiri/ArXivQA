# [Observation-Augmented Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits for Robotic   Exploration with Uncertain Semantic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12583)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots operating in uncertain environments (e.g. space exploration) must make sequential decisions about which options/actions to take to accomplish their goals. They would benefit from using extra outcome observations from external sources (e.g. humans) to help infer the expected outcomes of different options. 
- However, naive fusion of potentially erroneous external observations can degrade the accuracy of internal outcome distribution estimates and harm decision-making performance. Thus a method is needed to validate uncertain observations.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new "observation-augmented contextual multi-armed bandit" (OA-CMAB) framework where a robot can utilize extra outcome observations from sources like humans.
- Use "probabilistic semantic data association" (PSDA) to dynamically assess the validity of external semantic observations and robustly update internal outcome distribution estimates. PSDA maintains multiple hypothesis "mixands" to hedge against observation uncertainties.  
- Derive a generalized method to compute "expected free energy" (EFE) for active inference-based option selection that works with the multimodal mixand distributions produced by PSDA. Minimizing EFE balances exploitation and exploration.

Main Contributions:
- First framework enabling contextual bandit algorithms to leverage uncertain external outcome observations for accelerating decision making.
- Novel application of PSDA to provide robust measurement updates by explicitly modeling uncertainties in semantic data associations.
- Generalized EFE approximation technique for handling non-Gaussian mixand priors and multicategorical likelihoods common in semantic observation problems.
- Demonstrated improved decision making performance vs. state-of-the-art bandit algorithms in simulations of a deep space exploration scenario, even with a high rate of incorrect human observations.

In summary, the paper introduces an observation-augmented contextual bandit approach using probabilistic semantic data association and expected free energy minimization that can efficiently leverage uncertain external outcome observations to accelerate sequential decision making.
