# [Towards Self-Assembling Artificial Neural Networks through Neural   Developmental Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08197)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop artificial neural networks that grow through a developmental process similar to biological neural development, rather than being manually designed?The authors propose an approach called a Neural Developmental Program (NDP) to allow neural networks to self-assemble and grow from simple initial structures based on local communication between "neurons" alone. Their grand vision is to create systems where neurons can self-assemble, grow and adapt based on the task at hand, mimicking the developmental processes seen in biological neural systems. To explore this, they present two implementations of an NDP - one evolutionary and one differentiable. The NDP controls the growth of a policy network (that determines agent actions) by running in each neuron and deciding things like whether a neuron should replicate. The overall research question is about investigating whether these NDPs can produce functional neural networks through developmental growth, and comparing this approach to traditional hand-designed network architectures. The work represents initial steps towards more biologically-inspired developmental neural network growth processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction and initial investigation of Neural Developmental Programs (NDPs) for growing artificial neural networks. The key ideas are:- NDPs are models that control the developmental growth process of a neural network, operating based on local communication alone similarly to biological development. - Two instantiations of NDPs are presented - an evolutionary version and a differentiable version trained with gradient descent.- The NDP takes in node states and decides through learned functions if nodes should replicate, and how edge weights should be set. This allows growing neural networks from simple initial networks or single nodes.- The approach is evaluated on a variety of reinforcement learning and supervised learning tasks. While not achieving state-of-the-art, results show the feasibility of NDPs for growing functional neural networks.- The paper discusses how the developmental growth process guided by an NDP differs fundamentally from common neural network design paradigms and relates it to biological neural development. - The promise of the approach for enabling self-assembling, adaptive networks is highlighted as an area for future work.In summary, the core contribution is introducing Neural Developmental Programs as a new bio-inspired paradigm for growing neural networks through local interactions, instead of manually designing architectures. Initial experiments demonstrate the potential of this idea.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents a method called Neural Developmental Programs (NDPs) for growing artificial neural networks through a decentralized, self-organizing process inspired by biological development, and shows initial results applying NDPs to evolve networks on simple machine learning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of neural network growth and development:- It proposes a novel Neural Developmental Program (NDP) approach for growing neural networks, instead of manually designing them. This aligns with efforts to develop more biologically inspired approaches.- The NDP operates through local communication alone, allowing decentralized, self-organizing growth. This is different from methods like Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) that grow networks through evolutionary algorithms. - Two versions of NDP are explored - an evolutionary one and a differentiable one trained with gradient descent. This allows testing the idea in both black-box and end-to-end optimizable settings.- Experiments show NDP can grow networks competitive on RL and supervised learning tasks. Performance is not state-of-the-art but demonstrates feasibility of the approach.- Key limitations compared to leading work: the approach has only been tested on simple tasks so far and does not match performance of hand-designed networks. The encoding/decoding of information between genotype and phenotype is also simple currently.- The work is more conceptual and focuses on introducing the NDP framework. Follow up research would be needed to scale up the capabilities and benchmark rigorously against other developmental methods.- Overall, the work makes a novel contribution in exploring neural network growth based on bio-inspired development principles. But performance and scale is limited compared to state-of-the-art in the field currently. The potential impact would depend on how the approach is advanced in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Incorporating activity-dependent and reward-modulated growth and adaptation into the Neural Developmental Program (NDP). This would allow the network to shape itself dynamically based on the agent's experience and environment, similar to biological neural development.- Studying the interplay between the size of the NDP "genome", the number of developmental steps, and task performance. The goal would be to understand how to encode large networks efficiently while still achieving good performance after a reasonable number of growth steps.- Extending the approach to more complex domains and studying in more detail how the developmental growth process affects the types of architectures evolution can discover. This could reveal new insights about how biological neural development works.- Incorporating additional properties of biological neural development beyond just adding neurons/synapses, such as pruning connections, neural migration, and differentiation of neuron types.- Developing new training methodologies that take advantage of the full developmental process rather than just initializing with a grown network and fine-tuning. The developmental aspect could enable new ways to train and adapt networks.- Exploring whether developmental encodings can lead to more robust and generalizable networks compared to standard deep learning techniques. The self-organizing growth process may impart useful inductive biases.- Investigating whether the local communication-based NDP approach can be scaled up efficiently to very large networks required for challenging real-world problems.In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the biological plausibility of the models, scaling them up, and discovering new training paradigms enabled by the developmental growth process. The overarching goal is to move closer to AI systems that can self-assemble, grow, and adapt like biological neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces the idea of Neural Developmental Programs (NDPs) for growing neural networks instead of manually designing them. The key idea is that instead of directly encoding the weights of a neural network, an NDP specifies a set of developmental rules that allow a network to grow from a simple initial state through a decentralized, self-organizing process. The paper explores two implementations of NDPs - an evolutionary version and a differentiable version trained through gradient descent. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of NDPs on a range of reinforcement learning and classification tasks. While lacking state-of-the-art performance, the results show promise for growing networks that are shaped by the environment and task. The paper highlights that NDPs represent a step towards more biologically inspired developmental encodings that can potentially overcome limitations of current deep learning methods. The grand vision is AI systems capable of open-ended learning and self-modification.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces the idea of a neural developmental program (NDP) to grow artificial neural networks instead of manually designing them. The NDP is inspired by biological development processes and consists of a neural network that controls the growth of another neural network (the policy network). Starting from a minimal seeding graph, the NDP operates locally on each neuron to decide if it should replicate and how the weights of each connection should be set. The authors explore two different NDP implementations: an evolutionary version trained with CMA-ES, and a differentiable version trained with gradient descent. They demonstrate the feasibility of growing networks capable of solving simple reinforcement learning tasks like CartPole and LunarLander, as well as supervised learning tasks like MNIST digit classification. While lacking the performance of state-of-the-art methods, the NDP approach can learn to grow networks and policies that are competitive. This represents an initial step towards more biologically inspired developmental encodings that have the potential to overcome limitations of current deep learning methods in terms of robustness and generalizability. The authors highlight future work to incorporate activity-dependent growth based on an agent's experience, study the interplay between genome size and performance, and extend the approach to more complex domains.In summary, this paper proposes neural developmental programs as a new paradigm for growing neural networks through a decentralized, local process inspired by biological development. While preliminary, this opens up an interesting research direction for training neural networks through self-assembly and growth rather than manual architecture design and weight optimization. Future work is needed to improve performance and incorporate key properties of biological development like activity-dependent growth.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a neural developmental program (NDP) approach for growing artificial neural networks. The NDP is a graph neural network that runs in each neuron of a policy network and controls the growth process. It takes as input information from connected neurons and decides whether a neuron should replicate, as well as how connection weights should be set. Starting from a single neuron, the NDP iteratively grows a functional policy network through local communication alone. There are two versions presented: an evolutionary NDP optimized with CMA-ES, and a differentiable NDP trained with gradient descent. The approach is evaluated on RL benchmarks like CartPole and LunarLander, as well as supervised learning tasks like MNIST. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using an NDP to grow neural networks and policies that can perform competitively on these tasks.
