# [BiLoRA: A Bi-level Optimization Framework for Overfitting-Resilient   Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13037)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a popular method for fine-tuning large pre-trained language models by introducing low-rank update matrices to the model weights. Though LoRA methods effectively reduce trainable parameters, they suffer from overfitting to the training data, leading to sub-optimal generalization performance on test data. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes BiLoRA, a bi-level optimization framework to mitigate overfitting in LoRA methods. BiLoRA parameterizes the low-rank update matrices using pseudo singular value decomposition - as the product of pseudo singular vectors and values. It splits the training of these parameters into two levels:

Lower Level: Pseudo singular vectors are trained on a subset of training data, while fixing the pseudo singular values. This results in optimally learned vectors that depend on the singular values.

Upper Level: The optimally learned vectors from lower level are evaluated on the remaining training data. The resulting validation loss, as a function of singular values, is minimized to learn the values.

By partitioning the learning across data subsets and optimization levels, BiLoRA reduces overfitting to any single dataset.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel bi-level optimization approach that separates the learning of distinct parameter subsets of low-rank updates across datasets and optimization problems. This alleviates overfitting effectively.

- Demonstrates superior performance over LoRA, AdaLoRA and other methods across 10 datasets in language understanding and generation tasks. Achieves better generalization with similar parameter counts.

- Establishes connections to techniques like DARTS where architecture parameters are learned on a separate validation set to prevent overfitting. Conceptualizes pseudo singular values as 'architectures' in this analogy.

- Reduces overall training time compared to LoRA methods despite additional computations, by converging much faster. Opens up future work directions in automated rank selection.
