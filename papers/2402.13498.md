# [The Lay Person's Guide to Biomedicine: Orchestrating Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for automated lay summarisation (summarizing technical documents into plain language for non-experts) struggle with effective simplification and adding adequate background explanations. 
- Methods for automatically evaluating the "layness" (simplicity and understandability) of generated summaries are lacking.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper systematically explores using Large Language Models (LLMs like GPT-3) for both generating and evaluating lay summaries of biomedical articles, to address the limitations of existing methods.

- A novel "Explain-then-Summarise" framework is proposed that uses LLMs to first generate background explanations for technical terms, which are then fed into a supervised summarization model to improve lay summary generation.

- The ability of LLMs to perform zero-shot lay summarization (without any training data) is examined. 

- Two new LLM-based evaluation metrics of lay summary "layness" are proposed, which assess understandability from multiple perspectives.

Main Contributions:

- Showing LLMs can generate useful background knowledge to improve existing supervised lay summarization methods.

- Demonstrating LLMs have significant potential for high-quality zero-shot lay summarization.

- Proposing novel LLM-based evaluation metrics for assessing lay summary quality, which correlate better with human judgments than existing metrics. 

- Conducting the first detailed human evaluation protocol to assess multiple quality aspects of lay summaries.

- Providing insights into the advantages and limitations of using LLMs for both generating and evaluating lay summaries.
