# [LAMBADA: Backward Chaining for Automated Reasoning in Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13894)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: Can integrating backward chaining with large language models lead to improved performance on automated reasoning tasks compared to existing approaches based on forward chaining or end-to-end training? 

The key hypothesis is that combining backward chaining (a classical AI automated reasoning technique) with the natural language understanding capacity of large language models will enable more effective automated reasoning on tasks where the inputs and inference chains are expressed in natural language. 

The paper proposes a new model called LAMBADA that integrates backward chaining with large language model modules to perform automated reasoning. It compares LAMBADA experimentally to existing approaches like Chain-of-Thought and Selection-Inference on challenging deductive reasoning datasets. The main result is that LAMBADA substantially outperforms these baselines, especially on longer reasoning chains, demonstrating the benefits of incorporating backward chaining strategies into language model based reasoning.

In summary, the central research question is whether combining backward chaining with language models can improve automated reasoning with natural language, which the paper aims to validate through the proposed LAMBADA model and comparative experiments on reasoning datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing LAMBADA, a backward chaining algorithm for automated reasoning in natural language using language models. The key ideas are:

- Using backward chaining rather than forward chaining for proof search, as backward chaining is more efficient and goal-directed. The authors argue and show experimentally that backward chaining is better suited for text-based deductive reasoning compared to popular forward chaining approaches.

- Decomposing the reasoning into four modular components - Fact Check, Rule Selection, Goal Decomposition, and Sign Agreement - each implemented by an LM module through few-shot prompting. This allows combining the strength of LMs for natural language understanding with symbolic backward chaining for robust reasoning. 

- Showing significant improvements in accuracy over state-of-the-art methods like Chain-of-Thought and Selection-Inference on challenging deductive reasoning datasets, especially on examples requiring longer proof chains. The gains are particularly large on a dataset with more naturalistic text.

- Demonstrating the query efficiency, generalizability to longer chains, and lexical robustness of LAMBADA.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating a hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning algorithm LAMBADA that integrates goal-directed backward chaining with modular LM components for automated reasoning over natural text. The results strongly demonstrate the advantages of incorporating backward chaining into language model based reasoning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research on automated reasoning and logical deduction with natural language:

- Backward chaining algorithm: This paper proposes a novel backward chaining algorithm called LAMBADA for automated reasoning. Most prior work has focused on forward chaining or end-to-end reasoning. Backward chaining has been shown to be more efficient for automated reasoning in symbolic systems, but hasn't been widely explored for reasoning with natural language and large language models until this work.

- Modular reasoning: The paper proposes decomposing reasoning into separate modules handled by an LM, which contrasts with end-to-end or monolithic reasoning approaches. The modular design allows combining the strengths of symbolic methods like backward chaining with LMs. Related modular reasoning ideas have been explored in some prior work.

- Reasoning with natural language: A key focus is reasoning over natural language statements and rules, rather than purely formal logical representations. The proposed approach is evaluated on challenging natural language reasoning datasets. Most prior work has focused more on formal logical reasoning.

- Scaling laws: The paper provides analysis showing backward chaining combined with LM modules mitigates some scaling limitations of forward chaining, like combinatorial search spaces. This contributes empirical evidence about reasoning strategies for LMs.

- Accuracy improvements: Substantial accuracy improvements are demonstrated over state-of-the-art baselines relying on forward chaining or end-to-end reasoning. The gains are especially significant for problems requiring longer reasoning chains. This shows the promise of backward chaining for multi-hop reasoning.

In summary, the proposed backward chaining approach, modular reasoning design, and gains on natural language reasoning differentiate this work from prior research and contribute important insights on automated reasoning strategies with LMs. The empirical analysis also reveals limitations of prevailing approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Extending LAMBADA to non-classification cases, such as answering more open-ended questions that require logical reasoning. The current work focuses on classification problems of determining if a statement can be proved or disproved.

- Handling rules and knowledge that are not fully provided as explicit input, but need to be supplied by the language model itself. Currently LAMBADA assumes all relevant rules are given.

- Expanding the applicability of LAMBADA to datasets with more complex rules, beyond just modus ponens. The current work is limited to modus ponens for deduction.

- Exploring ways to make the calls to the language model modules more batchable, rather than strictly sequential. This could improve efficiency. 

- Using the traces and proofs generated by LAMBADA to further train or finetune smaller language models, to improve their performance with simpler prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought.

- Adapting the core ideas of backward chaining and goal-directed reasoning in LAMBADA more broadly to other NLP tasks requiring multi-step inference.

So in summary, some key directions are extending the approach to more open-ended and less constrained tasks, handling implicit knowledge, supporting more complex rules, improving efficiency, transferring knowledge to smaller models, and applying the core ideas more broadly.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new automated reasoning technique called LAMBADA that combines large language models with backward chaining logic for deductive reasoning in natural language. Backward chaining starts from the goal statement and recursively breaks it down into subgoals using inference rules until the subgoals can be directly proved or disproved from the facts. This avoids the combinatorial explosion of forward chaining methods. LAMBADA implements four main modules using prompted in-context learning with pretrained language models: Fact Check, Rule Selection, Goal Decomposition, and Sign Agreement. Experiments on challenging reasoning datasets like ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, and ParaRules show that LAMBADA substantially outperforms existing forward chaining methods, especially on longer inference chains. It also demonstrates better query efficiency and lexical robustness. The results indicate that incorporating backward chaining strategies enables more accurate and efficient automated reasoning compared to standard language model approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LAMBADA, a new algorithm for automated reasoning in natural language that combines the strengths of language models with backward chaining, a classical AI automated reasoning technique. Backward chaining starts with the goal statement and recursively breaks it down into subgoals using inference rules until the subgoals can be verified against known facts. The paper argues that backward chaining avoids the exponential search space issues of forward chaining methods and is better suited for language model reasoning. 

LAMBADA implements backward chaining using four language model modules for fact checking, rule selection, goal decomposition, and sign agreement. It is evaluated on challenging deductive reasoning datasets requiring multi-hop chains, including a natural language variant of ProofWriter. Experiments show LAMBADA substantially outperforms state-of-the-art language model reasoning techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting and the Selection-Inference algorithm. The gains are especially significant for problems needing longer, more complex inference chains. The paper demonstrates the promise of integrating classical and neural techniques for automated reasoning over text.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new algorithm called LAMBADA for automated logical reasoning in natural language. The key idea is to use backward chaining, where reasoning starts from the conclusion we want to prove and works backward to find supporting facts and rules. 

LAMBADA has four main components, each implemented by an LM module:

1) Fact Check: Checks if the goal can be directly proved or disproved by any of the facts. 

2) Rule Selection: Identifies rules whose consequent matches the goal.

3) Goal Decomposition: Breaks down the goal into subgoals based on the antecedent of the selected rule. 

4) Sign Agreement: Checks if the sign (positive/negative) of the rule and goal match.

These modules allow LAMBADA to recursively break down a reasoning goal into simpler subgoals until they can be verified against the facts. The backward chaining approach is more efficient than forward chaining used in prior LM reasoning methods, as it avoids searching a combinatorial space of inferences. Experiments show LAMBADA substantially improves accuracy over forward chaining methods, especially for deeper reasoning chains. The modular architecture also enables interpreting failures and leveraging stronger future LMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of performing automated reasoning and logical inference with natural language text. Specifically, it focuses on the task of deductive reasoning - determining whether a conclusion or goal statement can be proved or disproved based on a set of facts, rules, and background knowledge provided in natural language. 

The key issues and limitations it discusses with existing language model based approaches are:

- Scaling up language models provides limited benefits for complex reasoning problems, as shown by prior work.

- Simply finetuning language models on reasoning tasks makes them learn spurious correlations and does not lead to robust reasoning ability. 

- Existing prompting strategies like chain-of-thought struggle with proof planning and search for more complex reasoning problems requiring longer chains of inference.

- Most prior work uses a forward chaining reasoning strategy which suffers from combinatorial explosion of the search space as the number of inferences grows, often leading to failure in finding proofs.

The paper proposes a new approach called LAMBADA that incorporates backward chaining into language models to address these limitations. Backward chaining is a goal-directed strategy commonly used in classical AI automated reasoning, and helps constrain the search space and proof planning compared to forward chaining.

In summary, the key problem being addressed is enabling language models to perform sound logical reasoning and inference with natural text, by combining their strengths in language understanding with structured backward chaining based search.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using backward chaining augmented with language model modules as a better approach compared to forward chaining for logical reasoning. However, backward chaining can also suffer from combinatorial explosion as the search space grows exponentially with the depth of reasoning required. How does the proposed method deal with the exponential growth of the search space? Does it use heuristics or techniques like branch and bound to prune the search space?

2. The Rule Selection module selects rules based on unification of the consequent with the goal. However, selecting all rules whose consequent unifies with the goal can still lead to a large set of candidate rules. Does the method use any additional techniques to rank or filter the selected rules beyond just shortest rule first? Could relevance measures between rule and goal or confidence scores for each rule help?

3. The paper shows that the proposed backward chaining approach requires fewer inference calls compared to forward chaining methods like Selection-Inference. However, the modular design still requires multiple calls to the language model. Have the authors explored batching multiple module calls into a single query to further reduce total inference calls?

4. The method relies on a depth limit for halting and returning "Unknown" if no proof is found within the depth budget. How is this depth limit decided in practice? Does it require tuning on a dev set? Could more sophisticated heuristics for expanding most promising branches be helpful?

5. The four modules used for backward chaining use few-shot prompting with demonstrations. Have the authors experimented with other supervision approaches like fine-tuning or intermediate chain-level supervision? Would that improve robustness?

6. The paper focuses on formal deductive reasoning tasks with clean rules and facts. How will the approach perform on more open-domain or abductive reasoning where rules may be implicit and the theory incomplete? Would the modularity help or hurt in those settings?

7. The approach assumes access to perfect rules and facts. How robust is it against imperfect, ambiguous or even conflicting rules and facts? Do the modular components help isolate and contain such imperfections? 

8. How sensitive is the approach to the language used to express rules and facts? Since it relies on language model understanding, performance could vary across different linguistic expressions of the same logical theory.

9. The approach requires writing effective few-shot demonstrations for each module. How much effort goes into engineering those prompts? Can that effort be reduced with more systematic prompt design or meta-learning techniques?

10. The paper focuses on improving reasoning accuracy over prior work. How does the proposed method compare in terms of inference latency and computational requirements? Is there a accuracy/efficiency trade-off?
