# [DEUP: Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08501)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that model uncertainty/bias should be accounted for when estimating epistemic uncertainty, in addition to approximation uncertainty. 

The key claims made are:

1) Discrepancy-based measures of epistemic uncertainty (e.g. variance of the Bayesian posterior predictive) only capture approximation uncertainty and miss model uncertainty/bias. This can lead to poor uncertainty estimates and decisions when the model is misspecified.

2) The excess risk, defined as the gap between the generalization error and the Bayes error, captures both approximation and model uncertainty. It is proposed as a more robust measure of epistemic uncertainty.

3) A framework called DEUP is proposed to directly estimate the excess risk by training a separate model to predict the generalization error and subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty.

4) DEUP can improve optimization and exploration in interactive learning settings like sequential model optimization and RL compared to variance-based uncertainty measures.

5) The error predictor in DEUP can generalize its uncertainty estimates to out-of-distribution data by using additional "stationarizing" features related to density and model variance.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that epistemic uncertainty estimates should account for model uncertainty/bias and not just approximation uncertainty. DEUP is proposed as a way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a theoretical analysis of the sources of epistemic uncertainty and argues that model bias/misspecification should be accounted for, in addition to approximation uncertainty captured by variance. 

2. It proposes the DEUP framework which trains an error predictor to estimate the generalization error (excess risk) directly. Subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty gives an estimate of epistemic uncertainty.

3. It describes how DEUP can be adapted for interactive learning settings like active learning, sequential model optimization, and reinforcement learning. It proposes using stationarizing features like density, variance estimates, and an in-sample bit as inputs to the error predictor to make it robust to non-stationarities.

4. It provides experimental validation that DEUP's uncertainty estimates lead to improved performance on downstream tasks like SMO, exploration in RL, and OOD detection compared to variance-based Bayesian approaches. It also shows DEUP can estimate uncertainty well in a real-world drug synergy prediction task.

In summary, the key idea is to directly predict the generalization error using out-of-sample errors to get an estimate of epistemic uncertainty that captures model bias, unlike just using variance. The method is model-agnostic and shown to be useful across different interactive learning settings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points from the paper:

The paper analyzes sources of lack of knowledge (uncertainty) in machine learning models, argues that common Bayesian approaches largely ignore model uncertainty (bias), and proposes a framework called Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) which trains an error predictor to directly estimate a model's generalization error and epistemic uncertainty.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work on epistemic uncertainty estimation:

- It provides a theoretical analysis of the sources of lack of knowledge/epistemic uncertainty, arguing that model bias should be accounted for in addition to approximation uncertainty (variance). This is an important distinction from most existing work that focuses only on variance as a measure of epistemic uncertainty. 

- It proposes a principled framework (DEUP) for directly estimating epistemic uncertainty by predicting the generalization error. This is different from common Bayesian approaches that rely on the posterior variance, or ensemble methods that measure disagreement. It is more similar to recent work on predicting the loss directly.

- For interactive learning settings, it proposes using "stationarizing" features like density and variance estimates to make the error prediction more robust to distribution shifts during learning. This idea of conditioning on properties of the dataset seems quite novel.

- It aims to be model-agnostic, in that DEUP can be applied to any learner, Bayesian or not. Most existing approaches are tailored to specific model families like neural networks or Gaussian processes.

- The experimental validation is quite extensive, spanning areas like SMO, RL, drug discovery etc. Most papers focus evaluation on 1-2 domains. The results suggest DEUP uncertainty is useful across a diverse set of applications.

In summary, the key distinguishing aspects seem to be: 1) explicitly accounting for model bias in the theory of epistemic uncertainty 2) the DEUP framework to directly predict errors 3) the use of stationarizing features for handling distribution shifts and 4) model-agnostic formulation and extensive experimental validation. The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions to improving epistemic uncertainty estimation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several promising directions for future research:

- Investigating ways to improve the computational efficiency of DEUP. This could include exploring different choices of stationarizing features or alternate ways of incorporating the dataset as input to the secondary predictor.

- Developing methods to estimate aleatoric uncertainty when no estimator is readily available and one cannot simply query an oracle multiple times on the same input x. This would allow DEUP to estimate epistemic uncertainty in a wider range of settings.

- Theoretically studying the properties of DEUP under model misspecification. Understanding how misspecification impacts the error predictor and derived uncertainty estimates would be an important theoretical contribution.

- Applying DEUP to additional interactive learning settings like active learning and exploration in reinforcement learning. Scalability to more complex environments is also an important direction.

- Considering alternate loss functions beyond squared error for training the error predictor, which may capture epistemic uncertainty more effectively for certain tasks.

- Exploring the use of different stationarizing features beyond density, variance, and in/out of sample indicators. Other statistical properties of the training set may further improve uncertainty estimates.

- Leveraging alternate training strategies like meta-learning to make the error predictor generalize more effectively across main predictors and datasets.

So in summary, the main suggested directions are: improving computational efficiency, handling aleatoric uncertainty, theoretical analysis, expanded applications, exploring additional features and training techniques, and using alternate loss functions. Overall the paper points to many interesting ways DEUP could be extended and improved in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a framework called DEUP (Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction) for estimating epistemic uncertainty in machine learning models. The key ideas are:

- Standard measures of epistemic uncertainty like variance of the Bayesian posterior capture approximation uncertainty but miss out on model uncertainty induced by misspecification/bias. 

- The excess risk, defined as the gap between the generalization error and Bayes error, captures both approximation and model uncertainty. So estimating excess risk is a sound way to measure epistemic uncertainty.

- DEUP trains a secondary model called the error predictor to estimate the generalization error (risk) of the main predictor. Subtracting an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty gives the epistemic uncertainty.

- For interactive learning settings, the error predictor takes stationarizing features like density, variance as input along with the data point. This helps handle the non-stationarity induced by retraining the main model.

- Experiments show DEUP uncertainty estimates improve sequential model optimization and exploration in RL compared to baselines. DEUP also produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for classification and drug synergy prediction tasks.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled and flexible framework DEUP for estimating epistemic uncertainty by directly predicting generalization error, which captures both approximation and model uncertainty. The method is evaluated extensively across different settings like active learning, showing improved performance over standard Bayesian approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes the sources of uncertainty and lack of knowledge in predictive models. It argues that commonly used measures of epistemic uncertainty, like the variance of a Bayesian model's posterior predictive distribution, only capture approximation uncertainty due to limited data. However, they fail to account for model uncertainty arising from model misspecification or bias. The authors show that model uncertainty is an important component of lack of knowledge, and should also be considered when estimating epistemic uncertainty. 

To address this issue, the paper proposes a framework called Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) to directly estimate the epistemic uncertainty. It does so by training a secondary model to predict the generalization error (risk) of the main predictive model. The gap between this estimated risk and the irreducible aleatoric uncertainty provides a measure of epistemic uncertainty that accounts for both approximation and model uncertainty. Experiments on sequential model optimization, reinforcement learning, image classification and drug synergy prediction demonstrate that DEUP provides improved uncertainty estimates compared to common Bayesian approaches like MC-dropout. The explicit modeling of errors makes DEUP better suited for interactive learning settings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) for estimating epistemic uncertainty in machine learning models. DEUP trains a secondary model called an error predictor to directly estimate the generalization error or risk of the main predictor model. The error predictor takes as input the training data features along with additional "stationarizing" features like density estimates and model variance. The targets for training the error predictor are the out-of-sample errors made by the main predictor on points not included in its training set. At test time, the epistemic uncertainty is estimated by subtracting the predicted aleatoric uncertainty from the output of the error predictor. The method does not rely on Bayesian approximations and aims to provide improved epistemic uncertainty estimates that capture both approximation and model uncertainty. Experiments show DEUP uncertainty estimates can improve sequential model optimization and exploration in reinforcement learning compared to baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of estimating epistemic uncertainty in machine learning models. The key points are:

- Epistemic uncertainty refers to uncertainty caused by lack of knowledge, which can be reduced with more data. This is in contrast to aleatoric uncertainty which is irreducible. 

- Standard Bayesian methods estimate epistemic uncertainty using the variance of the posterior predictive distribution. However, this variance only captures approximation uncertainty and misses model uncertainty caused by misspecification or bias.

- The authors argue that model uncertainty/bias is an important component of epistemic uncertainty that should be accounted for.

- They propose measuring epistemic uncertainty using the excess risk, which is the difference between the expected loss of the model and the optimal Bayes loss. The excess risk captures both approximation and model uncertainty. 

- They introduce a method called Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) which trains a separate model to directly predict the expected loss or excess risk at a point. This predicted loss can be used as a measure of epistemic uncertainty.

- DEUP is applied in interactive learning settings like active learning, sequential model optimization, and reinforcement learning. It is shown to improve optimization and exploration compared to variance-based uncertainty methods.

So in summary, the key idea is to measure epistemic uncertainty using excess risk rather than just variance, in order to account for model misspecification effects. And DEUP provides a way to estimate this excess risk.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Epistemic uncertainty - A measure of the model's lack of knowledge, which can be reduced with more data. The paper argues that epistemic uncertainty should capture both approximation uncertainty and model uncertainty (bias).

- Excess risk - The gap between the generalization error of a predictor and the Bayes optimal predictor. Proposed as a measure of epistemic uncertainty.

- Model misspecification - When the Bayes optimal predictor is not contained within the model's hypothesis space. Can lead to bias and unreliable uncertainty estimates.

- Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) - The proposed framework to directly estimate the excess risk by training an error predictor on out-of-sample errors. Subtracts an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty.

- Aleatoric uncertainty - Irreducible uncertainty inherent in the data generating process. Estimated by the variance of replicate observations.

- Stationarizing features - Additional input features to the DEUP error predictor that provide information about the dataset, to tackle non-stationarity in interactive learning.

- Sequential model optimization - An interactive learning task where the model sequentially chooses inputs to evaluate based on high predicted values and uncertainties.

- Reinforcement learning - Another interactive setting where epistemic uncertainty guides exploration.

- Generalization error - The expected error on new unlabeled data, captures epistemic uncertainty. Used to evaluate DEUP.

In summary, the key ideas are directly estimating epistemic uncertainty through out-of-sample errors, accounting for model misspecification, and using stationarizing features to tackle non-stationarity in interactive learning settings. DEUP is evaluated on tasks like SMO and RL that require informative uncertainty estimates.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a principled framework called DEUP (Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction) for estimating epistemic uncertainty in machine learning models. Epistemic uncertainty captures the model's lack of knowledge and can be reduced with more data, unlike aleatoric uncertainty which is irreducible. The authors argue that existing approaches like Bayesian neural networks that rely on posterior variance tend to underestimate epistemic uncertainty due to model misspecification. Instead, they propose measuring epistemic uncertainty as the excess risk, i.e., the gap between the model's generalization error and the Bayes error rate. DEUP trains an "error predictor" to estimate the generalization error directly, and subtracts an estimate of aleatoric uncertainty to obtain the epistemic uncertainty. This approach does not rely on specific model assumptions, can work with any learning algorithm, and is robust to model misspecification. The authors describe how to train DEUP in both fixed dataset and interactive learning settings. Through extensive experiments on sequential model optimization, reinforcement learning, image classification and drug synergy prediction, they demonstrate that DEUP provides better uncertainty estimates than strong baselines, and using DEUP's uncertainties improves performance on downstream tasks. Key advantages are that DEUP can be explicitly trained to focus on frontier examples, handles distribution shifts, and decouples the main and uncertainty models. Limitations are increased compute costs and difficulty estimating aleatoric uncertainty. Overall, DEUP provides a promising new framework for estimating epistemic uncertainty in modern machine learning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper proposes a principled framework called Direct Epistemic Uncertainty Prediction (DEUP) for estimating epistemic uncertainty in machine learning models. The key ideas are:

- Epistemic uncertainty is a measure of the model's lack of knowledge, which can be reduced with more data. It consists of approximation uncertainty due to limited data, and model uncertainty due to model misspecification or bias.
