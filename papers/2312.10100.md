# [Data-Adaptive Dimensional Analysis for Accurate Interpolation and   Extrapolation in Computer Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computer simulations of complex physical/engineering systems are widely used, but building accurate statistical prediction models (surrogates) for these simulations is challenging. 
- Standard Gaussian process (GaSP) models for interpolation often fail badly when extrapolating predictions outside the initial input variable ranges.
- Statistical models may not properly account for the underlying physics and equations governing the systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Use dimensional analysis (DA) to transform the inputs and outputs into derived dimensionless quantities that obey the fundamental physical relationships.
- Choose the key DA variables guided by functional ANOVA, which quantifies the importance of inputs in explaining output variability in a GaSP model.
- Build the GaSP statistical surrogate model using these dimensionless DA variables instead of the original inputs/outputs.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that DA guided by FANOVA can lead to greatly improved prediction accuracy and extrapolation for GaSP models of computer experiments.
- Provides a systematic framework to implement DA for computer experiments using FANOVA and visualization of estimated effects.
- Achieves near perfect interpolation accuracy and remarkably good extrapolation accuracy in two complex case studies, representing physics-based computer simulations.  
- Shows the DA approach leads to accurate prediction even when extrapolating inputs far outside their original ranges in the training data.
- Establishes the critical role of choosing appropriate basis variables in DA to transform the system - guided here by FANOVA of original variables.
- Opens opportunities to further improve accuracy by using sequential DA-based designs after initial modeling.

In summary, the paper makes a strong case that DA based on FANOVA importance measures can overcome limitations of computer emulators and lead to valid, much more accurate statistical surrogates for complex simulation models. The framework presented also provides useful guidance about key choices required in DA implementation.
