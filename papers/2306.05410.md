# [LU-NeRF: Scene and Pose Estimation by Synchronizing Local Unposed NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05410)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to jointly estimate camera poses and scene representation from images without strong assumptions on camera poses or pose priors. The key hypothesis is that by taking a local-to-global approach and synchronizing local unposed NeRFs, the joint estimation of poses and scene can be made more tractable compared to trying to optimize everything globally from the start.The main limitations the paper aims to address with existing methods are:- BARF and GARF require good initialization of poses, within 15 degrees of ground truth.- NeRF--, X-NeRF, SiNeRF, and SaNeRF only handle forward-facing scenes.  - GNeRF and VMRF assume a limited 2D camera model (upright cameras) and require accurate prior distributions on poses.To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces a pipeline that:1) Partitions the data into mini-scenes and optimizes poses locally using LU-NeRF, without assumptions on pose priors or distributions.2) Synchronizes the local LU-NeRF estimations into a global frame using robust pose synchronization. 3) Refines the poses and scene globally after synchronization provides a good initialization.The key hypothesis is that by taking this local-to-global approach, joint pose and scene estimation can be made more flexible and applicable to broader settings compared to prior work.
