# [Dyna-LfLH: Learning Agile Navigation in Dynamic Environments from   Learned Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17231)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Navigating autonomous ground robots in environments with dense and dynamic obstacles is challenging. Classical motion planners struggle with limited onboard computation. Learning-based planners require high-quality demonstrations (for imitation learning) or extensive trial-and-error data (for reinforcement learning), both of which are difficult to acquire safely among dense and moving obstacles.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new self-supervised learning approach called Dynamic Learning from Learned Hallucination (Dyna-LfLH). It builds upon the Learning from Hallucination (LfH) paradigm which generates difficult navigation scenarios based on past successful experiences in easy environments. However, existing LfH methods cannot handle dynamic obstacles. 

Dyna-LfLH designs a novel latent distribution that models the obstacles' initial locations and velocities. It uses an encoder-decoder structure to learn to sample from this distribution to hallucinate dynamic obstacles that would make existing motion plans near-optimal. The generated data is then used to train a neural network motion planner in a supervised manner.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the "inverse" problem of hallucinating dynamic obstacles given existing motion plans 
- Models the dynamic obstacles using a latent distribution of their initial states and velocities
- Learns an encoder-decoder model in a self-supervised manner to sample varied dynamic obstacles 
- Generates training data from the learned model to train a neural motion planner
- Achieves superior navigation performance in simulation and on a physical robot compared to classical and learning baselines

In summary, Dyna-LfLH enables safe and sample-efficient learning of agile navigation among dense and fast-moving obstacles by learning to hallucinate appropriate dynamic environments given previous successful motion plans.
