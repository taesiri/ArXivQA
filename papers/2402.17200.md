# [Enhancing Quality of Compressed Images by Mitigating Enhancement Bias   Towards Compression Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17200)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for enhancing the quality of compressed images focus on aligning the enhancement domain with the raw image domain. However, they neglect the role of the compression domain, exhibiting an "enhancement bias" towards resembling the compression domain more than the raw domain. 
- This leads to two main issues: 1) Discriminators fail to distinguish compressed images from raw images, perceiving compression artifacts as realistic; 2) Enhanced images end up more similar to compressed images than raw images.

Proposed Solution:
- Employ a conditional discriminator with the compressed image as a condition, enabling clearer discrimination between enhancement and raw domains.
- Incorporate a domain divergence regularization to actively increase the difference between enhancement and compression domains.  
- This dual strategy facilitates discrimination against the compression domain and alignment of the enhancement domain closer to the raw domain.

Main Contributions:
1) Identify the issue of enhancement bias towards the compression domain which has been overlooked and adversely affects quality.
2) Propose a simple yet effective bias mitigation method that is model-agnostic and improves image quality without overhead.
3) Conduct comprehensive experiments showing significant improvement in quality metrics over state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key insight is to leverage the compression domain when enhancing quality, rather than focusing solely on the raw domain. By mitigating bias towards compression, the proposed method enhances alignment with the raw domain and image realism.
