# [NLP Progress in Indigenous Latin American Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indigenous languages in Latin America are at risk of extinction. Only around 5% of the population speaks native/indigenous languages.
- 88% of world's languages are overlooked in NLP research, leading to marginalization of indigenous communities. 
- There is a lack of NLP tools and resources for indigenous Latin American languages. Most research focuses on higher-resourced languages.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze current state of NLP research for indigenous Latin American languages 
- Identify challenges faced by researchers and communities in this space
- Survey researchers and indigenous language communities to understand needs and future directions
- Provide recommendations to researchers interested in working on these languages 

Key Contributions:
- Analysis showing NLP progress for 22 indigenous Latin American languages across countries and tasks  
- Statistics on publication venues, types and trends over time
- Identification of challenges such as lack of resources, community involvement, scientific effort
- Community perspectives on preservation needs - involvement, cultural sensitivity, education etc.  
- Future research directions suggested for various NLP tasks lacking attention 
- Takeaways on opportunities for researchers and communities to collaborate

In summary, the paper explores the current landscape of NLP research for indigenous Latin American languages, highlights critical gaps, presents community insights, and offers recommendations to drive more inclusive NLP progress in this important area.
