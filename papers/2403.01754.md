# [Derivative-Free Optimization for Low-Rank Adaptation in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 is computationally expensive as it requires computing gradients and backpropagation through the entire model. 
- Existing methods like LoRA are more efficient but still require gradient computation.
- Gradient-free methods like blackbox tuning of prompts help avoid backpropagation but can be unstable and slow to converge.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce low-rank matrices into each self-attention layer of LLM and optimize them using derivative-free optimization (DFO) methods. 
- Employ two DFO algorithms - CMA-ES and Fireworks algorithm to optimize low-rank modules at each layer alternately.
- Use a divide-and-conquer approach to treat optimization of each layer's low-rank modules as a separate subproblem.
- Introduce linear mapping matrices to enable DFO optimization and initialize them based on hidden state distributions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed a novel method to tune LLMs using DFO to optimize low-rank adaptations at each self-attention layer.
- Achieves better performance than gradient-based and gradient-free methods on GLUE tasks using RoBERTa and GPT-2.
- Reduces GPU memory usage and exhibits faster convergence compared to baseline DFO methods.
- Generalizable to larger models like GPT-2 XL and robust in few-shot settings.
- Eliminates need for gradient computation and backpropagation through entire LLM.

In summary, the paper presents a parameter-efficient and stable approach to tune LLMs by optimizing low-rank adaptations in a derivative-free manner, with empirical gains over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel method for efficient tuning of large language models by prepending low-rank modules to self-attention layers and optimizing them using derivative-free optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method for optimizing low-rank modules in large language models using derivative-free optimization. Specifically:

1) The paper inserts low-rank modules into each self-attention layer of a large language model. 

2) It then employs two derivative-free optimization methods (CMA-ES and Fireworks algorithm) to optimize these low-rank modules at each layer alternately, without needing to compute gradients.

3) This approach is shown to achieve better performance, lower GPU memory usage, and faster convergence compared to existing methods for few-shot learning on language models. 

4) The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on various language understanding tasks using models like RoBERTa-large, GPT2-large and GPT2-XL.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a novel way to efficiently fine-tune large language models for downstream tasks by optimizing introduced low-rank modules with derivative-free optimization, which has advantages over gradient-based methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Derivative-free optimization (DFO)
- Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) 
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Few-shot learning
- Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
- Fireworks Algorithm (FWA)
- Black-box tuning
- Parameter-efficient tuning
- Gradient-free optimization
- Self-attention
- Natural language understanding (NLU)

The paper proposes using DFO methods like CMA-ES and FWA to optimize low-rank modules prepended to each self-attention layer of large language models. This eliminates the need to compute gradients and backpropagate through the entire model. Experiments on NLU tasks demonstrate advantages over gradient-based methods like LoRA and other gradient-free methods in terms of performance, memory usage and convergence speed in few-shot settings. So the key ideas focus around combining DFO and low-rank adaptation for efficient tuning of LLMs.

4. The paper shows superior performance over gradient-based LoRA. What specifically allows the derivative-free optimization to find better solutions despite limited training data, compared to gradient-based methods?

5. How do the two proposed derivative-free optimization algorithms, CMA-ES and Fireworks algorithm, compare in terms of convergence speed, stability, and final performance? 

6. How does the method scale to even larger models than studied in the paper? Are there any constraints around model size or compute requirements?

7. Could the approach be extended to other model architectures beyond Transformers? What modifications would be required?

8. What is the sensitivity of the method to the choice of intrinsic dimensionality and rank parameters? How should these be set?

9. How do the computational and memory requirements of this method compare to existing gradient-free tuning approaches? Where are the efficiencies gained?

10. The method currently focuses on language understanding tasks. How would performance differ when applied to language generation tasks? What adjustments may be needed?
