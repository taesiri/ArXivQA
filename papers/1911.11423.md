# [Single Headed Attention RNN: Stop Thinking With Your Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11423)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research question this paper addresses is whether LSTMs can still achieve competitive performance on language modeling tasks when combined with a simplified attention mechanism, without the complexity of Transformer-style multi-headed attention. 

The central hypothesis is that an LSTM model augmented with a single-headed attention mechanism, dubbed SHA-RNN, can achieve strong performance on byte-level language modeling, approaching state-of-the-art results on the enwik8 dataset.

Specifically, the paper investigates whether:

- A simplified attention mechanism with a single head can boost LSTM performance significantly on language modeling. 

- This SHA-RNN model can reach competitive results on enwik8 using only a single GPU and minimal hyperparameter tuning.

- Attention-augmented LSTMs like SHA-RNN are still viable alternatives for language modeling compared to the dominant Transformer architectures.

So in summary, the key research question is whether a simple single-headed attention mechanism can allow LSTMs to remain competitive for language modeling, challenging the notion that multi-headed Transformer-style models are essential for state-of-the-art performance. The SHA-RNN model is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

- Proposing the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN) architecture for language modeling. This combines an RNN with a simplified single-headed attention mechanism and feedforward layers.

- Achieving strong byte-level language modeling results on the enwik8 dataset using the SHA-RNN, comparable to more complex Transformer models. The model achieves 1.068 bits per character on enwik8 using only 4 layers and 52M parameters.

- Showing that a single-headed attention mechanism can capture most of the gains of having multiple attention heads, while being more computationally efficient.

- Analyzing issues with comparing language models using different tokenizations, such as comparing word-level and subword-level models. The author argues this can enable "tokenization attacks" that artificially reduce the perplexity.

- Discussing the value of exploring alternate research directions beyond just scaling up parameter counts and compute, such as improving LSTM architectures.

- More broadly, advocating for developing a variety of model architectures rather than committing to a single approach like Transformers. The author argues the SHA-RNN shows LSTM models still have potential despite the recent dominance of Transformers.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and analyzing the SHA-RNN architecture as a way to achieve strong language modeling performance without the complexity of Transformers, while also discussing issues around evaluation and arguing for exploring diverse approaches in research.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The author proposes a Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN) that achieves strong byte-level language modeling results on the Enwik8 dataset with minimal hyperparameter tuning, suggesting LSTM models still have potential if combined with simplified attention mechanisms.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on comparing this paper on the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN) to other research in language modeling:

- The SHA-RNN draws inspiration from past work on LSTMs, continuous cache models, and Transformers. It combines aspects of these approaches into a novel architecture.

- The key innovation is using a simplified single-headed self-attention mechanism alongside an LSTM RNN. This allows it to achieve strong results on byte-level language modeling with minimal tuning.

- The results on enwik8 are competitive with state-of-the-art Transformer models while using far fewer parameters and less compute (a single GPU vs clusters). This demonstrates there is still room for other architectures besides Transformers in language modeling.

- The paper argues for exploring alternate research directions rather than just incrementally improving on Transformers. The SHA-RNN can be seen as an example of a different promising path.

- It also highlights potential issues with comparing models using different tokenization schemes, proposing the idea of "tokenization attacks." This contributes to the discussion of evaluating language models.

- Overall, the simplicity yet strong performance of SHA-RNN compared to giants like Transformer-XL suggests established techniques like LSTMs still have merit. The paper makes a case for not discounting past architectures as progress marches on.

In summary, the SHA-RNN offers a novel synthesis of existing ideas that achieves competitive results with modest resources. It serves as an example of exploring alternate avenues beyond the dominant Transformer paradigm. The paper's arguments and experimental findings provide useful perspective on the language modeling field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest several future research directions:

- Improving the efficiency and computational performance of the SHA-RNN architecture. The paper mentions that the implementation could be optimized at both low and high levels. Developing custom high-performance components like fast LSTM kernels could help.

- Exploring different tokenization schemes and datasets. The paper discusses issues with varying tokenizations across models and datasets. Constructing experiments to properly demonstrate the impact of tokenization choices would be useful. Creating a new Wikipedia dataset with improved tokenization is also suggested.

- Investigating extensions and variations of the SHA-RNN model. The single-headed attention mechanism could be explored further. Alternative RNN cells besides LSTMs could also be tested.

- Comparing SHA-RNN to other architectures like Transformers and SVMs on additional tasks. The model was only evaluated on language modeling here, but could be applied to other NLP problems. Direct comparison to other models would help understand tradeoffs.

- Developing techniques to make training wild experiments easier and better supported. The paper discusses challenges with implementing custom high performance components. Improving frameworks to enable novel model architectures is recommended. 

- Analyzing model distillation and transfer learning using SHA-RNN. The paper suggests the model could be a good basis for distillation techniques to compress knowledge.

- Applying SHA-RNN to domains beyond text such as computer vision. Evaluating the model's capabilities on multimodal problems is suggested.

In summary, the main future directions are improving SHA-RNN's efficiency, testing variations of the architecture, analyzing its generalization capabilities, and facilitating exploration of novel models in general. Developing better datasets, tokenization schemes, training techniques, and frameworks are also highlighted.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new neural network architecture called the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN) for language modeling. The model consists of an RNN with a simplified single-head attention mechanism and feedforward layers. It is designed to be computationally efficient while still capturing long range dependencies in text. Experiments are conducted on the byte-level Enwik8 dataset and the word-level WikiText-103 dataset. The SHA-RNN achieves strong results on Enwik8, reaching 1.068 bits per character on the test set which is close to state-of-the-art despite minimal hyperparameter tuning. This demonstrates the viability of RNN-based models with limited attention for language modeling. The author argues that the field may have dismissed RNNs prematurely in favor of Transformer models. The paper also introduces the concept of "tokenization attacks" where changing the tokenization scheme (e.g. words vs wordpieces) can enable models to game perplexity metrics. Overall, the SHA-RNN serves as a counterpoint to the dominant Transformer architecture and suggests there are still opportunities for exploration with RNNs combined with simple attention mechanisms.

In summary, this paper proposes a new RNN architecture with limited attention called SHA-RNN that achieves strong language modeling performance. The author argues RNNs should not be dismissed entirely in favor of Transformer models, and introduces the idea of tokenization attacks that can artificially improve perplexity. The SHA-RNN demonstrates RNNs still have potential, especially when combined judiciously with attention.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on the paper, the main method used is a recurrent neural network architecture called the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN). The SHA-RNN combines an RNN with a simplified single-headed attention mechanism and a feedforward layer (called a Boom layer). 

Specifically, the model consists of:

- An embedding layer 
- One or more layers of a stacked SHA-RNN
- A softmax classifier

The SHA-RNN uses a single attention head, similar to a continuous cache or pointer sentinel mechanism, which allows extending the memory context indefinitely with minimal overhead. The model also utilizes a Boom feedforward layer, which is a modified feedforward layer like in Transformers. 

The overall architecture aims to achieve strong language modeling performance with a simpler approach compared to large Transformer models. Experiments on byte-level text modeling on the Enwik8 dataset show the SHA-RNN achieves competitive results to Transformer models while using less parameters and training on a single GPU.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of language modeling through a novel neural network architecture called the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN). The key points from the paper are:

- Language modeling is predicting the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. It is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and captures a lot of linguistic knowledge.

- Recently, Transformer models with multi-head attention have dominated language modeling. The paper argues we may have been too quick to discard past models like LSTMs. 

- It proposes the SHA-RNN which combines an LSTM, a simplified single-head attention mechanism, and a feedforward layer. This model achieves strong results on byte-level language modeling, close to state-of-the-art Transformer results.

- The attention mechanism used is lightweight, with a single head and fixed memory. This is simpler than the many heads used in Transformers.

- The model was developed and trained on a single GPU, showing you don't need huge compute to get good results. Minimal hyperparameter tuning was done.

- The paper argues we should keep exploring diversity in model architectures rather than all crowd on a single direction like Transformers. The SHA-RNN shows LSTM models still have promise.

- It also raises issues with comparing models trained on different tokenizations, which can greatly affect perplexity.

In summary, the SHA-RNN challenges the notion that multi-head Transformer models are unconditionally superior for language modeling. It shows strong results can be achieved with a simpler LSTM-based architecture, providing an alternate path forward.
