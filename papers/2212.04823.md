# [GazeNeRF: 3D-Aware Gaze Redirection with Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we formulate gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem to improve redirection accuracy and generate more photorealistic redirected images?

The key points are:

- Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate consistent 3D results. 

- The authors propose to reformulate gaze redirection as a 3D task by leveraging recent advances in image-based conditional neural radiance fields.

- They propose a two-stream MLP architecture to model the face and eyes as separate 3D structures with separate neural radiance fields. 

- Rigidly rotating the eye features and compositing with the untransformed face features allows fine-grained control over gaze redirection.

- Experiments show this 3D-aware approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art 2D methods in redirection accuracy while preserving identity.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling gaze redirection as a 3D-aware volumetric problem with explicit disentanglement and transformation of eye features can improve redirection performance. The proposed GazeNeRF method aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Reformulating the task of gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem by leveraging neural radiance fields. Previous methods formulate gaze redirection as 2D image manipulation, which can lead to inconsistencies. 

2. Proposing a novel two-stream MLP architecture called GazeNeRF that predicts separate feature volumes for the eye region and rest of the face. This allows disentangling and independently transforming the eyes and face.

3. Applying an explicit 3D rotation on the eye feature volume based on the target gaze direction. This injects a strong 3D prior and models the natural rotation of eyeballs. 

4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in gaze redirection accuracy while preserving identity on multiple datasets. Experiments show advantages over previous 2D methods and naive NeRF approaches.

In summary, the key ideas are reformulating gaze redirection as a 3D-aware volumetric problem, proposing an architecture to disentangle face and eye features, and leveraging explicit 3D transformations on the eyeballs. The results show improved performance and consistency compared to prior 2D and 3D approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a 3D-aware gaze redirection method called GazeNeRF that leverages neural radiance fields to separately model the face and eye regions, allowing rigid transformation of the eye features to redirect gaze while preserving facial identity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some key ways this research compares to other work in gaze redirection:

- It takes a 3D-aware approach using neural radiance fields, whereas most prior work formulates gaze redirection as a 2D image manipulation problem. This allows the method to better model the underlying 3D structure and movement of faces and eyes.

- It proposes a two-stream architecture that separately models the face and eye regions, allowing for explicit disentanglement and rigid rotation of the eyeball features. Other methods typically take a more holistic approach without this separation.

- It achieves state-of-the-art performance in gaze redirection accuracy across multiple datasets while better preserving identity. Many previous methods struggle with identity preservation or sacrificing accuracy.

- The use of neural radiance fields allows generating higher quality and more realistic redirected images compared to approaches relying on warping or 2D generative models.

- The method requires less training data compared to other 3D-aware approaches like EyeNeRF. It is trained from images without requiring multi-view video capture.

Overall, the key innovations seem to be in formulating gaze redirection as a 3D volumetric problem and leveraging implicit neural scene representations to achieve better redirection accuracy and realism while requiring less training data than some other 3D-aware techniques. The explicit modeling of eyes and faces is also a unique aspect not seen in prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Reducing the training time burden of NeRF-based models like GazeNeRF. The authors mention this is a limitation of their method that could be addressed in future work.

- Exploring other potential applications and benefits of the 3D-aware gaze redirection enabled by GazeNeRF. For example, using it to generate training data for other tasks like gaze estimation.

- Investigating other ways to incorporate 3D structure and awareness into gaze redirection beyond their two-stream MLP approach. This could lead to further improvements in accuracy.

- Extending the method to model and redirect other aspects of facial appearance and motion beyond just gaze. The disentangled volumetric feature representation could potentially enable control over facial expressions, poses, etc.

- Validating the approach on even more diverse datasets to further demonstrate generalization ability.

- Combining the method with other state-of-the-art generative models like GANs to inherit additional benefits in terms of image quality and detail.

- Exploring unsupervised or self-supervised training regimes to reduce reliance on paired ground truth data.

So in summary, the core suggestions are around 1) improving efficiency, 2) enhancing 3D-awareness, 3) extending controllable modeling beyond gaze redirection, and 4) reducing supervision needs - all aimed at unlocking more applications for photorealistic facial appearance manipulation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GazeNeRF, a 3D-aware method for gaze redirection. Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate consistent 3D results. In contrast, GazeNeRF leverages recent advances in image-based conditional neural radiance fields. It uses a two-stream architecture that separately predicts volumetric features for the face region and eyes. The eye features are rigidly rotated via a 3D rotation matrix to control gaze direction. The face and rotated eye features are then composed to render the final redirected image via volumetric rendering. Experiments show this approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art 2D methods in gaze redirection accuracy while preserving identity, demonstrating the advantage of formulating gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem. The key advantages are the novel two-stream MLP structure to disentangle eye and face features, and the application of explicit 3D rotations to the eye features. This allows accurate and explicit control over gaze redirection in a 3D-consistent manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GazeNeRF, a 3D-aware method for gaze redirection. Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate consistent 3D results. The key idea is that the face and eyes are separate 3D structures that can move independently. GazeNeRF leverages recent advances in image-based conditional neural radiance fields. It uses a two-stream architecture with separate MLPs to predict volumetric features for the face and eyes regions. The eye features are rigidly transformed via a 3D rotation matrix to provide control over the gaze direction. The final redirected image is generated via differentiable volume rendering and compositing of the face and eye features. 

GazeNeRF is evaluated on multiple datasets and outperforms previous 2D gaze redirection methods in terms of accuracy and identity preservation. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance by explicitly modeling the 3D nature of gaze redirection. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of the two-stream design and 3D-aware transformations. The ability to disentangle and independently transform face and eye features leads to improved redirection fidelity. The paper makes a case for formulating gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem and demonstrates a novel neural volume rendering approach to achieve this.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading, the main method proposed in this paper is a 3D-aware gaze redirection approach called GazeNeRF. The key ideas are:

- It leverages recent advances in conditional neural radiance fields (NeRF) to generate high-quality face images. 

- It uses a two-stream MLP architecture to separately model the face region (without eyes) and eyeballs as two distinct 3D structures. This allows disentangling and independent manipulation.

- The eyeball features are transformed via a 3D rotation matrix based on the target gaze direction. This enables explicit rigid rotation of the eyes. 

- The transformed eye features and untransformed face features are merged via element-wise maximum. 

- The final gaze redirected image is rendered differentiably via volumetric compositing and neural rendering.

- Additional losses like reconstruction, perceptual, functional and disentanglement losses are used to train the model end-to-end.

In summary, the key novelty is the use of 3D-aware modeling via two-stream NeRF and explicit 3D rotation of the eyeballs for accurate and identity-preserving gaze redirection. This contrasts prior 2D image-based gaze redirection methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The authors propose a novel 3D-aware gaze redirection method called GazeNeRF that leverages recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Their key insight is that the face and eyes are separate 3D structures that can move independently. 

- GazeNeRF uses a two-stream MLP architecture to separately model the face region and eyeballs as volumetric features. The eye features are then transformed via a 3D rotation matrix to achieve the desired gaze direction before compositing the face.

- This explicit 3D rotation of the disentangled eyeball features gives GazeNeRF an advantage in redirection accuracy over prior 2D methods and naively conditioned NeRF baselines.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance of GazeNeRF in gaze redirection across multiple datasets while preserving identity, highlighting the benefits of formulating gaze redirection as a 3D-aware volumetric rendering task.

 Here is a high-quality one paragraph summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes GazeNeRF, a novel 3D-aware method for gaze redirection that leverages recent advances in image-based conditional neural radiance fields. The key idea is to model the face and eyes as separate 3D structures with two neural radiance field streams. This allows applying a 3D rotation to the eye features based on the desired gaze angle while keeping the rest of the face fixed, providing fine-grained control. GazeNeRF consists of two-stream MLPs that predict features for the face and eyes separately. The eye features are transformed via a rigid 3D rotation matrix defined by the target gaze direction. The features are merged and rendered into the final redirected image via differentiable volumetric compositing. Experiments demonstrate that explicitly modeling and transforming the eyes in 3D space results in more accurate gaze redirection while better preserving identity compared to prior 2D gaze redirection techniques.

The paper proposes GazeNeRF, a 3D-aware gaze redirection method using neural radiance fields. It argues that existing 2D gaze redirection methods struggle to generate consistent 3D results.
