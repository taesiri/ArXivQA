# [GazeNeRF: 3D-Aware Gaze Redirection with Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we formulate gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem to improve redirection accuracy and generate more photorealistic redirected images?

The key points are:

- Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate consistent 3D results. 

- The authors propose to reformulate gaze redirection as a 3D task by leveraging recent advances in image-based conditional neural radiance fields.

- They propose a two-stream MLP architecture to model the face and eyes as separate 3D structures with separate neural radiance fields. 

- Rigidly rotating the eye features and compositing with the untransformed face features allows fine-grained control over gaze redirection.

- Experiments show this 3D-aware approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art 2D methods in redirection accuracy while preserving identity.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling gaze redirection as a 3D-aware volumetric problem with explicit disentanglement and transformation of eye features can improve redirection performance. The proposed GazeNeRF method aims to test this hypothesis.
