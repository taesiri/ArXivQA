# [GazeNeRF: 3D-Aware Gaze Redirection with Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we formulate gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem to improve redirection accuracy and generate more photorealistic redirected images?

The key points are:

- Existing gaze redirection methods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate consistent 3D results. 

- The authors propose to reformulate gaze redirection as a 3D task by leveraging recent advances in image-based conditional neural radiance fields.

- They propose a two-stream MLP architecture to model the face and eyes as separate 3D structures with separate neural radiance fields. 

- Rigidly rotating the eye features and compositing with the untransformed face features allows fine-grained control over gaze redirection.

- Experiments show this 3D-aware approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art 2D methods in redirection accuracy while preserving identity.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling gaze redirection as a 3D-aware volumetric problem with explicit disentanglement and transformation of eye features can improve redirection performance. The proposed GazeNeRF method aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Reformulating the task of gaze redirection as a 3D-aware problem by leveraging neural radiance fields. Previous methods formulate gaze redirection as 2D image manipulation, which can lead to inconsistencies. 

2. Proposing a novel two-stream MLP architecture called GazeNeRF that predicts separate feature volumes for the eye region and rest of the face. This allows disentangling and independently transforming the eyes and face.

3. Applying an explicit 3D rotation on the eye feature volume based on the target gaze direction. This injects a strong 3D prior and models the natural rotation of eyeballs. 

4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in gaze redirection accuracy while preserving identity on multiple datasets. Experiments show advantages over previous 2D methods and naive NeRF approaches.

In summary, the key ideas are reformulating gaze redirection as a 3D-aware volumetric problem, proposing an architecture to disentangle face and eye features, and leveraging explicit 3D transformations on the eyeballs. The results show improved performance and consistency compared to prior 2D and 3D approaches.
