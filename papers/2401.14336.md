# [Progressive Multi-task Anti-Noise Learning and Distilling Frameworks for   Fine-grained Vehicle Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-grained vehicle recognition (FGVR) aims to classify vehicle images into fine-grained categories like specific models and years. It is an important technology with applications such as detecting vehicles with fake license plates.  
- However, FGVR faces the challenge of large intra-class variation, which refers to high visual variability between images of the same vehicle model.
- Most prior FGVR works focus on intra-class variation caused by viewpoint, vehicle position, etc. Intra-class variation caused by image noise is largely ignored. 
- Image noise can drastically affect CNN performance on FGVR, even though the noise may be imperceptible to humans. This is problematic since real-world vehicle images commonly contain noise.

Proposed Solution:
- A progressive multi-task anti-noise learning (PMAL) framework that trains CNNs to jointly perform recognition and image denoising in a progressive manner from shallow to deep layers. This forces noise invariance at all levels.
- A progressive multi-task distilling (PMD) framework that transfers knowledge from a PMAL-trained teacher network into a student network with the original CNN architecture. This retains accuracy improvements without additional overheads.
- Sharpness-aware minimization is introduced during optimization of each task to prevent convergence to suboptimal solutions.

Contributions:
- First work to focus specifically on mitigating noise-based intra-class variation for FGVR.
- PMAL framework that uses image denoising as an auxiliary task, progressively trained from shallow to deep layers, to learn noise-invariant features.
- PMD framework to transfer knowledge from PMAL-trained teacher into student network with original architecture, retaining accuracy improvements without overheads.  
- Experiments show clear state-of-the-art accuracy improvements on Stanford Cars, CompCars, BIT-Vehicle, VTID2 and VIDMMR datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes novel progressive multi-task learning frameworks to learn noise-invariant discriminative features for advancing FGVR accuracy, with distillation to retain benefits in original network architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes progressive multi-task anti-noise learning and distilling frameworks to address the intra-class variation caused by image noise in fine-grained vehicle recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It focuses on solving the intra-class variation problem in fine-grained vehicle recognition (FGVR) caused by image noise, which has received little attention from previous FGVR studies. 

2) It proposes a progressive multi-task anti-noise learning (PMAL) framework that treats image denoising as an additional task to force the model to learn noise invariance, achieving high recognition accuracy.

3) It proposes a progressive multi-task distilling (PMD) framework that transfers the knowledge learned by the PMAL-trained model to the original backbone network. This yields a model with similar accuracy to the PMAL-trained model but without additional overheads beyond the backbone network.

4) By combining the PMAL and PMD frameworks, the paper obtains models that clearly exceed previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy on standard FGVR datasets Stanford Cars and CompCars, as well as three additional surveillance image datasets, without introducing additional computational burden compared to the original backbone networks.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel approach to addressing the image noise caused intra-class variation problem in FGVR via progressive multi-task learning frameworks, which pushes accuracy beyond prior arts without additional computational overheads.
