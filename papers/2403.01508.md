# [Soft Reasoning on Uncertain Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to represent factual knowledge, but often contain uncertainty and incompleteness. 
- Existing methods for reasoning on KGs using logic queries assume complete and certain knowledge.
- This paper studies reasoning on uncertain and incomplete KGs, which is an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new setting called "Soft Queries on Uncertain Knowledge Graphs (SQUK)". 
- SQUK extends logical queries with "soft requirements" like necessity and importance to handle uncertainty.
- A machine learning approach called "Soft Reasoning with calibrated Confidence values (SRC)" is proposed to answer soft queries on uncertain KGs.
- SRC uses pre-trained "Uncertain KG Embeddings" to handle missing facts and calibrate the confidence values.
- Theoretical analysis shows SRC shares complexity with state-of-the-art methods and the error can be controlled.
- Two strategies are used to calibrate confidence values: debiasing and learning.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the new problem of soft queries on uncertain KGs.
- Proposes the SRC framework with theoretical guarantees to enable soft reasoning.  
- Constructs datasets with soft queries on standard uncertain KGs.
- Empirically demonstrates SRC outperforms strong baselines like query embeddings with number embeddings.
- Makes comparisons with large language models, showing the advantage of specialized reasoning.

In summary, the paper opens up the capability of handling uncertainty in reasoning over incomplete KGs, with both theoretical and empirical support. The concepts and dataset provide a foundation for future research.
