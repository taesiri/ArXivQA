# [AI for bureaucratic productivity: Measuring the potential of AI to help   automate 143 million UK government transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is excitement about using AI to improve government productivity by automating complex bureaucratic tasks, but it's unclear where specifically the opportunities are and how much potential savings exist.  
- Past research hasn't empirically measured the scale and structure of bureaucratic processes in government to identify automation opportunities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper maps out and measures the scale of citizen-facing bureaucratic decision-making transactions across UK central government organizations.
- It estimates the volume of transactions through different services and evaluates their amenability to automation using an Automatability of Service Tasks (AST) index.
- It also proposes a Potential for Generative AI (PGenAI) rubric to assess if emerging generative AI could help automate traditionally "non-automatable" tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies 377 citizen-facing services conducted by UK central government, totaling ~965 million transactions per year.
- Estimates that of these, 143 million are complex, repetitive bureaucratic transactions conducted by 201 services.
- Finds 84% of those complex transactions are highly automatable per the AST index, representing major potential efficiency gains.
- Develops a model to estimate transaction volumes from web traffic data, avoiding extensive manual measurements.
- The PGenAI rubric finds most surveyed "non-automatable" services still have medium potential from generative AI.
- Concludes there is very significant potential to apply AI to streamline bureaucratic government transactions and improve productivity.

In summary, the paper provides a granular quantification of the automation opportunity in UK government transactions and tools to identify the most amenable areas, highlighting major potential gains in efficiency and productivity from deploying AI.
