# [AI for bureaucratic productivity: Measuring the potential of AI to help   automate 143 million UK government transactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14712)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is excitement about using AI to improve government productivity by automating complex bureaucratic tasks, but it's unclear where specifically the opportunities are and how much potential savings exist.  
- Past research hasn't empirically measured the scale and structure of bureaucratic processes in government to identify automation opportunities.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper maps out and measures the scale of citizen-facing bureaucratic decision-making transactions across UK central government organizations.
- It estimates the volume of transactions through different services and evaluates their amenability to automation using an Automatability of Service Tasks (AST) index.
- It also proposes a Potential for Generative AI (PGenAI) rubric to assess if emerging generative AI could help automate traditionally "non-automatable" tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies 377 citizen-facing services conducted by UK central government, totaling ~965 million transactions per year.
- Estimates that of these, 143 million are complex, repetitive bureaucratic transactions conducted by 201 services.
- Finds 84% of those complex transactions are highly automatable per the AST index, representing major potential efficiency gains.
- Develops a model to estimate transaction volumes from web traffic data, avoiding extensive manual measurements.
- The PGenAI rubric finds most surveyed "non-automatable" services still have medium potential from generative AI.
- Concludes there is very significant potential to apply AI to streamline bureaucratic government transactions and improve productivity.

In summary, the paper provides a granular quantification of the automation opportunity in UK government transactions and tools to identify the most amenable areas, highlighting major potential gains in efficiency and productivity from deploying AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper measures the scale, distribution, and automation potential of 143 million complex, bureaucratic transactions conducted annually across 201 UK government services, finding high technical potential for automation that could yield major productivity gains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Providing a quantitative measurement and mapping of the scale, distribution, and dynamics of citizen-facing bureaucratic transactions across UK central government services. This includes estimating that UK central government conducts approximately 1 billion citizen-facing transactions per year across 377 services.

2) Developing a method to estimate the potential for automation of these bureaucratic transactions based on the routine versus non-routine task content of services. The paper finds that 84% of the 143 million complex, bureaucratic transactions conducted per year are highly automatable. 

3) Proposing a rubric to estimate the potential impact of generative AI on automating tasks previously thought non-automatable. The paper finds most low-automatable services have medium potential for generative AI adoption.

4) Providing a model to estimate transaction volumes based on web traffic, which could help government estimate volumes without extensive data collection. 

In summary, the paper offers a quantitative perspective on the functioning of modern bureaucracy and measures the automation potential of hundreds of government services using novel methods. This could help guide automation efforts to improve government productivity.

The paper focuses on analyzing and quantifying UK government services and transactions, estimating their automation potential using measures like the AST index and PGenAI rubric, and assessing the opportunity for AI and generative models to help automate bureaucratic, repetitive tasks to improve government productivity. Key concepts revolve around government services, transactions, decision-making processes, routine vs non-routine tasks, and the potential for emerging AI to automate and augment public sector work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper estimates that there are approximately 143 million complex, repetitive transactions conducted by the UK government each year that are candidates for automation. How robust is this estimate? What are the key sources of uncertainty and how might the true number differ?

2. The Automatability of Service Tasks (AST) index is used to quantify the automation potential of government services. How sensitive is this index to the specific way tasks are defined and categorized as routine/non-routine? Could small changes in these definitions substantially alter the automation potential estimates? 

3. When assigning tasks to services, the authors rely on manual review of service webpages and workflows. What are some of the limitations of this approach? How accurately and completely can service workflows and required tasks be captured through manual inspection?

4. The paper acknowledges that the list of 377 services analyzed is likely an underestimate of all government services. What techniques could be used to validate and improve the completeness of the service catalogue analyzed? How might missing services impact the overall automation potential estimates?

5. The Potential for Generative AI (PGenAI) rubric proposes assessing the potential for generative AI to benefit different services. How could this rubric be refined and standardized to enable more quantitative comparisons across services rather than qualitative judgements of potential?

6. When estimating missing transaction volumes, web traffic to service pages is used as a predictor. How reliable is web traffic as a proxy for service transaction volumes? When might the relationship between traffic and transactions break down?

7. The automation estimates focus only on service initiation transactions and do not consider ongoing maintenance transactions. What percentage of total transactions might these omitted ongoing transactions represent? How might including them impact overall results?

8. How was inter-rater reliability assessed when multiple raters were assigning tasks to services to generate the AST scores? Could subjectivity in these assignments substantially impact scores?

9. The paper estimates potential time savings if automation leads to even small (one minute) time savings per transaction. Is this one minute estimate reasonable or should analysis consider a wider range of potential time savings?

10. The analysis focuses solely on central government services. How might automation potential differ at other levels of government (e.g. local government) or in adjacent public services like healthcare?
