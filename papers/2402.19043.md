# [WDM: 3D Wavelet Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Medical Image   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generative modeling of high-resolution 3D medical images (e.g. CT, MRI) is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and limited GPU memory. Existing approaches use patch-wise, slice-wise or cascaded generation which can introduce artifacts and limit downstream applicability.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes WDM, a wavelet-based medical image synthesis framework. The key idea is to apply a diffusion model on the wavelet coefficients of the images instead of the images themselves. This reduces the spatial dimensions and memory requirements of the model while allowing generation of high quality 3D volumes.

The wavelet transform decomposes an image into low and high frequency components. The diffusion model is trained to predict the wavelet coefficients of real images. During sampling, it iteratively refines randomly initialized wavelet coefficients to generate synthetic ones, which are then reconstructed into 3D volumes using the inverse wavelet transform.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes WDM, a memory-efficient framework to scale 3D medical image generation using wavelet-based diffusion models
- Achieves state-of-the-art image quality (FID) and diversity (MS-SSIM) at 128^3 resolution 
- First model capable of high-quality 256^3 image generation with a single 40GB GPU
- Effectively incorporates wavelet transform for spatial dimensionality reduction without needing extra pretraining (unlike latent variable models)
- Promotes wavelet-based approaches to address memory limitations in other high-res 3D medical analysis tasks

In summary, the paper presents a simple yet effective way of applying diffusion models for efficient high-resolution 3D medical image synthesis by operating in the wavelet domain. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art generation quality and the ability to scale to 256^3 volumes with limited compute.
