# [Mobile Application for Oral Disease Detection using Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Poor oral hygiene can lead to severe health conditions like heart disease, cancer, etc. But regular dental check-ups are not followed by many people due to lack of access to dentists. So there is a need for technology to help people monitor their oral health easily.  

- Using medical images to train deep learning models for diagnosis raises privacy concerns.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a mobile application named OralH that allows people to conduct self-oral assessments using phone cameras. It detects potential oral diseases using computer vision and alerts users to take actions.

- Use federated learning to train YOLOv8 object detection model to identify oral hygiene issues while preserving privacy. Images stay on user devices, only model weights are shared with central server. 

- Design the application as a Progressive Web App for ubiquitous access across devices and seamless experience.

Main Contributions:
- Oral disease detection mobile app with self-assessment and personalized alerts.

- Comparing YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models for object detection, YOLOv8 gives better accuracy.  

- Using federated learning ensures data privacy while improving model performance over time with more user data.

- Easy access as Progressive Web App, integrated with location services to recommend nearby clinics based on detection results.

In summary, the paper proposes an oral disease detection system using federated learning to train object detection models, packaged as an easy-to-use mobile app for public oral health monitoring.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a mobile application with federated learning for privacy-preserving oral disease detection using YOLO object detection models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The development of a mobile application named OralH that leverages federated learning and object detection techniques to provide user-friendly solutions for oral disease detection and health insights. Specifically:

- The application allows users to conduct self-assessments of their oral health through mouth scans. 

- It utilizes the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify oral hygiene issues and diseases from the mouth scans. 

- A federated learning approach is used to train the YOLOv8 model on sensitive oral image data kept locally on user devices, enhancing privacy.

- Upon detecting potential issues, the app alerts users and provides details of nearby dental clinics for prompt professional care. 

- It is designed as a Progressive Web Application for ubiquitous access across devices and seamless user experience.

In summary, the main contribution is a privacy-preserving, easy-to-use mobile application for oral disease detection and health assistance based on state-of-the-art computer vision and federated learning techniques.
