# [A Comprehensive Analysis of the Effectiveness of Large Language Models   as Automatic Dialogue Evaluators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automatic dialogue evaluation remains challenging. Existing neural reference-free metrics still have poor alignment with human judgment and generalization ability.  

- Recent works show that large language models (LLMs), especially instruction-tuned variants like ChatGPT, are promising automatic evaluators. However, existing analysis is limited in scope regarding the number of models examined, evaluation methodology, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a comprehensive analysis on 30 recent LLMs as automatic dialogue evaluators, covering both turn and dialogue levels across multiple quality dimensions. 

- Enrich 12 meta-evaluation datasets with missing annotations using GPT-4 and use them to assess the multi-dimensional evaluation capability of the LLMs.

- Introduce a range of adversarial strategies to reduce response/dialogue quality and test the robustness of LLMs against these perturbations.

- Explore dimension-level and model-level ensemble techniques to improve evaluation.

Key Contributions:
- Multi-dimensional correlation analysis of 30 LLMs using 12 meta-evaluation datasets at turn and dialogue levels.

- Annotation enrichment of existing datasets and release for future benchmarking. 

- Robustness analysis of LLMs using adversarial strategies targeting different quality dimensions.

- Analysis of ensemble techniques to boost evaluation capability.

- Key observations on factors impacting LLM evaluation performance like model scale, instruction data, dimension specificity, etc.

In summary, this is a comprehensive study analyzing the effectiveness of applying recent LLMs for automatic dialogue evaluation via correlation analysis, robustness probing and ensemble techniques.
