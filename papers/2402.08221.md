# [MetaTra: Meta-Learning for Generalized Trajectory Prediction in Unseen   Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08221)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Current trajectory prediction models perform well in known environments but struggle when applied to new unseen scenarios. This is due to distribution shifts between training and test data, as well as insufficient consideration of diverse trajectory patterns across scenarios. For example, models trained predominantly on simple linear trajectories may fail on more complex trajectories involving frequent unpredictable path shifts to avoid collisions.

Proposed Solution:
1. Dual Trajectory Transformer (Dual-TT) - Contains temporal mining and interacted mining pathways to thoroughly evaluate individual intentions and group interactions influencing trajectories.

2. Meta-Learning Framework (MGTP) - Simulates transitions between source and target domains via meta-train and meta-test splits to improve generalization. Includes Serial and Parallel Training (SPT) for stability, and MetaMix for augmented diversity.

Key Contributions:
1. First application of meta-learning to address generalization in trajectory prediction. MGTP tailors meta-train/test splits and uses SPT and MetaMix to enhance stability.

2. Dual-TT model effectively assimilates assessments of individual intentions and interactive effects within group motion patterns to handle complex scenarios.  

3. Experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD and NBA datasets confirm consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods. MGTP integration markedly improves efficacy of various prediction models.

In summary, this paper introduces a meta-learning framework and dual trajectory model to improve generalization of trajectory predictors to diverse unseen environments, outperforming prior state-of-the-art techniques.
