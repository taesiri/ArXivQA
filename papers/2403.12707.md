# [Selective Domain-Invariant Feature for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12707)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing deepfake detection methods rely on learning patterns of forgery from the training data, thus performing poorly on unseen domains. 
- They fail to separate features irrelevant to forgery, limiting generalization ability.

Proposed Solution:
- A new framework called Selective Domain-Invariant Feature (SDIF) is proposed to reduce sensitivity to face forgery and improve generalization.

Key Components:
- Farthest-Point Sampling (FPS) strategy to construct a uniform style sample representation space for fusing content and style features. 
- Dynamic feature extraction module to generate features with diverse styles, improving feature extractor's performance.
- Domain separation strategy to retain domain-related features to distinguish real vs fake faces.

Main Contributions:
- FPS-based style sample sampling for discrete and uniform representations.
- Dynamic convolution module to extract adaptive features for diverse forgery methods. 
- Decoupling domain labels to reduce interference from intra-domain correlations unrelated to forgery.

Key Results:
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain evaluations across multiple datasets. 
- Ablation studies validate the individual contribution of each proposed module.
- Demonstrates improved ability to detect unknown forgery methods.

In summary, the paper proposes a selective domain-invariant feature learning approach using style fusion and domain separation to improve generalization of deepfake detection to unseen domains and forgery methods.
