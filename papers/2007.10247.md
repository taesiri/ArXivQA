# [Learning Joint Spatial-Temporal Transformations for Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10247)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop an effective video inpainting method that can fill in missing regions in video frames with spatially and temporally coherent contents?

Specifically, the paper proposes a novel deep learning model called Spatial-Temporal Transformer Networks (STTN) to address the limitations of prior video inpainting methods and improve both spatial and temporal coherence. The key ideas include:

- Formulating video inpainting as a "multi-to-multi" problem that takes multiple input frames (both neighboring and distant frames) to simultaneously complete all frames. 

- Proposing a spatial-temporal transformer module that searches for coherent contents from all input frames along both spatial and temporal dimensions using a multi-scale patch-based attention mechanism.

- Optimizing the model using both reconstruction losses and a spatial-temporal adversarial loss to ensure perceptually realistic and coherent results.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that jointly learning spatial-temporal transformations in a deep generative model optimized by spatial-temporal losses can significantly improve video inpainting performance and coherence. The proposed STTN model aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a joint Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (STTN) for video inpainting. Specifically:

- They formulate video inpainting as a "multi-to-multi" problem, taking both neighboring and distant frames as input to simultaneously fill missing regions in all frames. 

- They propose a spatial-temporal transformer module that searches for coherent contents from all input frames along both spatial and temporal dimensions using a multi-scale patch-based attention mechanism. This allows handling complex motions and appearance changes.

- They optimize the network with a spatial-temporal adversarial loss to generate perceptually pleasing and coherent results. 

- Experiments show their method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets for both stationary and moving masks. 

In summary, the key contribution is developing a spatial-temporal transformer network optimized with an adversarial loss to achieve high-quality and coherent video inpainting results by joint modeling of spatial and temporal dimensions. The multi-scale patch attention mechanism and simultaneous completion of all frames help handle complex motions and appearances.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a joint spatial-temporal transformer network (STTN) for video inpainting that uses multi-scale patch-based attention to simultaneously fill missing regions in input frames with coherent contents extracted from the whole video.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents Spatial-Temporal Transformer Networks (STTN) for video inpainting, which aims to fill in missing or occluded regions in video frames with coherent content. Here are some key ways this research compares to other work in video inpainting:

- Most prior work uses 3D convolutions or recurrent networks to aggregate information from nearby frames. This can fail to capture long-range dependencies and lead to temporal artifacts. STTN uses a transformer architecture to simultaneously attend to all input frames, capturing long-range correspondences.

- Many methods process videos frame-by-frame without explicit temporal coherence optimization. STTN proposes a spatial-temporal adversarial loss to ensure spatio-temporal consistency. 

- Some methods assume global transformations or homogeneous motion for attention-based filling. STTN uses multi-scale patch attention to handle complex motions and appearance changes.

- Previous attention-based methods often have inconsistent attention across frames/steps. STTN's joint spatial-temporal attention and multi-layer design improves attention consistency.

- Most works focus on qualitative results. This paper provides extensive quantitative evaluation and comparisons using PSNR, SSIM, flow warp error, and VFID metrics.

- Many models are slow for video tasks. STTN uses efficient patch representations for fast 24fps performance on high-res video.

Overall, this work pushes state-of-the-art in video inpainting by enabling joint consistent spatial-temporal attention, designing for spatio-temporal coherence, evaluating rigorously on benchmarks, and achieving efficient performance. The transformer architecture and adversarial training are key innovations compared to prior arts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions in the concluding section:

1. Extend the spatial-temporal transformer by using attention on 3D spatial-temporal patches to improve short-term coherence. The current model only calculates attention among spatial patches, which makes it difficult to capture short-term temporal continuity for complex motions. Using attention on 3D patches could help capture motion better.

2. Investigate other types of temporal losses for joint optimization. They plan to explore video-based perceptual and style losses computed on spatial-temporal features to leverage temporal contexts during training. 

3. Improve robustness to large missing regions. The model performance decreases on larger holes, so they want to improve robustness in the future.

4. Applications to broader video editing tasks. The spatial-temporal transformer could potentially benefit other video editing tasks beyond inpainting, such as video retargeting, stabilization, etc. Exploring these applications could be interesting future work.

In summary, the main future directions are: 1) Using 3D attention, 2) Exploring temporal losses, 3) Improving robustness, and 4) Applying to other video editing tasks. The core ideas are enhancing the model's ability to handle complex motions and leverage temporal context for better coherence.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel joint Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (STTN) for video inpainting. The key idea is to simultaneously fill missing regions in all input frames by learning coherent spatial-temporal transformations with self-attention. Specifically, the STTN consists of a frame encoder, multi-layer multi-head spatial-temporal transformers, and a frame decoder. The transformers search relevant contents from all frames by calculating attention on spatial patches across different scales, allowing it to handle complex motions. By stacking multiple transformer layers, attention results can be iteratively improved based on updated region features. The STTN is optimized end-to-end by a spatial-temporal adversarial loss to generate perceptually rational and coherent results. Experiments on standard datasets with stationary and moving masks show STTN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The superior performance verifies the benefits of joint spatial-temporal transformation learning for video inpainting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

This paper proposes a joint spatial-temporal transformer network (STTN) for high-quality video inpainting. Video inpainting aims to fill missing regions in video frames with plausible contents. Existing methods adopt attention models to complete each frame by searching contents from reference frames, but can suffer from inconsistent attention results leading to artifacts. 

The proposed STTN framework addresses these issues by simultaneously filling missing regions in all input frames using self-attention. It searches coherent contents along both spatial and temporal dimensions using a multi-scale patch-based attention module. This allows it to handle complex motions and appearance changes. A spatial-temporal adversarial loss is used to optimize STTN to generate perceptually realistic results. Experiments on benchmark datasets with stationary and moving masks show STTN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The multi-scale patch representations also enable efficient training and inference.

This paper proposes a novel Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network (STTN) for video inpainting. The key idea is to learn joint spatial and temporal transformations to fill in missing regions in video frames with coherent contents. Specifically, the STTN takes multiple input frames and fills in missing regions in all frames simultaneously using a multi-layer multi-head spatial-temporal transformer module.
