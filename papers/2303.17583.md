# [TiDy-PSFs: Computational Imaging with Time-Averaged Dynamic   Point-Spread-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether using dynamic/time-averaged point spread functions (PSFs) generated by sequences of phase masks can improve the performance of computational imaging tasks like monocular depth estimation and extended depth of field imaging compared to using a single static phase mask. 

The key hypothesis is that the set of PSFs achievable with a single static phase mask is non-convex, while time-averaged PSFs span the convex hull of this set and are thus fundamentally more expressive. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that optimizing sequences of phase masks whose time-averaged PSFs are used for imaging tasks will enable superior performance compared to optimizing a single static mask.

The paper provides a proof that the set of PSFs from a single mask is indeed non-convex. It then demonstrates through simulations that time-averaged PSFs generated by multiple phase masks optimized end-to-end can substantially improve depth estimation and extended depth of field performance compared to single mask methods from prior work.

In summary, the central research question is whether dynamic/time-averaged PSFs can improve computational imaging, with the key hypothesis being that they provide a more expressive design space due to the non-convexity of the static PSF set. The simulations and analyses in the paper aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a method to optimize multiple phase masks that can be dynamically switched over time in order to improve computational imaging performance. Specifically:

- They prove that the set of PSFs generated by a single static phase mask is non-convex. This means that time-averaged PSFs generated by sequences of dynamic phase masks can span a larger, more expressive space. 

- They propose an end-to-end learning framework to jointly optimize a sequence of phase masks along with reconstruction neural networks for tasks like monocular depth estimation and extended depth-of-field imaging.

- Through simulations, they demonstrate that their method of using multiple dynamic phase masks achieves superior performance compared to using a single static phase mask for both monocular depth estimation and extended depth-of-field imaging.

In summary, the key innovation is using sequences of dynamically switched phase masks rather than a single static mask, which provides access to a more expressive space of possible PSFs. This allows their method to optimize optical coding and algorithm reconstruction to achieve state-of-the-art results on computational imaging tasks.
