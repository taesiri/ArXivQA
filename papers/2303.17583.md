# [TiDy-PSFs: Computational Imaging with Time-Averaged Dynamic   Point-Spread-Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17583)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether using dynamic/time-averaged point spread functions (PSFs) generated by sequences of phase masks can improve the performance of computational imaging tasks like monocular depth estimation and extended depth of field imaging compared to using a single static phase mask. 

The key hypothesis is that the set of PSFs achievable with a single static phase mask is non-convex, while time-averaged PSFs span the convex hull of this set and are thus fundamentally more expressive. Therefore, the authors hypothesize that optimizing sequences of phase masks whose time-averaged PSFs are used for imaging tasks will enable superior performance compared to optimizing a single static mask.

The paper provides a proof that the set of PSFs from a single mask is indeed non-convex. It then demonstrates through simulations that time-averaged PSFs generated by multiple phase masks optimized end-to-end can substantially improve depth estimation and extended depth of field performance compared to single mask methods from prior work.

In summary, the central research question is whether dynamic/time-averaged PSFs can improve computational imaging, with the key hypothesis being that they provide a more expressive design space due to the non-convexity of the static PSF set. The simulations and analyses in the paper aim to validate this hypothesis.
