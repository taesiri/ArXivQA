# [DecentNeRFs: Decentralized Neural Radiance Fields from Crowdsourced   Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13199)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Billions of images are captured daily worldwide, but most remain siloed in personal photo galleries and contain private content users may not want to share publicly. 
- Learning neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to convert images into immersive 3D experiences at a global scale requires centralized processing which is computationally intractable.
- Existing decentralized approaches for NeRFs assume static scene content across users which does not hold for real-world crowdsourced images containing transient personal content.

Proposed Solution - DecentNeRF:
- Separates images into global scene content and personal user-specific content using personal and global MLPs trained on user devices.
- Federates only the global MLPs across users using a novel learned weighted aggregation scheme for high reconstruction quality.
- Employs secure multi-party computation during aggregation so server only accesses averaged global MLP to prevent reconstructing personal content.

Key Contributions:
- First decentralized approach to address challenges of learning photorealistic global 3D scenes from crowd-sourced images.
- Achieves high visual fidelity with ~10,000x less server compute than centralized approaches.
- Outperforms existing decentralized methods on reconstruction quality while minimizing personal content leakage.
- Enables applications like city-scale NeRFs, immersive event experiences virtually, and photo-tourism from images stored on user devices.

In summary, the key innovation is a decentralized framework to construct high quality immersive 3D experiences from crowd-sourced images while preserving user privacy. This allows scaling neural radiance fields to global levels not possible with centralized approaches.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting DecentNeRF, a decentralized framework for learning neural radiance fields (NeRFs) from crowd-sourced images. Specifically:

1) DecentNeRF decomposes each user's multi-view images into separate personal and global scene representations. This allows aggregating only the global scene representation across users to reconstruct the 3D scene, while minimizing reconstruction of personal/sensitive content at the server. 

2) DecentNeRF uses a novel learned federation scheme to aggregate users' global scene representations, outperforming standard federated averaging schemes. This results in high-quality reconstruction of the global 3D scene.

3) Through secure multi-party computation techniques, DecentNeRF ensures the server only has access to an aggregated global scene representation and not individual users' representations. This significantly reduces undesired reconstruction of personal content compared to prior decentralized approaches.

4) Evaluations on synthetic and real-world crowd-sourced datasets demonstrate DecentNeRF's advantages in terms of photorealism and privacy with orders of magnitude less server computation than centralized approaches.

In summary, DecentNeRF enables learning decentralized and privacy-preserving neural radiance fields from crowd-sourced images at a global scale.

The paper introduces "DecentNeRF", a decentralized framework to learn neural radiance fields from crowd-sourced images. It separates the personal and global content in images and uses techniques like federated learning and SMPC to aggregate only the global content across users.
