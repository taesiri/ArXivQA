# [FOFO: A Benchmark to Evaluate LLMs' Format-Following Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18667)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) do not specifically evaluate their capability of generating outputs that follow exact format requirements given by humans. However, this format-following capability is crucial for applying LLMs as AI assistants to automate workflows. 

- Current benchmarks either focus on open dialog evaluation without considering format requirements, or only have simple format tests without real-world complexity and domain diversity.

Method:
- The authors propose a new hierarchical benchmark called "FoFo" to evaluate the format-following capability of LLMs across diverse real-world domains. 

- FoFo covers 10 domains like healthcare, finance, software etc. Each domain has 5 sub-domains. For each sub-domain, domain-specific formats are curated.  

- Real-world test prompts are generated combining formats from the hierarchy. The prompts require LLMs to generate detailed domain-specific outputs following complex format requirements.

- GPT-4 is used to automatically evaluate accuracy of format adherence for LLMs.

Results:
- FoFo unveils significant gaps between open-sourced vs closed-sourced LLMs regarding format-following, even though their capabilities look similar on existing benchmarks.

- Rankings of LLMs on FoFo does not correlate with rankings on other benchmarks, suggesting format-following is an independent capability.

- Analysis shows LLMs have variability in format-following across different domains, indicating need for domain-specific tuning.  

Contributions:
- First domain-specific, real-world complexity benchmark targeting format-following for LLMs
- Unveils gaps in existing LLMs regarding format adherence crucial for real-world assistance applications
- Can guide development of specialized LLM models for workflows in different domains


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new benchmark to evaluate large language models' capability of following formats in diverse real-world domains, revealing performance gaps between open-sourced and closed-sourced models as well as discrepancy across domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and building a new format-following evaluation benchmark (FoFo) for large language models (LLMs). The key aspects of this contribution are:

1) FoFo aims to assess the capacity of LLMs to follow specific output formats, which is an important capability when employing LLMs as AI assistants but is not directly measured by existing benchmarks.

2) The benchmark covers diverse real-world domains likely to adopt LLMs as agents, with test examples reflecting complicated and domain-specific format requirements. This is achieved through a hierarchical prompt generation approach.

3) Experiments on various state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that format-following is an independent capability not captured by generic benchmarks. FoFo also reveals performance differences across domains and models.

4) Consequently, FoFo facilitates more targeted LLM selection, training and evaluation as AI assistants for different applications. It highlights format-following as a dimension for further improvement to realize the promise of LLMs as versatile AI agents.

In summary, the key contribution is conceptualizing and creating a specialized benchmark to evaluate the format-following abilities of LLMs across realistic domains, revealing new insights into this crucial but overlooked capability.
