# [Efficient Dynamic-NeRF Based Volumetric Video Coding with Rate   Distortion Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Volumetric videos can provide immersive 3D experiences but require tremendous data volumes for storage and transmission. Efficient compression of volumetric videos is crucial for their widespread adoption. Recent works have shown promise in using neural radiance fields (NeRF) for volumetric video compression thanks to their compact scene representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities. However, existing NeRF-based compression methods like ReRF have suboptimal efficiency as they separate the modeling and compression steps, and use coarse motion estimation that fails to fully eliminate inter-frame redundancy.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes an end-to-end optimized dynamic NeRF representation for efficient volumetric video coding. They decompose NeRF into coefficient fields capturing scene variations, and basis fields representing common scene attributes. For dynamics, only the coefficient and residual fields are updated over time and added to existing basis field from prior frame. This compactly represents the video while ensuring temporal continuity. Crucially, they jointly optimize modeling and compression by using differentiable simulated quantization and rate estimation losses during modeling itself. This makes the learned features robust to quantization and have low entropy, enhancing compression performance.

Main Contributions:
1) Compact dynamic NeRF video representation by incrementally updating basis, coefficient and residual fields over time while reusing prior basis field.
2) End-to-end optimization of modeling and compression by using simulated differentiable quantization and rate losses, making features quantization-robust and low-entropy.
3) State-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two datasets with BD-rate gains of 28-66% over prior arts like ReRF. Qualitative improvements in fine details like accessories and facial features.

In summary, the paper achieves significant bitrate savings compared to prior NeRF compression techniques through an end-to-end optimized dynamic representation learned with built-in compression-aware losses. This can help enable practical adoption of immersive volumetric video applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an efficient dynamic neural radiance field based volumetric video coding method through compact modeling of dynamic scenes and end-to-end optimization of modeling and compression.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. It proposes an efficient volumetric video compression method based on dynamic neural radiance fields, achieving state-of-the-art compression performance. 

2. It proposes a modeling approach to compactly represent dynamic neural radiance fields, which effectively enhances compression efficiency.

3. It devises a strategy that jointly optimizes the modeling and compression of dynamic NeRF, replacing non-differentiable quantization and entropy encoding with differentiable operations. This enables end-to-end joint optimization and enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance.

In summary, the paper makes contributions in three aspects: (1) an efficient dynamic NeRF based video compression method with state-of-the-art results; (2) a compact representation for dynamic NeRF to improve compression efficiency; and (3) an end-to-end joint optimization strategy for modeling and compressing dynamic NeRF. The key innovation is performing end-to-end optimization of the entire compression pipeline to achieve better rate-distortion trade-offs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes decomposing the neural radiance field (NeRF) representation into coefficient fields and basis fields. Can you explain in more detail how this decomposition works and the motivation behind it? 

2. The paper introduces a compact dynamic NeRF representation by only updating the coefficient fields and residual fields at each timestep. What is the intuition behind updating these specific components over time rather than updating the entire NeRF?

3. The end-to-end optimization incorporates simulated quantization and rate estimation during NeRF training. Can you explain why incorporating these non-differentiable operations is beneficial and how the rate estimation loss is calculated?

4. How exactly does the dynamic NeRF modeling build upon the DiF static scene representation? What modifications were made to extend DiF to the dynamic modeling case?

5. Why is the L1 regularization on the residual fields important? How does it encourage temporal continuity and facilitate video compression?

6. Could you analyze the rate-distortion performance gains achieved from (a) the dynamic modeling and (b) the end-to-end optimization separately? What contributes more to the gains?

7. The method stores previous frame basis fields in a decoded frame buffer. How large must this buffer be to store a long video sequence? Are there ways to limit its size?

8. Could the dynamic NeRF representation and end-to-end optimization scheme be applied effectively to other 3D video compression methods besides ReRF? Which ones?

9. What are the limitations of directly applying lossless compression algorithms like 7zip to compress dynamic NeRF representations? Why does end-to-end optimization address these?  

10. The method models videos at 20 FPS. How could the approach be extended to model and compress higher frame rate videos more efficiently? What would need to change?
