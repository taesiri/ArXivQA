# [PCoQA: Persian Conversational Question Answering Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04362)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces PCoQA, the first Persian conversational question answering dataset. PCoQA contains 870 dialogs and over 9,000 question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia documents. Compared to previous conversational QA datasets like CoQA and QuAC, PCoQA features longer answers, more open-ended non-factual questions, longer documents, and fewer lexical overlaps between questions and answers. This presents new challenges for conversational QA models. The paper details the careful process for selecting coherent Wikipedia documents and annotating dialogs. After post-processing to reduce question-answer similarity, benchmark experiments are conducted with transformer-based models like ParsBERT and XLM-Roberta. The best results are achieved by pre-training XLM-Roberta on the Persian SQuAD dataset ParSQuAD before fine-tuning on PCoQA. However, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to human responders, especially for exact match scores. Additional analysis shows the importance of modeling conversational history and turn-wise performance. Future work includes developing semi-automated methods for dataset construction and evaluating models without access to gold history answers. Overall, PCoQA facilitates new research into Persian conversational QA with its novel challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces PCoQA, the first Persian conversational question answering dataset, comprising 870 dialogs and over 9,000 contextually-driven questions based on Wikipedia documents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of PCoQA, the first Persian conversational question answering dataset. PCoQA contains 870 dialogs, 9,026 question-answer pairs, and corresponding Wikipedia documents. The paper describes the process of constructing the dataset, including document collection, annotation, post-processing, validation, analysis, and splitting. Key features of PCoQA highlighted in the paper include:

- More open-ended, non-factual questions resulting in longer answers compared to previous datasets
- Fewer lexical overlaps between questions and answers
- Longer context documents compared to other datasets 
- Higher number of questions per dialog compared to some datasets like QuAC

The paper also provides benchmark results on PCoQA using various methods, including baseline models like ParsBERT and XLM-Roberta, as well as pre-trained models leveraging other QA datasets. The effectiveness of pre-training to mitigate PCoQA's relatively small size is demonstrated.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of the first conversational QA dataset for the Persian language, PCoQA, along with benchmark results.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Persian Conversational Question Answering Dataset (PCoQA) - This is the name of the dataset introduced in the paper.

- Question answering in context - The paper focuses on conversational question answering where each question depends on the context and dialog history.

- Wikipedia documents - The documents used to build the dataset are sourced from Wikipedia.

- History modeling - Capturing the dependency between dialog turns by modeling history is an important challenge discussed. 

- Pre-training - The paper explores pre-training on other QA datasets to mitigate data scarcity issues.

- Baselines and benchmarks - Different baseline methods and benchmark results are reported for the dataset.

- Non-factual questions - The paper notes prevalence of non-factual questions leading to longer answers as a characteristic.

In summary, the key terms revolve around introduction of the conversational QA dataset, its construction process, analysis, and benchmarking experiments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions taking initiatives from both CoQA and QuAC datasets to build PCoQA. What specific initiatives were taken from each dataset and how do they manifest in PCoQA?

2. The document selection process involves a human annotator serving as a "document provider" to ensure contextual coherence. What guidelines does this role follow to determine which sections should be included or excluded? 

3. The paper states that questions exhibiting high lexical overlap with the answer sentence are rewritten. What is the threshold similarity score above which questions get flagged for rewriting? How exactly are those questions rewritten?

4. The paper introduces a new evaluation metric called HEQ-M. How is this metric calculated and what insight does it provide over the existing HEQ-D metric? 

5. Pre-training on ParSQuAD is found to be more effective than QuAC for the XLM-Roberta model. Why might this be the case considering QuAC's conversational nature?

6. The performance gap between models and human responders is largest for the EM metric. What does this suggest about the completeness of answers generated by the models?

7. How do the document lengths in PCoQA compare to CoQA and QuAC? What modeling implications does this have?

8. What role does the history play in model performance? How was the optimal history length determined and what was the basis for that choice?

9. What trends are observed in the per-turn F1 scores of models with and without conversational pre-training? What hypotheses do the authors raise to explain this?

10. The authors suggest future work in synthetic dataset construction. What benefits could this provide over the current human-annotated approach?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current conversational question answering systems lack capabilities to handle dynamic and evolving human conversations. Existing datasets also have limitations like short answers, high lexical overlap between questions and answers, and focus on factual questions.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces PCoQA - the first Persian conversational question answering dataset to address these limitations. 

- PCoQA has 870 dialogs and over 9,000 question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia documents. The dialogs involve a questioner asking inter-connected questions and a responder providing span answers from the text.

- Compared to previous datasets, PCoQA has longer answers, more abstract and non-factual questions, and fewer lexical overlaps between questions and answers.

- Baseline models like ParsBERT and XLM-Roberta as well as pre-training techniques are evaluated on the dataset. Pre-training on ParSQuAD and QuAC is shown to boost performance.

Main Contributions:
- The first conversational QA dataset for Persian - PCoQA - which enables research into context-aware QA systems.

- The dataset introduces new challenges like long, explanatory answers and more open-ended questions.

- Analysis of baseline models and pre-training techniques, which provide performance benchmarks.

- Demonstration of the effectiveness of pre-training on related QA datasets for boosting performance, especially capturing conversational dependencies.

The paper not only introduces an innovative and extensive dataset but also provides comprehensive dataset analysis along with baseline methods and results. PCoQA advances the field of conversational QA, especially for morphologically rich and low resource languages like Persian.
