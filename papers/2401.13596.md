# [PLATE: A perception-latency aware estimator,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of target tracking, where the goal is to estimate the state (e.g. position and velocity) of a target over time using visual or range sensors. A key challenge is the trade-off between the perception latency (time to process raw sensor data into target detections) and the accuracy of the detections. Using more advanced perception methods yields higher accuracy but longer latency, while faster methods have lower latency but may miss detections or produce noisy measurements. The paper argues that most works focus on finding an optimal static perception configuration that balances this trade-off. However, it may be better to adaptively change the perception method over time as the target and environment dynamics change.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Perception-LATency aware Estimator (PLATE) for optimally scheduling different perception methods to balance latency, accuracy, and computational load over time. The estimator uses a Kalman filter to track the target state. The scheduling policy uses dynamic programming to pick the best perception method for each new sensor measurement, based on the current estimator uncertainty and the expected quality/latency of each method. An approximate version quantizes the covariance matrix to limit computational complexity. PLATE also supports changing perception quality estimates online, and can be used in a moving horizon fashion by replanning the schedule periodically.

Main Contributions:
- Formal problem statement for perception scheduling in target tracking to optimize a cost function capturing latency, accuracy and computational load
- Optimal estimator structure given a schedule, based on Kalman filtering
- Exact but computationally complex optimal dynamic programming scheduler
- Computationally efficient approximate scheduler using covariance matrix quantization, with proof of arbitrary closeness to optimal
- Extension to moving horizon schedule replanning using online updated perception quality estimates
- Evaluation on simulations and real dataset using deep learning for perception, showing accuracy and efficiency improvements over baseline methods

In summary, the key innovation is an adaptive perception scheduling policy for target tracking that optimizes latency, accuracy and load over time by leveraging perception methods with differing qualities. Both theoretical properties and practical performance are demonstrated.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PLATE, a new perception-latency aware estimator for target tracking that adaptively selects different perception methods over time to optimize a cost function capturing the trade-off between perception quality, latency, and computational resource usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing PLATE (Perception-LATency aware Estimator), which is a new approach for scheduling different perception methods in target tracking applications. Specifically:

- PLATE schedules different perception configurations over time in order to optimize a performance measure that considers both perception quality and resource usage/computational load. 

- Compared to other heuristic frame-skipping techniques, PLATE provides a more principled and optimality-driven approach, equipped with theoretical guarantees.

- PLATE takes into account the effect of perception latency on the target uncertainty model, which is not considered by other related scheduling methods.

- The advantages of PLATE are verified through simulations and experiments on real data using state-of-the-art deep learning methods for perception.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of PLATE as an optimal perception-latency aware scheduler for target tracking that manages the trade-off between perception quality and resource usage.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new concept called "perception-latency". How is this defined and how does it differ from other types of latency that are typically considered in control and estimation problems? What unique challenges does managing the perception-latency pose?

2. The proposed PLATE method combines an estimation algorithm and a perception-latency scheduling policy. Explain in detail the structure and functionality of each of these components. What is the motivation behind this combined approach?

3. The paper points out that the optimal perception scheduling problem formulated leads to a combinatorial explosion. Explain why this happens and how the proposed quantized covariance approach approximately solves this problem while keeping computational complexity tractable.
