# [Efficient Title Reranker for Fast and Improved Knowledge-Intense NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Vanilla neural passage rerankers are slow when reranking a large number of passages, limiting the recall for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks.
- Training instability and accuracy drops were observed when training an efficient title reranker, caused by overconfident predictions for trivial answers and noisy labels for difficult answers. 

Proposed Solution:
- An Efficient Title Reranker (ETR) that uses a Broadcasting Query Encoder (BQE) technique to encode the query once and broadcast it to multiple titles, speeding up reranking by 20-40x.  
- A Sigmoid Trick that reduces gradient updates for both overconfident and noisy label predictions, improving training stability and performance.

Key Contributions:
- Broadcasting Query Encoder enables one-pass fast reranking of titles for a 20-40x speedup over passage rerankers.
- Sigmoid Trick stabilizes training and improves efficacy of Efficient Title Reranker.
- Achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple KILT benchmark tasks, demonstrating effectiveness of proposed techniques.
- Showed title reranking can surpass performance of systems using dense passage retrieval, with lower memory costs.

The paper introduces highly novel and effective techniques to enable fast and accurate knowledge retrieval for RAG tasks. Key results demonstrate significant improvements in speed, accuracy and training stability over prior art.
