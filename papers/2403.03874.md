# [Impoverished Language Technology: The Lack of (Social) Class in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is extensive research in linguistics showing that socioeconomic status (SES) has a significant impact on language production and perception. However, SES has been largely overlooked in NLP research. 
- Out of 78 NLP papers surveyed that mention SES, only 20 actually engage with it beyond just collecting basic demographic annotations.
- There is no standardized way of measuring or reporting SES in NLP research. Common proxies like income or occupation capture only one aspect and can be biased.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a definition of social class and SES that can be operationalized in NLP research, drawing on concepts like economic, social and cultural capital.
- Make recommendations for measuring SES in NLP based on objective factors like income and education as well as subjective self-reporting.
- Argue for the inclusion of SES as a demographic variable in NLP datasets and research to counter biases and better reflect diversity of language use.

Main Contributions:
- Document the lack of focus on SES in NLP research despite its linguistic importance.
- Survey how SES is currently measured in NLP literature and contrast it to social science methods.
- Provide concrete suggestions for measuring and reporting SES to enable further research, such as using the Macarthur scale for subjective status.
- Highlight the need for more diverse NLP data including lower SES populations.
- Outline directions for future computational sociolinguistics work on modeling the language of different socioeconomic groups.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper surveys the lack of consideration of socioeconomic status in NLP research and proposes recommendations for measuring and reporting on it in future work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper documents the lack of NLP work dealing with socio-economic status through a survey. It finds that only 20 papers in the ACL anthology mention socio-economic status, and most do not actually engage with it beyond collecting some demographic information about annotators. 

The paper also contrasts how socio-economic status is measured in the NLP literature compared to metrics used in the social sciences, finding no systematic methodology in NLP. 

Finally, the paper makes recommendations for future research regarding properly documenting and contextualizing data collection to make NLP research more equitable, as well as establishing how current metrics and models represent language varieties across different socio-economic groups.

So in summary, the main contribution is drawing attention to the research gap around socio-economic status in NLP, surveying existing limited work, and making recommendations for better documentation and measurement of socio-economic factors in future NLP research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the keywords associated with it are:

Social Class, Marginalisation, Linguistic Diversity

These keywords are listed explicitly in the abstract of the paper:

"\\ \newline \Keywords{Social Class, Marginalisation, Linguistic Diversity}"

So those would be the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper. The paper explores the relationship between socioeconomic status/social class and language usage, so those concepts are central to the paper as well. But the three keywords listed above seem to be the ones explicitly chosen by the authors to categorize the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes several recommendations for how NLP practitioners should measure and report on socio-economic status (SES) in their research. What are the main recommendations and what is the rationale behind each one?

2. The authors mention objective versus subjective ways of measuring SES. What are some examples of objective and subjective SES measures? What are the tradeoffs between these approaches? 

3. The paper argues for going beyond just income and occupation when measuring SES. What additional SES components do they suggest capturing and why? How feasible would it be to collect this information?

4. The Great British Class Survey (GBCS) is discussed as an example of using economic, social, and cultural capital to determine class. Can you explain how each type of capital is measured in the GBCS and the benefits of this approach?

5. The authors mention issues with using education level as a proxy for SES. What are some of the potential problems with relying solely on education as an SES indicator? When might it still be a useful metric?

6. For researchers using social media data, the paper suggests trying to contextualize the SES of users. What specific strategies are proposed for characterizing the socio-economic makeup of various platforms? 

7. How might the feasibility of collecting rich SES data differ between studies recruiting specialized participant samples versus large-scale social media datasets? What are the tradeoffs?

8. The paper argues SES is important for ensuring fair and equitable NLP systems. Can you elaborate on some specific ways that considering SES could help mitigate bias and unfairness issues in NLP?

9. What are some interesting research questions around the relationship between SES and language use that the authors suggest warrant future investigation? 

10. The authors recognize their recommendations focus on Western conceptions of class and SES. What are some limitations of applying these measurement schemes in other cultural contexts? How might SES be conceptualized differently in non-Western societies?
