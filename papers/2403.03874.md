# [Impoverished Language Technology: The Lack of (Social) Class in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03874)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is extensive research in linguistics showing that socioeconomic status (SES) has a significant impact on language production and perception. However, SES has been largely overlooked in NLP research. 
- Out of 78 NLP papers surveyed that mention SES, only 20 actually engage with it beyond just collecting basic demographic annotations.
- There is no standardized way of measuring or reporting SES in NLP research. Common proxies like income or occupation capture only one aspect and can be biased.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide a definition of social class and SES that can be operationalized in NLP research, drawing on concepts like economic, social and cultural capital.
- Make recommendations for measuring SES in NLP based on objective factors like income and education as well as subjective self-reporting.
- Argue for the inclusion of SES as a demographic variable in NLP datasets and research to counter biases and better reflect diversity of language use.

Main Contributions:
- Document the lack of focus on SES in NLP research despite its linguistic importance.
- Survey how SES is currently measured in NLP literature and contrast it to social science methods.
- Provide concrete suggestions for measuring and reporting SES to enable further research, such as using the Macarthur scale for subjective status.
- Highlight the need for more diverse NLP data including lower SES populations.
- Outline directions for future computational sociolinguistics work on modeling the language of different socioeconomic groups.
