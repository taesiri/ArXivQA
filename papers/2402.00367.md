# [Don't Hallucinate, Abstain: Identifying LLM Knowledge Gaps via Multi-LLM   Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 often have knowledge gaps due to the ever-evolving nature of information. When knowledge is missing, LLMs tend to hallucinate or generate biased outputs while expressing high confidence.  
- Identifying knowledge gaps in LLMs is critical for improving their reliability and trustworthiness. However, existing methods rely on problematic assumptions (e.g. LLMs can reliably evaluate their own outputs) and held-out datasets which hurt generalization.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes two new approaches called "Cooperate" and "Compete" that enable LLMs to identify their own knowledge gaps through collaboration with other LLMs.

Cooperate:
- An LLM generates an answer to a question along with confidence scores. 
- Other "expert" LLMs then provide feedback on the quality of the answer.  
- Finally, another LLM reviews all the feedback and makes an abstain/answer decision.  

Compete: 
- An LLM generates an initial answer to a question.
- Other LLMs are prompted to generate alternative conflicting answers to challenge it.  
- If the initial LLM changes its answer after seeing the alternatives, it decides to abstain.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluation and categorization of 11 existing approaches for detecting knowledge gaps in LLMs
- Proposal of two new multi-LLM collaborative approaches - Cooperate and Compete
- Extensive experiments showing Cooperate and Compete outperform other methods on 4 QA datasets and 3 LLMs, achieving 19.3% better abstain accuracy.
- Analysis showing the approaches help identify retrieval augmentation failures and knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two novel approaches, Cooperate and Compete, that enable robust language model abstention from incorrect answers by having multiple language models collaborate to reflect on generated texts and identify knowledge gaps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A critical evaluation and typology of diverse existing methods for identifying knowledge gaps in large language models (LLMs), repurposed to enable abstention functionality. The methods are categorized into calibration-based, training-based, prompting-based, and self-consistency-based approaches.

2. Two novel, robust multi-LLM collaboration methods - Cooperate and Compete - to detect LLM knowledge gaps. These allow LLMs to probe each other for knowledge gaps, either cooperatively by generating feedback or competitively by providing conflicting information. 

3. Extensive experiments demonstrating that the proposed Cooperate and Compete methods advance the state-of-the-art in abstention for question answering. On four diverse QA datasets and three LLMs, the methods achieve up to 19.3% improvements in abstain accuracy over the strongest baselines.

4. Analysis showing the proposed methods can help identify failure cases in retrieval augmentation, pinpoint knowledge gaps in multi-hop reasoning, and more. The methods are also robust to minor prompt variations.

In summary, the key contributions are a comprehensive evaluation of existing abstention methods for LLMs and two new robust multi-LLM collaboration methods that outperform prior approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Knowledge gaps - Missing or outdated information in large language models (LLMs) that the authors aim to identify and abstain from answering when present.

- AbstainQA - The problem of deciding whether an LLM should abstain from answering a question due to limitations in its knowledge. 

- Multi-LLM collaboration - Using multiple LLMs to evaluate the veracity of generated texts in cooperative or competitive settings in order to make robust abstention decisions.

- Cooperation - Having different expert LLMs generate feedback on proposed answers which is then synthesized by a judge LLM into an overall abstain decision. 

- Competition - Challenging an LLM with conflicting information from other LLMs and basing the abstain decision on whether the LLM sticks to its original answer.

- Calibration, training, prompting, and consistency methods - Different categories of existing approaches adapted by the authors to incorporate abstention functionality.

So in summary, the key terms cover knowledge gaps, abstention, multi-LLM collaboration, cooperation, competition, and adaptations of existing methods - all focused on identifying situations where LLMs should abstain due to uncertainties or limitations in their knowledge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two novel multi-LLM collaboration approaches, \textsc{Cooperate} and \textsc{Compete}. Can you explain in detail how these two approaches enable LLMs to identify their own knowledge gaps? What are the key differences between them?

2. In the \textsc{Cooperate} approach, LLMs provide feedback on each other's answers. What strategies could be used to elicit high-quality, reliable feedback from the LLMs? How can the area-chair LLM effectively aggregate potentially conflicting feedback?  

3. The \textsc{Compete} approach involves challenging an LLM with conflicting information from other LLMs. What factors determine whether the LLM will stick to its original answer or change its mind? How could this approach be improved to more precisely identify knowledge gaps?  

4. The paper demonstrates that collaboration-based approaches outperform methods relying on an individual LLM's self-evaluation. Why do you think leveraging multiple LLMs leads to better knowledge gap identification? What biases might still affect multi-LLM collaboration?

5. Aside from the four tasks evaluated in the paper, what other tasks or domains could especially benefit from using these abstention approaches to uncover knowledge gaps? What adaptations would need to be made?

6. The proposed approaches require prompting multiple LLMs, increasing computational overhead. How could efficiency be improved while retaining robust gap identification ability? Could model distillation play a role?  

7. The paper focuses on using abstention to avoid incorrect answers. Could similar collaboration strategies also improve the factuality of LLM-generated text? How so?

8. How well would these collaboration-based approaches transfer to identifying gaps related to biased, harmful, or misleading content generation instead of just factual errors? What modifications would you propose?  

9. One limitation raised is the potential gap between knowledge and generation abilities. How could the abstention approaches account for cases where knowledge exists but cannot be appropriately expressed?

10. The authors suggest ensembling precision-oriented vs. recall-oriented abstention methods. What other complementing abstention signals and strategies could contribute to an optimal ensemble?
