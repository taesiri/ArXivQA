# [Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09296)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we enable deeper graph neural networks that leverage larger receptive fields without suffering from performance deterioration like over-smoothing?

The key points are:

- Current graph neural networks like GCN suffer from performance degradation when stacking multiple layers to increase receptive field size. This has been attributed to the over-smoothing issue where node representations become indistinguishable. 

- The paper argues that the key factor contributing to this performance degradation is the entanglement of feature transformation and propagation in graph convolutions. 

- By decoupling feature transformation and propagation, the paper shows that deeper graph networks can leverage larger receptive fields without over-smoothing.

- The paper also provides theoretical analysis on very deep models that aligns with the over-smoothing issue. 

- Based on these insights, the paper proposes a Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) that can incorporate information from large, adaptive receptive fields to learn node representations.

In summary, the central research question is how to build deeper graph neural networks that can leverage larger receptive fields without suffering from issues like over-smoothing that deteriorate performance. The key hypothesis is decoupling feature transformation from propagation can achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a systematic analysis of the performance deterioration issue in deep graph neural networks, attributing it primarily to the entanglement of feature transformation and propagation in graph convolution operations. 

2. It argues that by decoupling feature transformation from propagation, deeper graph neural networks can leverage larger receptive fields without suffering from performance degradation. The over-smoothing issue only affects performance at extremely large receptive fields.

3. It gives a theoretical analysis of the above observations for very deep models, providing a rigorous description of the over-smoothing issue. 

4. Based on the analysis, it proposes a Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) that can incorporate information from large and adaptive receptive fields to learn node representations.

5. It conducts extensive experiments on citation, co-authorship and co-purchase datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed DAGNN model compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key contribution is providing new insights into building deeper graph neural networks by decoupling feature transformation and propagation, along with proposing an effective model DAGNN based on this. The analysis and experiments support these insights.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of graph neural networks:

- Focus on performance deterioration in deep graph neural networks: The paper focuses specifically on analyzing why stacking multiple layers in graph neural networks leads to performance degradation, an issue that has been observed but not deeply studied in prior work. 

- Systematic analysis of over-smoothing: The paper provides a systematic empirical and theoretical analysis of the over-smoothing phenomenon that has been hypothesized to cause performance deterioration. It argues over-smoothing alone does not fully explain the problem.

- Decoupling of representation transformation and propagation: A key insight is that entanglement of these two operations is a major factor compromising performance in deep models. The paper shows decoupling them allows building deeper models without degradation.

- Adaptive neighborhood aggregation: The proposed model incorporates an adaptive adjustment mechanism to aggregate information from different receptive fields tailored to each node. This is a novel way to leverage multi-scale structure.

- Theoretical analysis of deep models: The paper provides formal convergence analysis of common propagation schemes in infinitely deep models, giving a rigorous take on over-smoothing.

- State-of-the-art performance: Experiments demonstrate the proposed DAGNN model achieves new state-of-the-art results on several citation, co-authorship and co-purchase graphs.

Overall, the analysis and innovations around building deeper graph neural networks with adaptive neighborhood aggregation seem to be significant contributions compared to prior work focused on shallow models and analyzing over-smoothing in isolation. The paper provides both theoretical and empirical justification for its ideas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing deeper graph neural network architectures that can effectively leverage very large receptive fields without suffering from performance degradation issues like over-smoothing. The authors provide some analysis and insights into why existing graph neural networks face challenges when made deeper, but more work is needed to develop architectures that can realize the benefits of very deep models.

- Further analyzing the theoretical connection between graph topology and the convergence speed of representations during repeated propagation. The authors provide some initial analysis relating the two, but more work could elucidate the precise relationship to help guide graph neural network designs. 

- Exploring adaptive aggregation mechanisms beyond the projection-based scoring approach proposed in this work. The authors show the benefits of adaptively balancing local vs global information when aggregating features, but other adaptive schemes could be developed.

- Applying the insights and techniques from this work to other graph-based learning tasks beyond node classification, such as link prediction, community detection, etc. The analysis of deep models and adaptive feature aggregation could transfer to other graph learning problems.

- Evaluating the proposed methods on a wider range of graph datasets, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. The current experiments are limited to a few standard citation and co-purchase datasets.

- Developing more sophisticated theoretical analysis of graph neural networks, building on the initial convergence analysis provided here. A fuller understanding of deep graph model representations and how they are affected by network topology and aggregation functions is still lacking.

In summary, the key directions relate to developing deeper and more powerful graph neural network architectures, better understanding their theoretical properties, and applying the insights to a wider range of graphs and tasks. The analysis and model proposed in this paper provide a foundation for future research to build upon in these directions.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper provides a systematical analysis on the performance deterioration problem in deep graph neural networks. Many graph neural network models like graph convolutional networks suffer from performance degradation when stacking multiple layers, which prior works attribute to the over-smoothing issue. However, this paper argues that the key factor compromising performance is actually the entanglement of representation transformation and propagation in graph convolutions. The authors propose to decouple these two operations, which allows building much deeper graph neural networks that can leverage larger receptive fields without performance degradation. The over-smoothing issue is shown to affect performance only when extremely large receptive fields are utilized. Further, the authors provide a theoretical analysis that aligns with the over-smoothing issue when building extremely deep models. Based on these insights, the paper proposes an efficient and effective deep graph neural network called Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN). DAGNN decouples transformation and propagation and uses an adaptive adjustment mechanism to incorporate information from various receptive fields. Experiments on citation, co-authorship and co-purchase datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DAGNN model over previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, this paper provides new insights on the performance deterioration issue in deep graph neural networks. By decoupling transformation and propagation, much deeper graph networks can be built without performance degradation. The proposed DAGNN model achieves state-of-the-art results by adaptively gathering information from large receptive fields. The analysis and experiments support the effectiveness of the insights and proposed methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to learn node representations in graphs. The key insight is that current graph neural networks suffer from performance degradation when stacking multiple layers, which prior work attributes to over-smoothing. However, the authors argue that the main factor compromising performance is the entanglement of feature transformation and propagation in graph neural network layers. To address this, DAGNN decouples feature transformation from propagation by first using a shared MLP to transform features, followed by multiple propagation steps to aggregate neighborhood information. It then uses an adaptive adjustment mechanism with a learnable projection vector to generate retainment scores that determine how much information to retain from each propagation step. This allows DAGNN to leverage large receptive fields without performance degradation. The final node representations are generated by a weighted combination of the transformed features and propagated representations based on the retainment scores.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is performance deterioration in deep graph neural networks. Specifically:

- Many graph neural network models like graph convolutional networks rely on neighborhood aggregation/message passing to learn node representations. However, one layer of these methods only considers immediate neighbors. 

- When multiple layers are stacked to increase the receptive field, performance often degrades instead of improving. Several recent works have attributed this to an "over-smoothing" issue where node representations become overly smoothed and indistinguishable after repeated neighborhood aggregation.

- This limits the depth of graph neural networks and their ability to learn from broader network contexts. So the paper is investigating why deeper graph neural networks fail and how to address this issue.

The main questions it seems to be exploring are:

- What is the underlying cause of performance deterioration in deeper graph neural networks? Is over-smoothing the key factor?

- How can we build deeper graph neural networks that effectively leverage larger receptive fields without suffering from performance degradation?

- Can we theoretically analyze and formally describe the over-smoothing phenomenon to provide insights?

- Based on these insights, how can we design more effective deep graph neural network architectures?

So in summary, the key focus is analyzing and addressing performance deterioration in deep graph neural networks to enable deeper, more effective models. The paper aims to provide new insights on this problem and propose solutions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep graph neural network model called Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) that can learn node representations from large and adaptive receptive fields. The key insights are: (1) Decoupling representation transformation from propagation enables building much deeper GNN models that can leverage larger receptive fields without suffering from performance degradation. (2) An adaptive adjustment mechanism is proposed that can balance information from neighborhoods of different hops for each node, leading to more discriminative node representations. First, the paper provides empirical analysis on current graph convolutions (e.g. GCN) that shows performance deteriorates when stacking multiple layers due to the entanglement of transformation and propagation. After decoupling these two operations, deeper models are demonstrated to incorporate larger receptive fields without accuracy drops. Further, a theoretical analysis is provided for very deep models that aligns with the over-smoothing issue. Based on these insights, DAGNN is proposed that transforms node features with MLP, propagates representations to capture multi-hop neighborhood information, and utilizes learnable projection scores to adaptively combine representations from various receptive fields. Extensive experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that DAGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance and shows more significant advantages when training samples are limited.

This paper proposes a Deep Adaptive Graph Neural Network (DAGNN) to learn node representations in graphs while avoiding the over-smoothing issue faced by prior graph neural networks. The key ideas are: 1) decoupling feature transformation from propagation so that large receptive fields can be leveraged without performance degradation, and 2) incorporating an adaptive adjustment mechanism to balance local and global neighborhood information for each node. The authors provide empirical analysis showing that entanglement of transformation and propagation causes performance drops in deep GNNs, and theoretical analysis proving node representations become indistinguishable at extreme depths. Based on these insights, DAGNN first transforms features with an MLP, then conducts multi-hop propagation to gather neighborhood information, and finally utilizes learnable retainment scores to adaptively select suitable receptive fields for each node. Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate DAGNN's superiority over strong baselines, especially when training data is limited. The model provides an effective way to learn from large receptive fields while preventing over-smoothing.
