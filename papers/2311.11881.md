# [A New Angle: On Evolving Rotation Symmetric Boolean Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11881)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores using evolutionary algorithms to construct rotation symmetric Boolean functions, which are Boolean functions invariant under cyclic shifts of the input coordinates. While this class is much smaller than general Boolean functions, the authors did not find the search problem simpler, obtaining comparable results between rotation symmetric and general functions evolved with genetic programming. They consider constructing both bent (maximally nonlinear) and balanced highly nonlinear rotation symmetric Boolean functions. Three encodings are analyzed - bitstring, floating point, and tree-based genetic programming. Surprisingly, bitstring and floating point encodings work better than the tree encoding, differing from findings on general Boolean functions where tree encoding excels. The authors obtain competitive results rivaling custom heuristics from prior works, questioning the need to develop specialized heuristics. They achieve the best previous nonlinearities for rotation symmetric Boolean functions up to 12 variables. As the problem remains challenging for higher dimensions, they suggest exploring constructive approaches, as well as considering vectorial rotation symmetric functions, which are more relevant in applications like cryptography.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the use of generic evolutionary algorithms to evolve rotation symmetric Boolean functions, showing that they can achieve competitive results compared to customized heuristics from prior work while also observing that bitstring and floating point encodings outperform tree encoding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores using evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and differential evolution to construct rotation symmetric Boolean functions, which are Boolean functions that are invariant under cyclic shifts of the input coordinates. The authors test different encodings like bitstrings, trees, and floating point vectors to represent candidate solutions. They aim to evolve balanced highly nonlinear functions as well as bent functions. The results show that while the search space is smaller for rotation symmetric Boolean functions compared to general Boolean functions, evolving them is not necessarily easier, with genetic programming for general Boolean functions finding equally good or better functions. Interestingly, bitstring and floating point encodings work better than tree genetic programming, likely because they restrict the search space more effectively. The evolved rotation symmetric Boolean functions are competitive with or better than those from prior works using customized heuristics, questioning the need to develop specialized heuristics. Key challenges remain in scaling to larger Boolean functions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores using generic evolutionary algorithms to evolve rotation symmetric Boolean functions and finds they can achieve competitive results compared to prior works relying on customized heuristics, however constructing these functions does not appear simpler than general Boolean functions despite the smaller search space.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How difficult is it to evolve rotation symmetric Boolean functions compared to general Boolean functions using evolutionary algorithms? More specifically, the paper examines whether the smaller search space of rotation symmetric Boolean functions makes them easier to evolve than general Boolean functions with properties like high nonlinearity and balancedness.

The paper tests this by applying various evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and differential evolution to the problem of evolving rotation symmetric Boolean functions. It compares the performance to evolving general Boolean functions. The results show that evolving rotation symmetric Boolean functions is not necessarily easier despite the smaller search space. The paper also finds that tree encodings, which work the best for general Boolean functions, do not work as well for rotation symmetric ones compared to bitstring and floating point encodings.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the smaller search space of rotation symmetric Boolean functions will make them easier to evolve. The experiments then test this hypothesis by comparing the evolvability of rotation symmetric vs general Boolean functions using different evolutionary algorithms and encodings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors investigate how various evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, and algorithms for continuous optimization, can be used to construct rotation symmetric Boolean functions, including bent and balanced highly nonlinear functions.

2) They consider three different encodings for representing the Boolean functions - bitstring, tree, and floating point. The tree encoding with genetic programming and the floating point encoding are novel approaches for this problem that have not been explored before. 

3) Despite using generic metaheuristic algorithms instead of specialized, custom-designed heuristics from prior works, the authors obtain competitive results. For some cases, their results match or improve upon the best known nonlinearities.

4) They find that, contrary to constructions of general Boolean functions where tree encoding works best, bitstring and floating point encodings perform better for rotation symmetric Boolean functions. This is likely because the search space reduction with those encodings is more significant.

5) To the authors' knowledge, they are the first to apply evolutionary algorithms to construct bent rotation symmetric Boolean functions.

In summary, the main contribution is using various evolutionary algorithms and encodings to effectively construct different types of rotation symmetric Boolean functions, providing results that are competitive with prior works based on customized heuristics. The authors also identify the best encodings for this problem.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper compares to other research in the field of evolving rotation symmetric Boolean functions in several key ways:

1. It shows that while the search space for rotation symmetric Boolean functions is much smaller than for general Boolean functions, constructing them using evolutionary algorithms is not necessarily easier. The results obtained are comparable or only slightly better than those for general Boolean functions.

2. It finds that bitstring and floating point encodings perform better than tree-based genetic programming for this problem, unlike the case with general Boolean functions where tree encodings are usually superior. The authors attribute this to the more significant search space reduction with the bitstring and floating point encodings.

3. Despite using only generic evolutionary algorithms, this work achieves results competitive with or even better than related works that rely on customized heuristics tailored specifically for this problem. This raises questions about whether developing specialized heuristics is worthwhile. 

4. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to apply evolutionary algorithms to construct bent rotation symmetric Boolean functions. It also explores novel encodings like the tree and floating point representations, not previously investigated for this problem.

5. For balanced rotation symmetric functions, the results match or exceed the previous best known ones for $n=8$ and $n=9$ variables. For bent functions, they match the best known for $n=8$ only.

In summary, while not achieving significantly superior results, this work provides new insights into encoding schemes and the difficulty of this problem using different optimization approaches compared to the broader field. The competitiveness obtained using general algorithms also contrasts with the need for specialized heuristics that other studies rely on.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest two main future research directions:

1. Investigating whether constructions of (bent) rotation symmetric Boolean functions could be evolved following the approach from a prior work where genetic programming was used to evolve algebraic constructions for bent Boolean functions. The authors suggest this could help circumvent the difficulty of evolving larger rotation symmetric Boolean functions directly. 

2. Considering vectorial rotation symmetric functions (rotation symmetric S-boxes) instead of just rotation symmetric Boolean functions. The authors state this would be highly relevant from a practical perspective.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper for evolving rotation symmetric Boolean functions:

1. The paper mentions that tree encoding is usually considered the best approach for evolving general Boolean functions. However, for rotation symmetric Boolean functions, bitstring and floating point encodings performed better. Why do you think this is the case? What are the key differences when evolving rotation symmetric vs general Boolean functions?

2. The paper argues that developing custom heuristics may not be worthwhile compared to using more powerful fitness functions with generic metaheuristics. Do you agree with this assessment? Under what conditions might developing custom heuristics still provide an advantage?

3. The paper uses a two-stage fitness function for balanced, highly nonlinear functions. What is the motivation behind using a two-stage approach? How sensitive are the results to the exact formulation of the balancedness penalty term?

4. For the floating point encoding, the number of bits represented by each floating point value (the decode parameter) impacted performance. What is the tradeoff in setting this parameter and why does a small value work better? 

5. Bent rotation symmetric Boolean functions are much rarer than bent functions in general. Why then does the paper find evolving bent rotation symmetric functions easier than bent functions for 14 and 16 variables? What causes this reversal?

6. The genetic programming approach performs worse than bitstring/floating point encodings. Is it possible to modify or enhance the GP approach specifically for rotation symmetric Boolean functions? What ideas might improve performance?

7. None of the tested methods could find bent rotation symmetric Boolean functions except for 8 variables. What modifications could help obtain bent functions for larger sizes? Are there ways to inject bent function knowledge into the search?

8. The paper benchmarks against custom heuristics from prior works. What are the key algorithmic insights that likely account for the good performance of these custom methods?

9. What otherBoolean function subclasses, besides rotation symmetric, might be good targets for reducing the search space? What properties would make a subclass amenable to more efficient search?

10. The paper focuses on cryptographic properties like balancedness, nonlinearity, and bentness. What other criteria or fitness objectives would be relevant to consider when evolving rotation symmetric Boolean functions?
