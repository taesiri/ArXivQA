# [Semi-Supervised Health Index Monitoring with Feature Generation and   Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02867)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a semi-supervised approach for health index (HI) estimation that leverages Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection (DeepSAD). Rather than directly using the DeepSAD output as the HI, the authors treat the embedding as condition indicators that capture different aspects of system wear. To address limitations of the DeepSAD embedding, including low diversity of trajectories, they incorporate a novel diversity regularization loss. The enriched embeddings are integrated into a health index using an Alternating Projection Algorithm with Isotonic Constraints (APAIC). This projects the features onto the space of ideal normalized HIs with monotonic increase. Experiments on the PHME 2010 milling dataset validate the ability to produce meaningful HIs correlating to ground truth wear measures without reliance on these labels for training. Application to monitoring thermal spray coating quality using voltage signals demonstrates consistent HI increase towards expert-identified end-of-life. The semi-supervised approach enables accessible and reliable HI estimation when obtaining direct health measures is infeasible. Key innovations include diversity regularization for DeepSAD embeddings and APAIC merging for normalized, monotonic HI construction.
