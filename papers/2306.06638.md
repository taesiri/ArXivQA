# [Face0: Instantaneously Conditioning a Text-to-Image Model on a Face](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we instantaneously condition a text-to-image generation model on a face image during inference, without requiring per-instance optimization like fine-tuning or inversions?The key hypothesis appears to be:By augmenting the training data with face embeddings and training the model to also condition on these embeddings, we can equip the model with the capability to generate images conditioned on a face image at test time, just by calculating the embedding of the input face and providing it to the model along with the text prompt.In particular, the authors propose a method called Face0 that projects face embeddings into the text embedding space and trains the model to take both text and projected face embeddings as input. At test time, Face0 only requires computing the embedding of the input face image and using it in place of a few tokens in the text embedding. This allows instant face conditioning without any per-instance optimization.So in summary, the central research question is how to add facial conditioning to text-to-image models efficiently during inference. And the key hypothesis is that augmenting the training data and dual conditioning will allow this, as embodied in the proposed Face0 method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting Face0, a novel method for instantaneously conditioning an image generation model on a face image. The key ideas are:- Augmenting a dataset of annotated images with embeddings of the faces in those images. - Training an image generation model (Stable Diffusion) on this augmented dataset to be conditioned on both text and the face embeddings. - At inference time, extracting a face embedding from a user-supplied image and using it to condition image generation along with a text prompt.The benefits of Face0 highlighted in the paper are:- It allows generating images in the likeness of a person from a single photo in just seconds, without needing optimization or fine-tuning at inference time.- It enables control over generated faces via both text prompts and direct manipulation of the face embedding vectors.- It can help generate consistent characters across images by using fixed face embeddings. - It decouples some of the textual and facial biases in the model, which could help mitigate biases.- It achieves strong qualitative and quantitative results while being simple and efficient compared to existing personalization techniques.So in summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel way to instantly condition an image generation model on a face that is fast, flexible, and shows promising results. The simplicity and efficiency of Face0 compared to existing personalization methods is a key advantage.
