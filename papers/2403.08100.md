# [Efficient Language Model Architectures for Differentially Private   Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) trains models on decentralized data located on devices without sharing the data. It has applications like training language models.  
- In FL, SGD is commonly used as the client optimizer due to its efficiency. However, for language models, adaptive optimizers like Adam are preferred centralizedly for better performance.
- So the paper asks: can we modify language models to work well with SGD in FL, getting the benefits of both?

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using scale invariant architectures that are robust to changes in parameter scale during training. 
- For LSTM models, they propose a novel Coupled Input Forget Gate (CIFG) LSTM called SI-CIFG with modified sigmoid and tanh activations to make them scale invariant.
- They also use an existing scale invariant Transformer with modified attention. 
- These models can converge faster with SGD and achieve better performance in FL.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes SI-CIFG, a novel scale invariant LSTM architecture optimized for FL.
- Shows SI-CIFG outperforms standard CIFG significantly in large-scale simulation and production FL experiments.
- Applies existing scale invariant Transformer to FL and shows benefits over standard Transformer.
- Shows the proposed architectures also help when training with differential privacy in FL.
- Demonstrates language models can be optimized for effective SGD training, getting benefits of efficiency without losing adaptive optimizer performance.

In summary, the paper proposes innovative scale invariant architectures that can train language models effectively in FL using SGD, with gains in convergence speed, stability, and performance over standard architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel scale invariant recurrent architecture for federated learning of language models that accelerates convergence and improves performance compared to standard architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a novel scale invariant Coupled Input Forget Gate (CIFG) recurrent network called SI-CIFG for federated learning of language models. This is done by modifying the sigmoid and tanh activations in the CIFG cell to be scale invariant.

2) Showing that both the proposed SI-CIFG model and the existing scale invariant Transformer model perform significantly better than their standard counterparts in large-scale federated learning experiments, in terms of faster convergence and improved final model quality.

3) Demonstrating that the proposed scale invariant architectures are also compatible with and improve performance of differentially private federated learning. In particular, the scale invariant CIFG model achieves better utility under the same privacy budget compared to the standard CIFG model.

4) The results suggest that language models can be efficiently trained with simple SGD optimizers in federated learning by using these scale invariant architectures, allowing the best of both worlds - improved model quality with computation and memory efficient training.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed scale invariant CIFG model (SI-CIFG) uses max normalization after ReLU in place of the sigmoid function. What is the intuition behind using max normalization here? Does it provide any benefits over just using ReLU?

2. For the tanh function, SI-CIFG uses max normalization directly on the pre-activation features. What is the motivation behind this compared to using ReLU + max normalization? Have the authors experimented with both?

3. The scale invariant attention mechanism in Transformers uses row-wise normalization after ReLU on the attention logits. Have the authors experimented with other types of normalization here, such as max normalization? If so, how did they compare?

4. The authors claim improved training stability of SI-CIFG compared to standard CIFG when using SGD. Do they have any empirical evidence or analysis into why this is the case? Is it related to the scale invariant activations? 

5. The improved results are shown mainly on simulation and production keyboard datasets. Have the authors validated the effectiveness of SI architectures on other NLP tasks and datasets? Do the improvements still hold?

6. For the DP experiments, only CIFG models were evaluated. Would the authors expect similar improvements by making Transformers scale invariant in the DP setting as well?

7. The scale invariant functions help when using SGD/DP-FTRL optimizers. Do they provide any benefit when using adaptive optimizers like Adam instead?

8. The scale invariant modifications change the activations functions and input-output mappings of models. Does this affect representational capacity of models? Is accuracy on very large datasets impacted?  

9. The proposed changes are simple and modular. Has there been any analysis into why existing adaptive methods like Adam don't work as well in the federated setting the scale invariant models aim to improve?

10. Are there any other neural architecture modifications the authors think could improve optimization and stability when training with non-adaptive methods in federated learning?
