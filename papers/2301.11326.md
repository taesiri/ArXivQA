# [Unsupervised Volumetric Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11326)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a method for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects from monocular videos, without relying on any explicit 3D supervision or prior knowledge about the object class?

The key hypotheses underlying their approach appear to be:

1) Non-rigid deformable objects like faces and bodies can be modeled as a composition of rigid moving parts. 

2) The motion of these parts can be estimated by defining canonical 3D keypoints and predicting their 2D projections using the inherent 2D bias of convolutional neural networks.

3) The corresponding 3D pose of each part can then be recovered using a differentiable Perspective-n-Point formulation.

4) Volumetric representations like voxel grids allow modeling both the geometry and appearance of objects in a canonical frame.

5) By learning to reconstruct objects from videos using only photometric losses, the model can discover the underlying 3D structure and decompose objects into semantically meaningful constituent parts.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining these key ideas - voxel grids, rigid part-based modeling, differentiable PnP, and reconstruction losses - it is possible to learn to animate objects in 3D in a completely unsupervised way from monocular videos. The experiments and results then aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel approach for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects from monocular video. 

- Introducing a 3D autodecoder framework with a keypoint estimator using differentiable PnP to learn underlying 3D geometry and part decompositions without explicit supervision.

- Enabling the model to perform 3D segmentation, 3D keypoint estimation, novel view synthesis, and animation in an unsupervised manner.

- Demonstrating the approach on video datasets of faces (VoxCeleb) and bodies (TEDXPeople), as well as showing it can learn compelling 3D geometry just from images (Cats dataset).

- Introducing evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing unsupervised 3D animation quality on datasets without multi-view ground truth data.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposed unsupervised volumetric animation framework and its ability to learn 3D representations suitable for animation, segmentation, and novel view synthesis without ground truth 3D or camera pose data. The experiments demonstrate this on diverse objects and the introduced metrics provide means to evaluate such unsupervised 3D animation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects by learning the 3D structure and dynamics from monocular RGB videos, enabling decomposition into semantically meaningful parts that can be tracked and animated to perform 3D animation and novel view synthesis simultaneously.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach for 3D animation of non-rigid objects from monocular videos. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:

- Most prior work on unsupervised image/video animation has focused on 2D representations and transformations. This work is novel in exploring unsupervised 3D animation, which is more challenging as it requires learning 3D structure and dynamics from 2D observations. 

- For supervised 3D animation, methods typically require strong supervision like 3D models or multi-view data. This work only uses monocular video for training.

- Recent unsupervised 3D reconstruction methods from video can reconstruct deformable objects, but do not model dynamics for animation. This work learns a model that enables both reconstruction and animation.

- For unsupervised discovery of object parts for animation, prior 2D approaches use motion cues. This is harder in 3D. This work uses an approach with 3D canonical keypoints and differentiable PnP for part pose estimation.

- Many recent 3D-aware generative models require known camera poses. A key contribution here is unsupervised learning of geometry and parts without any camera supervision.

- The two-stage training strategy, starting with geometry learning and progressively adding parts, is designed to simplify optimization for this challenging unsupervised 3D learning problem.

- While focused on animation, the framework also enables unsupervised learning of 3D structure like segmentation and depth/normals for novel objects.

Overall, this work pushes the boundaries of unsupervised learning for 3D animation. The comparisons show how it addresses limitations of prior 2D and 3D approaches through unique techniques like differentiable PnP pose estimation and progressive part discovery. The results demonstrate unsupervised volumetric animation for faces and bodies for the first time.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the approach to allow for unsupervised animation and combination of multiple instances of different object categories in complex 3D scenes. The current method focuses on animating a single non-rigid deformable object, but the authors suggest exploring how to extend it to simultaneously animate and combine multiple objects. 

- Exploring ways to control fine-grained shape and appearance details, like facial expressions. The current method learns a coarse 3D structure and semantics, but finer-grained control over shape could enable more capabilities.

- Adding capabilities for relighting synthesized objects and composing them into novel environments and scenes. The current method focuses primarily on geometry and animation, but controlling lighting effects would make the synthesized animations more adaptable.

- Improving efficiency to enable higher-resolution synthesis. The current voxel-based approach limits resolution, so exploring more efficient volumetric representations could help increase synthesis quality.

- Evaluating robustness over more varied object categories and motions. The current evaluations focus on faces and bodies with somewhat constrained motions, but testing on more object types and complex motions could reveal areas for improvement.

- Expanding the approach to support few-shot inference from just a single or a few images of a novel object/person. The current method trains on videos but the authors suggest exploring inference from limited data.

In summary, the key futures directions are: scaling to more complex scenes, finer control over shape/appearance, relighting capabilities, efficiency for higher resolutions, broader evaluations, and few-shot inference. The authors lay out an ambitious roadmap for taking the initial method even further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects. The method learns the 3D structure and dynamics of objects solely from single-view RGB videos, and can decompose them into semantically meaningful parts that can be tracked and animated. Using a 3D autodecoder framework paired with a keypoint estimator via a differentiable PnP algorithm, the model learns the underlying object geometry and parts decomposition in a completely unsupervised manner. This allows it to perform 3D segmentation, 3D keypoint estimation, novel view synthesis, and animation. The framework is primarily evaluated on two video datasets - VoxCeleb and TEDXPeople. It shows it can even learn compelling 3D geometry from still images of cat faces in the Cats dataset. The method can obtain animatable 3D objects from just a single image or a few images. Overall, this is the first work to explore unsupervised image animation in 3D, which is more challenging than classical 2D animation. The proposed method addresses the challenges through its use of a 3D autodecoder, unsupervised pose estimation via differentiable PnP, and a two-stage training strategy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects. The method learns the 3D structure and dynamics of objects solely from single-view RGB videos, and can decompose them into semantically meaningful parts that can be tracked and animated. The core of the approach is a 3D autodecoder framework, paired with a keypoint estimator via a differentiable PnP algorithm. This allows the model to learn the underlying object geometry and parts decomposition in a completely unsupervised manner. The framework represents objects with a canonical voxel grid containing volumetric density and appearance features. To enable non-rigid deformations, the object is divided into rigid parts with associated 3D keypoints, which are projected to 2D via the camera model and PnP algorithm to estimate the part poses. The canonical voxel grid is then deformed using the estimated poses and a volumetric skinning procedure to obtain the target pose, which is rendered using volumetric rendering.

The method is evaluated on image and video datasets of faces and bodies. It demonstrates the ability to learn meaningful 3D geometry from images without any pose or geometry supervision. It also shows compelling results for 3D animation and simultaneous novel view synthesis on videos, enabled by the unsupervised discovery of object parts. The work introduces metrics to quantify animation and view synthesis quality when only monocular data is available for training and testing. Compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised 2D animation methods, it better preserves 3D effects like novel views, shape, and occlusion. The unsupervised nature of the approach means it can be applied to diverse objects without category-specific supervision. Limitations include resolution and voxel grid size constraints. Overall, the work presents an important advance in unsupervised animation by tackling it in 3D.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an unsupervised approach for 3D animation of non-rigid objects from monocular videos. The key ideas are:

1. The object is represented with a voxel grid containing density, appearance, and part assignment volumes. 

2. The object is decomposed into rigid parts that can move independently. The pose of each part is estimated using a 2D keypoint detector and differentiable PnP algorithm to lift 2D keypoints into 3D. 

3. Volumetric skinning is used to deform the canonical voxel grid into the target pose based on predicted part transformations. The deformed volume is rendered using volumetric rendering.

4. A two-stage training strategy is used. First, a single part is trained to learn the overall geometry. Then multiple parts are introduced to enable non-rigid animation while preserving the learned geometry.

5. The method is trained with reconstruction loss on RGB videos only, without any supervision on geometry, parts, or camera pose. Experiments show it can learn meaningful geometry and discover semantic parts like eyes, mouth, etc. in an unsupervised manner. The resulting model supports animation, novel view synthesis, and editing applications.

In summary, the key contribution is an unsupervised approach to learn a voxel-based articulated 3D representation from monocular RGB video, which enables controllable animation and synthesis while discovering the object's structure. The use of 2D keypoints and differentiable PnP connects 2D observations to the 3D representation.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

1. How to learn the 3D structure and dynamics of deformable objects like faces and bodies from monocular (single view) 2D videos, without any 3D supervision or ground truth data. 

2. How to decompose the objects into semantically meaningful parts that can be tracked and animated in 3D.

3. How to perform 3D animation of objects under novel views, going beyond traditional 2D image/video animation methods that are limited to the original viewpoint.
