# [Unsupervised Volumetric Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11326)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a method for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects from monocular videos, without relying on any explicit 3D supervision or prior knowledge about the object class?

The key hypotheses underlying their approach appear to be:

1) Non-rigid deformable objects like faces and bodies can be modeled as a composition of rigid moving parts. 

2) The motion of these parts can be estimated by defining canonical 3D keypoints and predicting their 2D projections using the inherent 2D bias of convolutional neural networks.

3) The corresponding 3D pose of each part can then be recovered using a differentiable Perspective-n-Point formulation.

4) Volumetric representations like voxel grids allow modeling both the geometry and appearance of objects in a canonical frame.

5) By learning to reconstruct objects from videos using only photometric losses, the model can discover the underlying 3D structure and decompose objects into semantically meaningful constituent parts.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining these key ideas - voxel grids, rigid part-based modeling, differentiable PnP, and reconstruction losses - it is possible to learn to animate objects in 3D in a completely unsupervised way from monocular videos. The experiments and results then aim to validate this hypothesis.
