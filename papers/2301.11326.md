# [Unsupervised Volumetric Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11326)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a method for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects from monocular videos, without relying on any explicit 3D supervision or prior knowledge about the object class?

The key hypotheses underlying their approach appear to be:

1) Non-rigid deformable objects like faces and bodies can be modeled as a composition of rigid moving parts. 

2) The motion of these parts can be estimated by defining canonical 3D keypoints and predicting their 2D projections using the inherent 2D bias of convolutional neural networks.

3) The corresponding 3D pose of each part can then be recovered using a differentiable Perspective-n-Point formulation.

4) Volumetric representations like voxel grids allow modeling both the geometry and appearance of objects in a canonical frame.

5) By learning to reconstruct objects from videos using only photometric losses, the model can discover the underlying 3D structure and decompose objects into semantically meaningful constituent parts.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining these key ideas - voxel grids, rigid part-based modeling, differentiable PnP, and reconstruction losses - it is possible to learn to animate objects in 3D in a completely unsupervised way from monocular videos. The experiments and results then aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a novel approach for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects from monocular video. 

- Introducing a 3D autodecoder framework with a keypoint estimator using differentiable PnP to learn underlying 3D geometry and part decompositions without explicit supervision.

- Enabling the model to perform 3D segmentation, 3D keypoint estimation, novel view synthesis, and animation in an unsupervised manner.

- Demonstrating the approach on video datasets of faces (VoxCeleb) and bodies (TEDXPeople), as well as showing it can learn compelling 3D geometry just from images (Cats dataset).

- Introducing evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing unsupervised 3D animation quality on datasets without multi-view ground truth data.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposed unsupervised volumetric animation framework and its ability to learn 3D representations suitable for animation, segmentation, and novel view synthesis without ground truth 3D or camera pose data. The experiments demonstrate this on diverse objects and the introduced metrics provide means to evaluate such unsupervised 3D animation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised 3D animation of non-rigid deformable objects by learning the 3D structure and dynamics from monocular RGB videos, enabling decomposition into semantically meaningful parts that can be tracked and animated to perform 3D animation and novel view synthesis simultaneously.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach for 3D animation of non-rigid objects from monocular videos. Here are some key comparisons to other related work:

- Most prior work on unsupervised image/video animation has focused on 2D representations and transformations. This work is novel in exploring unsupervised 3D animation, which is more challenging as it requires learning 3D structure and dynamics from 2D observations. 

- For supervised 3D animation, methods typically require strong supervision like 3D models or multi-view data. This work only uses monocular video for training.

- Recent unsupervised 3D reconstruction methods from video can reconstruct deformable objects, but do not model dynamics for animation. This work learns a model that enables both reconstruction and animation.

- For unsupervised discovery of object parts for animation, prior 2D approaches use motion cues. This is harder in 3D. This work uses an approach with 3D canonical keypoints and differentiable PnP for part pose estimation.

- Many recent 3D-aware generative models require known camera poses. A key contribution here is unsupervised learning of geometry and parts without any camera supervision.

- The two-stage training strategy, starting with geometry learning and progressively adding parts, is designed to simplify optimization for this challenging unsupervised 3D learning problem.

- While focused on animation, the framework also enables unsupervised learning of 3D structure like segmentation and depth/normals for novel objects.

Overall, this work pushes the boundaries of unsupervised learning for 3D animation. The comparisons show how it addresses limitations of prior 2D and 3D approaches through unique techniques like differentiable PnP pose estimation and progressive part discovery. The results demonstrate unsupervised volumetric animation for faces and bodies for the first time.
