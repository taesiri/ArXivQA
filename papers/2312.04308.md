# [Multi Actor-Critic DDPG for Robot Action Space Decomposition: A   Framework to Control Large 3D Deformation of Soft Linear Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04308)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents MultiAC6, a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to achieve large 3D deformations of deformable linear objects (DLOs) using a robot with a single arm and gripper. The framework decomposes the action space between two agents: one controlling gripper position (Agent_p) and the other controlling orientation (Agent_o). This decomposition allows efficient exploration and simplifies the manipulation task. Through extensive experiments in simulation and in the real world, MultiAC6 demonstrates strong generalization and robustness, successfully manipulating a variety of DLOs spanning different lengths, materials, and stiffnesses without needing retraining or fine-tuning. Key results show that MultiAC6 achieves higher success rates (over 66%) and larger deformations (exceeding 40cm) compared to several baseline approaches. In summary, MultiAC6 makes notable progress in real-world DRL for robotic manipulation of DLOs by enabling large, accurate 3D deformations for a variety of objects via action space decomposition.
