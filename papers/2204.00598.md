# Socratic Models: Composing Zero-Shot Multimodal Reasoning with Language

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can multiple large pretrained "foundation" models be composed in a zero-shot manner, without additional training or finetuning, to create multimodal AI systems that leverage the complementary strengths of each model?The key ideas and hypotheses proposed are:- Large pretrained models (e.g. BERT, GPT-3, CLIP) exhibit distinct capabilities that depend on the domain of data they are trained on. For example, visual-language models are trained on image captions while language models are trained on large text corpora.- These models encode different forms of commonsense knowledge across domains that are complementary. - Rather than scaling up multimodal training data or unifying model architectures, these complementary capabilities can be leveraged through "Socratic Models" - a modular framework to compose models via language-based prompting without additional training.- New multimodal tasks can be formulated as guided discussions between models (e.g. VLM, LM, ALM) to exchange information and make joint predictions through language prompts.- This allows creating systems that combine capabilities across modalities (vision, language, audio) in a zero-shot manner for tasks like image/video captioning, video QA, robot planning etc.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that heterogeneous pretrained models can be composed zero-shot via language prompting to create multimodal systems, by having the models exchange knowledge through structured dialogue without additional training. The paper demonstrates this through the proposed Socratic Models framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:1. Proposing the Socratic Models (SMs) framework, which composes multiple large pretrained models through language-based discussions (prompting) without requiring additional training. This provides a new way to build multimodal AI systems by combining complementary pretrained models in a zero-shot manner.  2. Introducing key components of SMs such as multimodal prompting methods and the concept of a language-based "world state history" for video understanding.3. Demonstrating strong quantitative performance of example SM systems on benchmarks like image captioning, video-to-text retrieval, and contextual image captioning/description. The systems match or exceed prior state-of-the-art in several zero-shot settings.4. Providing additional application examples of SMs on tasks like open-ended egocentric video question answering, multimodal dialogue assistants, and robot perception and planning. This showcases the flexibility of the framework.5. Discussing perspectives on building modular and interpretable AI systems from heterogeneous pretrained models, without requiring additional training or finetuning.In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing and demonstrating the SMs framework for composing complementary pretrained models through language-based discussions, enabling new multimodal capabilities without model finetuning or training data. The paper showcases strong quantitative and qualitative results across diverse applications.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces Socratic Models, a new framework for combining multiple pretrained language models to perform multimodal reasoning tasks without requiring additional training or finetuning. Here are some key ways this work compares to other related research:- Leverages complementary knowledge in different foundation models. Many prior works focus on scaling up training data and model sizes within a single modality or domain. This paper proposes composing models across vision, language, and audio domains to benefit from their diverse capabilities.- Emphasizes prompt engineering over model finetuning. Recent works have shown impressive capabilities from prompting large language models. This paper extends the idea to multimodal prompting and guiding model interactions through language. It contrasts with joint finetuning of multimodal models common in areas like VQA.- Demonstrates strong zero-shot transfer. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot image captioning and video retrieval. It also enables new applications like open-ended video QA without task-specific training. This shows the flexibility of composing pretrained models.- Introduces the concept of "language-based world-state history". Converting videos to textual histories enables video QA to be treated as reading comprehension, a natural fit for language models. This is a novel perspective different from typical video QA training.- Qualitative new applications beyond existing benchmarks. The paper shows various interactive systems leveraging Socratic Models that are not well characterized by current standard datasets. This highlights the broader potential.Overall, the emphasis on model composability, zero-shot transfer learning, and qualitative applications differentiates this work from prior multimodal research primarily focused on joint training and benchmark performances. The proposed framework opens interesting new directions for building capable AI systems without additional data collection or training.
