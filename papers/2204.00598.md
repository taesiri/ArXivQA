# [Socratic Models: Composing Zero-Shot Multimodal Reasoning with Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00598)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can multiple large pretrained "foundation" models be composed in a zero-shot manner, without additional training or finetuning, to create multimodal AI systems that leverage the complementary strengths of each model?

The key ideas and hypotheses proposed are:

- Large pretrained models (e.g. BERT, GPT-3, CLIP) exhibit distinct capabilities that depend on the domain of data they are trained on. For example, visual-language models are trained on image captions while language models are trained on large text corpora.

- These models encode different forms of commonsense knowledge across domains that are complementary. 

- Rather than scaling up multimodal training data or unifying model architectures, these complementary capabilities can be leveraged through "Socratic Models" - a modular framework to compose models via language-based prompting without additional training.

- New multimodal tasks can be formulated as guided discussions between models (e.g. VLM, LM, ALM) to exchange information and make joint predictions through language prompts.

- This allows creating systems that combine capabilities across modalities (vision, language, audio) in a zero-shot manner for tasks like image/video captioning, video QA, robot planning etc.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that heterogeneous pretrained models can be composed zero-shot via language prompting to create multimodal systems, by having the models exchange knowledge through structured dialogue without additional training. The paper demonstrates this through the proposed Socratic Models framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing the Socratic Models (SMs) framework, which composes multiple large pretrained models through language-based discussions (prompting) without requiring additional training. This provides a new way to build multimodal AI systems by combining complementary pretrained models in a zero-shot manner.  

2. Introducing key components of SMs such as multimodal prompting methods and the concept of a language-based "world state history" for video understanding.

3. Demonstrating strong quantitative performance of example SM systems on benchmarks like image captioning, video-to-text retrieval, and contextual image captioning/description. The systems match or exceed prior state-of-the-art in several zero-shot settings.

4. Providing additional application examples of SMs on tasks like open-ended egocentric video question answering, multimodal dialogue assistants, and robot perception and planning. This showcases the flexibility of the framework.

5. Discussing perspectives on building modular and interpretable AI systems from heterogeneous pretrained models, without requiring additional training or finetuning.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be proposing and demonstrating the SMs framework for composing complementary pretrained models through language-based discussions, enabling new multimodal capabilities without model finetuning or training data. The paper showcases strong quantitative and qualitative results across diverse applications.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents Socratic Models, a modular framework that composes multiple large pretrained models through language-based prompting without additional training, enabling new multimodal capabilities and applications.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces Socratic Models, a new framework for combining multiple pretrained language models to perform multimodal reasoning tasks without requiring additional training or finetuning. Here are some key ways this work compares to other related research:

- Leverages complementary knowledge in different foundation models. Many prior works focus on scaling up training data and model sizes within a single modality or domain. This paper proposes composing models across vision, language, and audio domains to benefit from their diverse capabilities.

- Emphasizes prompt engineering over model finetuning. Recent works have shown impressive capabilities from prompting large language models. This paper extends the idea to multimodal prompting and guiding model interactions through language. It contrasts with joint finetuning of multimodal models common in areas like VQA.

- Demonstrates strong zero-shot transfer. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot image captioning and video retrieval. It also enables new applications like open-ended video QA without task-specific training. This shows the flexibility of composing pretrained models.

- Introduces the concept of "language-based world-state history". Converting videos to textual histories enables video QA to be treated as reading comprehension, a natural fit for language models. This is a novel perspective different from typical video QA training.

- Qualitative new applications beyond existing benchmarks. The paper shows various interactive systems leveraging Socratic Models that are not well characterized by current standard datasets. This highlights the broader potential.

Overall, the emphasis on model composability, zero-shot transfer learning, and qualitative applications differentiates this work from prior multimodal research primarily focused on joint training and benchmark performances. The proposed framework opens interesting new directions for building capable AI systems without additional data collection or training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Exploring methods for learning the Socratic Model interactions themselves, rather than having them be scripted. The paper notes that the interactions between models in their demonstrations are programmed with prompt templates, but learning these interactions could be an interesting direction for future work.

- Extending the inter-module edges in Socratic Models to include additional modalities beyond just language. The paper suggests passing images or other representations between modules, rather than only text.

- Investigating if elements of probabilistic inference could be incorporated, as an alternative to the purely language-based approach they demonstrate. They note relying only on language for model discussions has tradeoffs compared to Bayesian inference.

- Scaling up the number of participating models (or their outputs) in Socratic Model discussions, as a means to better approximate Bayesian-style inference from a frequentist perspective.

- Using chain-of-thought prompting or other techniques to elicit logical reasoning from language models to perform deductive reasoning or decompose problems through dialogue.

- Meta-learning the interactions between models themselves. The paper notes that their demonstrations use predefined prompts and flows between models.

- Applying Socratic Models to additional modalities like haptics or broader robotics applications. The paper focuses on language, vision and audio models.

- Developing methods for unsupervised learning of when and how to invoke different specialized modules, rather than relying on predefined heuristics.

- Exploring how to build Socratic Models that are more robust to unreliable outputs from component models.

In summary, key directions center on learning versus predefining model interactions, extending to more modalities, incorporating probabilistic or logical reasoning, scaling up model diversity, and adapting the framework to more applications. The authors propose Socratic Models as a promising new paradigm but note much more can be explored in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Socratic Models (SMs), a modular framework to compose multiple large pretrained foundation models through language-based interactions without requiring additional training or finetuning. SMs leverage the complementary knowledge and capabilities of models trained on different data domains (e.g. text, images, audio). The models communicate via language prompts to perform joint multimodal reasoning and inference on new downstream tasks. The paper demonstrates SMs on tasks like image captioning, video understanding, egocentric video QA, and robot planning, showing strong performance compared to prior work despite being zero-shot. A key idea is representing video summarically as a language-based "world state history" for QA. Overall, SMs provide a way to build capable multimodal systems by combining existing models' expertise, without costly model retraining. The results highlight promising opportunities to reuse and connect pretrained models for emerging applications.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents Socratic Models (SMs), a framework for composing multiple large pretrained models through structured language-based interactions without requiring finetuning. SMs leverage the complementary knowledge and capabilities of models trained on different domains of Internet data, such as visual language models, text language models, and audio language models. The key idea is to use language as a common representation for the models to exchange information, guided by templated prompts. The prompts facilitate multi-step reasoning between the models to make joint predictions for multimodal downstream tasks. Through several experiments, the paper demonstrates that SMs can achieve strong performance on tasks like image captioning, video-to-text retrieval, and contextual question answering on egocentric video. The results suggest that creatively combining existing models through Socratic dialogue enables new capabilities, without needing additional training.

The paper discusses the motivation, formulation, experimental results, applications, and broader impacts of SMs. Key components include the prompting strategies to facilitate information exchange between models. Experiments benchmark SMs on image captioning, video-to-text retrieval, and contextual reasoning about egocentric video. Additional applications like robotic planning and recipe assistants showcase the flexibility. The results overall indicate that SMs provide an interpretable approach to harnessing complementary pretrained models. Limitations relate to reliability and potential biases inherited from the composing models. Impact topics cover the reduced training needs and new capabilities, along with risks of easier malicious use without constraints of training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Socratic Models (SMs), a framework for composing multiple large pretrained language models in a modular way to perform multimodal reasoning and inference tasks. The key idea is to formulate new tasks as dialogues or exchanges between different modules, where language serves as the common representation for communication. For a given task, the framework sequences different modules - such as visual language models (VLM), language models (LM), audio language models (ALM) - where each module assists in transforming the output into a linguistic form that the next module can use for reasoning. The interactions between modules are scripted using prompt engineering without any finetuning. As a case study, the paper demonstrates SMs on tasks like image captioning, video-to-text retrieval and open-ended reasoning on egocentric videos. The results show that SMs can achieve strong performance by creatively combining complementary knowledge and capabilities from different pretrained models in a zero-shot manner.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be introducing a framework called Socratic Models (SMs) for combining multiple pre-trained foundation models in a complementary way to perform new multimodal tasks, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. The key ideas include:

- Large pre-trained models like BERT, GPT-3, CLIP etc. have shown impressive capabilities, but these depend on the training data domain. Models trained on different data distributions exhibit different capabilities.

- The paper proposes that these model differences are complementary and can be leveraged through structured dialogue using language as a common interface. Rather than scaling up multimodal training data or architectures, SMs compose models via prompting. 

- SMs are modules connected via language prompts and outputs. New tasks are formulated as exchanged between modules (e.g. vision, language, audio models and APIs). No training needed.

- The framework is demonstrated on tasks like image/video captioning, visual Q&A, multimodal dialogue, robot planning etc. Requires little data and engineering, while achieving strong quantitative results and new capabilities.

In summary, the key problem is leveraging heterogeneous pretrained models for multimodal applications without additional training. SMs aim to address this through compositionality and language-guided exchange between available modules.
