# [Order from chaos: Interplay of development and learning in recurrent   networks of structured neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Learning complex sequential patterns in neural networks requires memories of past activities to persist over timescales much longer than single neuron relaxation times. Recurrent networks can produce such long transients, but learning in these networks remains challenging.
- Existing biologically plausible learning methods for recurrent networks have issues related to locality, resource allocation, parameter scales or tuning.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose that many of these issues can be alleviated by incorporating dendritic information storage and computation. They specifically consider a 2-population network model, with a motor output and latent preparatory population.
- The network undergoes two phases - an initial development phase where a sparse scaffold of somato-somatic connections is formed between pyramidal neurons. This scaffold induces random delays and remains fixed after development.
- In the subsequent learning phase, a local, three-factor learning rule is used to adapt somato-dendritic synapses based on delayed signals transmitted through the somatic scaffold. This extracts useful signals to reshape latent dynamics into robust sequence generators.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates how a combination of a developmental scaffold and dendritic plasticity can enable robust and efficient sequence learning in recurrent networks.
- The model makes efficient use of resources, allowing complex sequence learning with few neurons.  
- Shows superior performance compared to reservoir computing approaches for sequence learning.
- Exhibits strong robustness to disturbances and wide range of network configurations.
- Relies only on local learning rules applied to synapses, increasing biological plausibility.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel bio-inspired network architecture and plasticity rule that enables robust sequence learning through an interplay of development and learning processes. The model is efficient, robust and more plausible than existing approaches.
