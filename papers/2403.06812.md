# [Monotone Individual Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies online learning with individual fairness constraints, where the goal is to maximize accuracy while ensuring similar individuals are treated similarly according to an unknown similarity metric. 
- The feedback on fairness is provided by auditors who can report perceived violations, but don't specify exact similarity metrics or distances.
- Prior work assumes single auditors, specific parametric forms for metrics, or requires auditors to report all violations. This paper aims to generalize the frameworks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a model of "monotone auditing schemes" that can aggregate feedback from multiple auditors using a rich class of aggregation functions. 
- A characterization is provided, showing these schemes are equivalent to single instance-specific auditors, simplifying the analysis.
- Algorithms are presented based on a careful Lagrangian combination of accuracy and fairness losses with changing tradeoff rates over time. 
- Contextual bandit style reductions are used for computational efficiency, requiring only ~O(1) optimization oracle calls per round instead of T.

Main Contributions:
- General framework for individual fairness auditing via monotone aggregation schemes over multiple auditors
- Characterization simplifying the analysis of such schemes  
- New algorithms improving regret and violations bounds compared to prior work
- Greatly reduced per-round computational complexity from T to ~O(1) optimization oracle calls
- Extensions to partial feedback settings with improved bounds over prior work

In summary, the paper significantly expands the frameworks, algorithms and analysis for online learning with individual fairness constraints based on limited violation feedback. The introduced techniques provide both theoretical and practical advancements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a framework for online learning algorithms to make predictions that balance accuracy and individual fairness, with theoretical guarantees on regret and number of fairness violations, while relying on limited feedback from human auditors regarding perceived unfairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a new framework for auditing individual fairness violations that can aggregate feedback from multiple auditors using a rich class of monotone aggregation functions. It provides a characterization showing that under this framework, auditing by multiple auditors reduces to auditing by a single instance-specific auditor.

2) It presents new oracle-efficient algorithms for online learning with individual fairness under both full and partial (one-sided) feedback that improve upon prior work in terms of the regret and fairness violation bounds obtained. The algorithms are based on a careful dynamic combination of the accuracy and fairness objectives using a Lagrangian formulation. 

3) The algorithms significantly reduce the computational complexity compared to prior work, requiring only Õ(1/α^2) optimization oracle calls per round in the full information setting and Õ(1/α^2 + k^2T^(1/3)) calls in the partial information setting. This is a large improvement over prior algorithms that required T oracle calls per round.

4) The work provides general achievability results for the accuracy-fairness tradeoff, giving an entire frontier of possible rates for regret and fairness violations. It shows the flexibility of the framework and algorithms to explore different operating points along this frontier.

In summary, the main contribution is an improved auditing framework, faster algorithms, and a characterization of the accuracy-fairness tradeoff for online learning with individual fairness constraints. The work advances the state-of-the-art both conceptually and technically.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Individual fairness: The notion that similar individuals should receive similar outcomes or treatment. A core focus of the paper.

- Online learning: The paper studies an online learning framework where a learner makes predictions sequentially and can update its model over time. 

- Regret bounds: The paper analyzes the regret of the learner, which measures how much worse the online learner performs compared to the best fixed classifier. 

- Fairness violations: The paper introduces auditors that can report perceived fairness violations to the learner when similar individuals receive very different predictions. Minimizing violations is a goal.  

- Oracle efficiency: The algorithms presented are oracle-efficient, meaning they can leverage offline optimization oracles and have polynomial runtime given access to such oracles.

- Partial information: One setting studied assumes the learner has access to labels only for positively predicted individuals, making the problem more challenging.

- Monotone auditing schemes: The paper defines and analyzes this class of schemes for aggregating auditor feedback about fairness violations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper presents a novel framework for auditing individual fairness violations using monotone aggregation functions. How does this framework for auditing extend upon prior work, and what new capabilities does it enable? What are some examples of aggregation functions that would qualify as monotone in this context?

Walk through the details of the proof of this result. What insights does this characterization provide? How does it simplify the design and analysis of algorithms?

3. The paper introduces a regularized Lagrangian formulation for dynamically combining accuracy and fairness objectives. Explain the motivation behind this approach and why a static tradeoff parameter can be suboptimal. How does the online gradient descent algorithm exploit this formulation?

4. Walk through the details of how the reduction to Context-FTPL and Online Gradient Descent leads to an oracle-efficient algorithm for the full information setting. What is the intuition behind using two different policies for constraint elicitation vs. loss evaluation?

5. The algorithm for the partial information setting combines ideas from the full information case with Context-Semi-Bandit-FTPL. Explain how the analysis addresses the key challenges introduced by one-sided label feedback. 

6. How do the regret and fairness violation bounds for the full and partial information settings compare with prior work? What insights enabled the improvement of these rates? Are the rates optimal or could they be further improved?

7. Discuss the computational efficiency advantages of the proposed algorithms in terms of the number of calls to the optimization oracle per round. How significant are these improvements over prior oracle-efficient approaches?

8. The paper considers competing with a relaxed comparator class in terms of violation size. Discuss the possibility of and challenges associated with competing directly against policies with no relaxation. Is it possible to achieve this?

9. What limitations remain in the approach proposed in this work? Discuss possible directions for addressing them through extensions of the techniques introduced here.
