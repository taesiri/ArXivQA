# [The Fine-Grained Complexity of Gradient Computation for Training Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04497)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) require alternating forward and backward computations (function evaluation and gradient calculation) during training. 
- Prior work has shown that the forward computation step has a sharp threshold - it can be done in near-linear time when parameter magnitudes are small, but is provably hard when they are large. 
- It was unknown whether similar results hold for the computationally harder backward/gradient step. Resolving this is pivotal to characterize training complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- This paper shows an identical threshold phenomenon also emerges in the backward step.  
- When parameter magnitudes are small enough ($B=o(\sqrt{\log n})$), they design a near-linear time algorithm.
- When magnitudes are too large ($B=\omega(\sqrt{\log n})$), they prove no substantially faster algorithms can exist unless the popular $\mathsf{SETH}$ hypothesis fails. 

Key Technical Contributions:
- Novel near-linear time algorithm for gradient computation by using low-rank approximation and tensor methods. Extends polynomial approximation ideas from the forward step.  
- First computational lower bound for attention gradient calculation, via a reduction from the hard case of forward computation. Carefully handles gradient stability.

Impact:
- Fully characterizes the fine-grained complexity of every step of LLM training, pinpointing exactly when faster algorithms are possible.  
- Guides designers towards smaller parameter regimes for efficiency, or suggests focusing innovation elsewhere when parameters must be large.
- Underscores fundamental limitations in scaling up LLMs, contingent upon $\mathsf{SETH}$.

Overall, the paper completes our understanding of both forward and backward complexity in LLMs using new algorithms and lower bound techniques.
