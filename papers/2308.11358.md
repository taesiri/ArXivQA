# [How Much Temporal Long-Term Context is Needed for Action Segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11358)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance in temporal action segmentation?

The key points are:

- Temporal action segmentation involves recognizing start and end times of actions in long videos. Modeling long-term context is important but computationally expensive.

- Recent works use transformers with local temporal attention windows rather than full context. This limits their performance. 

- The authors evaluate impact of input window size on two datasets. Using full video context substantially outperforms using only a window, especially for long videos.

- They propose an architecture using sparse attention to capture full video context along with windowed attention for local context. 

- Their model outperforms state-of-the-art on two datasets while being efficient enough to handle very long videos.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that using the full temporal context of long videos is critical for optimal temporal action segmentation, and they design a model to test this while remaining efficient.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- The paper analyzes how much long-term temporal context is needed for temporal action segmentation. Through experiments, it shows that using the full video context leads to better performance compared to using only a temporal window. 

- It proposes a new model called LTContext that can leverage both local and long-term temporal context for action segmentation in long videos. This is achieved by combining windowed attention to model local context with sparse attention to capture long-term dependencies.

- LTContext achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging datasets - 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. In particular, it shows strong performance on Assembly101 which has long videos up to 25 minutes.

- The paper provides an in-depth analysis of different components of the LTContext model through ablation studies. This includes analyzing the impact of different attention types, window sizes, number of layers, cross-attention, convolutions, etc.

In summary, the key contribution is a new transformer-based model for temporal action segmentation that can effectively leverage both local and long-term context even for very long videos. This is enabled by the combination of windowed and sparse attentions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance in temporal action segmentation, and proposes a transformer-based model with sparse attention to efficiently capture full video context while still modeling local frame relations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several noteworthy contributions to the field of temporal action segmentation:

- It analyzes the impact of modeling long-term temporal context, finding that full video context is important for optimal performance compared to just using a local temporal window. This provides an empirical justification for designing models that can capture long-term dependencies. 

- The proposed LTContext model combines both local windowed attention and global sparse attention within the same architecture. This allows it to model both fine-grained local context as well as dependencies over the full video. The ablation studies demonstrate the importance of both components.

- The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging datasets including 50Salads, Breakfast and Assembly101. Notably it outperforms prior work like ASFormer and UVAST that also use attention but only within local windows. This highlights the benefits of LTContext's ability to model global context.

- Compared to methods like ASFormer and UVAST, LTContext is significantly more efficient and faster to train on very long videos like those in Assembly101. This makes it more practical to apply to real-world untrimmed video datasets.

- The design of iterating between local and global attention could potentially be useful for other sequential modeling tasks involving very long sequences, beyond just video temporal segmentation.

Overall, this work makes both empirical and modeling contributions. It demonstrates the importance of long-term modeling empirically, and proposes an efficient architecture for combining local and global context. The strong results validate the benefits of the LTContext model, advancing state-of-the-art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to model even longer temporal context beyond the full video. The authors show the importance of long-term context, but there may still be room for improvement by aggregating context across multiple videos. This could help better understand the structure and semantics of complex activities.

- Exploring different ways to integrate long-term and local context beyond their proposed approach. For example, adapting methods like the sparse transformers in other vision tasks to the temporal dimension. 

- Applying the idea of iterative modeling of local and global context to other sequence modeling tasks like speech and language. The authors suggest this approach may be broadly useful.

- Extending the model to multi-modal inputs, like combining visual features with language or audio. The additional modalities could provide useful contextual cues.

- Evaluating the approach on a wider range of datasets, especially those with more complex activities and longer sequences.

- Reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements further to scale to even longer videos and enable applications to streaming video.

- Exploring different segmentation and alignment methods on top of the encodings, as their model still shows some errors in precisely aligning segments.

So in summary, the main directions are developing techniques to handle even longer context, integrating local and global modeling in different ways, applying the approach to other modalities and tasks, scaling to more complex and longer datasets, and improving the segmentation alignments.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance in temporal action segmentation. Previous works have combined temporal convolutional networks with local self-attention, but this limits their ability to capture the full context of a video. The authors first analyze the impact of input window size on two datasets, finding that using the full video context gives better performance compared to a temporal window, especially for long videos. Based on this analysis, they propose a transformer-based model called LTContext that uses sparse attention to capture long-term context and windowed attention for local context. LTContext outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets - 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly101. The results demonstrate the importance of modeling the full temporal context for accurate temporal action segmentation, especially for long videos. Key components include the combination of sparse and windowed attention, multi-stage architecture with cross-attention, and dilated temporal convolutions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines how much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance in temporal action segmentation. Previous works have combined temporal convolutional networks with self-attention modules computed only over a local temporal window due to the computational cost of modeling long videos. However, the paper argues that limiting attention to a local window impacts performance. Through experiments, the authors show that allowing the model to operate on the full video sequence substantially improves accuracy compared to using only a subset of the input. 

Based on this analysis, the authors propose LTContext, a transformer-based model for temporal action segmentation. LTContext uses sparse attention to capture long-term context across the full video and windowed attention to model local information between neighboring frames. This flexible design provides both local and global temporal context. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The authors also conduct extensive ablation studies analyzing the impact of different architectural choices. Key findings are that combining windowed and sparse attention is optimal, and using multiple attention heads does not improve results. Overall, the work provides valuable insights into the importance of long-term context for temporal action segmentation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a transformer-based model called LTContext for temporal action segmentation that is able to capture both long-term and local temporal context in long videos. 

The key idea is to use a combination of sparse attention and windowed attention within the LTContext blocks of the model. The sparse attention can capture dependencies between distant frames in the full video while being computationally efficient. The windowed attention focuses on modeling the local context between neighboring frames. 

Specifically, the LTContext block first applies a 1D dilated convolution on the input features. This is followed by a windowed attention module that divides the sequence into non-overlapping windows and computes self-attention for each window. Next, a long-term context attention module reorders the sequence such that attention is computed sparsely over frames from the entire video. The block outputs residuals that are added back to the original features. Multiple LTContext blocks are stacked to form the encoder. The model also uses cross-attention in later stages and predicts the framewise labels through multiple classification heads after each stage.

In summary, the key contribution is a transformer architecture for temporal action segmentation that combines windowed attention to model local context with sparse attention over long sequences to capture global context across the full video. This provides an effective approach for action segmentation in long untrimmed videos.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem/question it is addressing is:

How much long-term temporal context is needed for optimal performance in temporal action segmentation? 

The paper notes that modeling long-term context in videos is crucial for fine-grained tasks like temporal action segmentation, where the goal is to recognize the start and end times of all actions in a video. However, an open question is how much long-term temporal context is actually needed to achieve the best performance. 

While transformers can model long-term context, this becomes computationally expensive for very long videos. Recent works have thus combined transformers with temporal convolutions, but use self-attention only on local temporal windows rather than the full video context.

The paper aims to analyze the impact of the window size and determine whether modeling the full long-term context of a video can further improve temporal action segmentation performance compared to just using local windows. The key research question is about quantifying how much context is optimal.

In summary, the main problem is understanding how much temporal long-term context is required for the best temporal action segmentation, which prior works have not directly analyzed. The paper tries to answer this question through experiments manipulating the input temporal context.
