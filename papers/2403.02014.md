# [Unveiling Hidden Links Between Unseen Security Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a proliferation of software vulnerabilities being reported, posing challenges for security databases and analysts to timely identify, classify, and address them. 
- With over 28,830 vulnerabilities reported in NVD in 2023, manual analysis becomes very time-consuming and error-prone.  
- It takes a long time (sometimes months) to fully understand the scope of vulnerabilities by linking them to affected products and weakness types. Over 6% of CVEs receive product updates 30+ days after being recorded.
- 25-44% of CVEs have missing or inconsistent weakness labels across databases like NVD and Red Hat, causing confusion.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents VulnScopper, a novel multi-modal approach combining knowledge graphs (KG) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate and enhance vulnerability analysis.
- It builds a vulnerability knowledge graph linking CVEs, CWEs and CPEs with 12 relation types.
- It leverages ULTRA, a KG foundation model for link prediction, to handle graph scalability and inductive settings with unseen nodes.   
- It further augments ULTRA's capabilities by integrating contextual embeddings from LLMs like Ada to boost accuracy.

Key Contributions:
- VulnScopper achieved 70-76% Hits@10 accuracy in linking CVEs to CWEs and CPEs, outperforming prior works.
- It improved CWE prediction over LLMs like ChatGPT by 11.7% on the Red Hat database.
- Case studies on recent vulnerabilities like Log4Shell and libwebp showed it can uncover new affected products not yet linked in NVD.
- It eliminates the need to retrain models for new vulnerabilities, focusing analyst efforts.
- It provides a path towards a multi-modal cybersecurity foundation model combining structural and textual knowledge.

In summary, VulnScopper moves towards an AI-assisted system to help analysts scope vulnerabilities faster by leveraging knowledge graphs and language models. This can dramatically reduce exposure times and strengthen vulnerability management.
