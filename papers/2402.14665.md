# [Quadruplet Loss For Improving the Robustness to Face Morphing Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14665)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Face recognition systems (FRS) are vulnerable to sophisticated image manipulation attacks like face morphing, which creates fraudulent images that can match different individuals. Ensuring FRS robustness against face morphing attacks is crucial for secure biometric identification.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel quadruplet loss function to improve FRS robustness against face morphing attacks. The key ideas are:

1) Sample face image quadruplets containing an anchor, a positive sample of the same identity, a negative sample of different identity, and a morph between positive and negative. 

2) Introduce a quadruplet loss that minimizes distance between anchor and positive while maximizing distance between anchor and negative, anchor and morph, negative and morph. This enlarges differences between originals and morphs.

3) Use customized sampling strategy to create quadruplet batches for Siamese network training.

Main Contributions:

- Formulation of a quadruplet loss tailored to improving robustness against face morphing by incorporating face morphs into the loss.

- Sampling strategy to create effective quadruplet batches containing original face images and corresponding morphs.

- Experiments showing proposed approach enhances resilience of face recognition networks to morphing attacks better than triplet loss baseline.

- Introduction of new benchmarks and metrics to quantitatively estimate robustness against face morphing attacks.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards improving face recognition security by developing a novel quadruplet loss and sampling strategy that demonstrably enhances robustness against sophisticated face morphing attacks.
