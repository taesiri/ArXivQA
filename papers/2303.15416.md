# [3D Video Object Detection with Learnable Object-Centric Global   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15416)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we effectively leverage long-term temporal visual correspondence to improve 3D video object detection, handling both static and moving objects?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question are:

- Proposing a new 3D video object detection paradigm called BA-Det that jointly learns object detection and temporal correspondence.

- Designing an object-centric temporal correspondence learning (OTCL) module to match features across frames. 

- Formulating a featuremetric object bundle adjustment loss to supervise correspondence learning.

- Conducting object-centric bundle adjustment at inference to globally optimize object poses using learned correspondences.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Dataset while handling both static and moving objects and utilizing long-term temporal information.

In summary, the paper explores utilizing long-term temporal visual correspondence in an object-centric manner to improve 3D video object detection, which is the central hypothesis and contribution. The proposed BA-Det method provides an effective way to achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new 3D video object detection method called BA-Det, which utilizes long-term temporal visual correspondence through object-centric bundle adjustment. 

2. It designs an object-centric temporal correspondence learning (OTCL) module to match dense features of the same object across frames. This allows handling both static and moving objects.

3. It formulates a featuremetric object bundle adjustment loss to make traditional bundle adjustment end-to-end learnable. This supervises the joint learning of object detection and temporal correspondence.

4. During inference, it optimizes the object poses globally using the learned correspondences, refining the single-frame detections.

5. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed object-centric bundle adjustment approach for 3D video object detection.

In summary, the key contribution is a new paradigm for 3D video object detection that jointly learns object detection and long-term temporal correspondence in an object-centric manner, enabling optimization of object poses globally across frames. The proposed BA-Det method outperforms prior arts on a challenging dataset.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a 3D video object detection method called BA-Det that jointly learns object detection and long-term temporal feature correspondence between objects across frames, and performs object-centric bundle adjustment to globally optimize object poses in a video.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in 3D video object detection:

- This paper proposes a new approach called BA-Det that utilizes long-term temporal visual correspondence for 3D video object detection. Most prior work either ignores temporal information or only uses it in a limited way (e.g. short-term frame aggregation). BA-Det is novel in learning object-centric temporal correspondence across many frames.

- A core contribution is the object-centric bundle adjustment loss that supervises the learning of temporal correspondence. This makes the traditional bundle adjustment process from SLAM differentiable and end-to-end learnable. Other methods like DfM and BEVFormer don't have an end-to-end learnable correspondence module.

- BA-Det is designed to handle both static and moving objects in a unified way via the object-centric formulation. Methods relying on epipolar geometry like DfM struggle with moving objects. BA-Det avoids this issue.

- Experiments show BA-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset, outperforming other top methods like BEVFormer, DCD, and MV-FCOS3D++. The ablations also demonstrate the importance of the long-term correspondence modeling.

- BA-Det requires minimal additional computation compared to single-frame detectors (<50ms per frame), while methods like BEVFormer and MV-FCOS3D++ rely more on expensive 3D convolutions and dense feature propagation across frames.

In summary, BA-Det introduces a new paradigm for exploiting long-term temporal correspondence in an end-to-end object-centric manner. This allows it to effectively leverage video data while handling both static and dynamic objects. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and efficient computation.
