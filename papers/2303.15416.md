# [3D Video Object Detection with Learnable Object-Centric Global   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15416)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we effectively leverage long-term temporal visual correspondence to improve 3D video object detection, handling both static and moving objects?

The key ideas and contributions to address this question are:

- Proposing a new 3D video object detection paradigm called BA-Det that jointly learns object detection and temporal correspondence.

- Designing an object-centric temporal correspondence learning (OTCL) module to match features across frames. 

- Formulating a featuremetric object bundle adjustment loss to supervise correspondence learning.

- Conducting object-centric bundle adjustment at inference to globally optimize object poses using learned correspondences.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Dataset while handling both static and moving objects and utilizing long-term temporal information.

In summary, the paper explores utilizing long-term temporal visual correspondence in an object-centric manner to improve 3D video object detection, which is the central hypothesis and contribution. The proposed BA-Det method provides an effective way to achieve this goal.
