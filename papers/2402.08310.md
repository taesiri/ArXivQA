# [One-to-many Reconstruction of 3D Geometry of cultural Artifacts using a   synthetically trained Generative Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08310)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reconstructing lost or damaged cultural artifacts is important to preserve history and understand past cultures. However, often only low-quality sketches or drawings of the artifacts remain. Reconstructing 3D models from such limited input is very challenging. Prior methods using deep learning require large training datasets which are unavailable for most cultural artifacts. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a fully automatic approach to reconstruct 3D geometry of cultural artifacts from a single low-quality sketch. The method relies on pre-trained state-of-the-art generative models like GANs and diffusion models that are fine-tuned on synthetic data. This allows adoption even with minimal real training data.  

The input sketch image is pre-processed to clean up the signal. The processed image is passed to an image inpainting model to fill in any missing areas. The restored sketch then serves as input to the PITI diffusion model which is fine-tuned to generate depth and normal maps. These maps are finally used to reconstruct 3D point clouds and mesh models.

Additional inputs like text prompts can be integrated to guide the reconstruction and allow interactive editing. This can enable domain experts to reconstruct potential appearances of lost artifacts.

Main Contributions:

- Literature review of one-to-many generative 3D reconstruction approaches applicable to cultural heritage

- Demonstration of state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion models for reconstructing 3D geometry from simple sketches of cultural artifacts

- Proposal of an interactive authoring tool for domain experts to reconstruct artifacts based on images and text prompts

The method is illustrated by reconstructing 3D models from photographs of medieval sketches. Qualitative results showcase detailed reconstructions for similar artifacts. Future work includes using multiple input modalities and evaluating the proposed expert tool.
