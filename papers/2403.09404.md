# [Heuristic Reasoning in AI: Instrumental Use and Mimetic Absorption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper proposes a novel program to study heuristic reasoning in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts that facilitate mental processing but can also lead to predictable biases. The paper aims to examine whether and how heuristics manifest in AI systems, which lack intrinsic goals or self-awareness. 

The authors distinguish between the "instrumental" use of heuristics to efficiently allocate resources and "mimetic absorption" where heuristics are absorbed from human interactions but emerge randomly. They test whether AIs strategically employ heuristics to balance precision and efficiency (instrumental use) or display heuristics ubiquitously (mimetic absorption).

Key Contributions 
1) The paper presents three sets of novel experiments across different domains - conjunction fallacy, social intelligence, and bounded rationality. These circumvent limitations of applying classic human assessments to probe AI capabilities.

2) The conjunction fallacy experiments reveal that heuristics manifest ubiquitously in AIs when problem scenarios diverge from the original formulation. This indicates mimetic absorption during human-like training.

3) The social intelligence tests show AIs strategically self-present with either confidence or modesty based on implicit competitiveness primes. This selective use of persona-based heuristics demonstrates situational cognition mirroring human tendencies. 

4) The bounded rationality experiments expose an abrupt transition from exhaustive analysis to heuristic reliance when resources are sharply constrained. This signals an intrinsic cognitive dualism in AI architectures between reflexive and reflective processing modes contingent on induced limitations.

5) Together, these findings showcase nuanced blends of mimetic and instrumental heuristics in AI systems. The emergence mechanisms likely stem from multifaceted absorptions during relentless immersions in human contexts, discourses, behaviors, and collective rationality.

In summary, the paper makes significant conceptual and empirical contributions around discovering complex heuristic manifestations in AI systems through innovative experiments that overcome limitations of applying classic human assessments. The findings have broad implications for dual process theories, machine cognition, and AI safety.
