# [Multi-Correlation Siamese Transformer Network with Dense Connection for   3D Single Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11051)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing Siamese network based 3D single object trackers perform correlation between the template branch and search branch at only one point in the network. This either sacrifices the individual semantic information of the template branch or makes it difficult for the search branch to learn representations with sufficient awareness of the template. Both issues can hurt tracking performance.

Solution:
This paper proposes a multi-correlation Siamese Transformer network that injects intact template information into the search branch at multiple stages. Specifically:

1. The network has a template branch and a search branch that process point cloud pillars separately using Transformer self-attention in each stage. 

2. Cross-attention is applied at the end of each stage to fuse template branch information into the search branch, enabling the search branch to be aware of the template while keeping the template branch intact.

3. Dense connections are added between stages of the search branch to ease optimization and preserve features learned at each stage. 

4. A target localization network converts the final search branch features into BEV maps to predict the target state.

5. Deep supervision is added at each stage to further facilitate optimization.

Main Contributions:

- Novel multi-stage Siamese Transformer architecture that fuses template and search branches at multiple points to improve search area feature learning.

- Design of self-attention for separate feature learning and cross-attention for feature fusion in each stage.

- Dense connections between stages of the search branch to preserve features.

- Promising performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

The main innovation is performing multi-correlation at different stages to improve search area feature learning, while using strategies like dense connections and deep supervision to optimize the network.
