# [Imbalanced Adversarial Training with Reweighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13639v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1. How does adversarial training behave under imbalanced training data scenarios? Can existing imbalanced learning strategies like reweighting be directly applied to improve adversarial training in imbalanced settings?

2. What causes the poor performance of adversarial training methods on under-represented classes in imbalanced datasets? 

3. Can a new adversarial training method be developed to handle class imbalance and achieve better overall performance, especially on under-represented classes?

The authors first empirically study the behavior of adversarial training on imbalanced data and find that it suffers more on under-represented classes compared to natural training. Reweighting strategies commonly used in natural training are also found to be ineffective for adversarial training under imbalance. 

To understand the reasons behind these observations, the authors provide theoretical analysis showing that poor data separability in the learned feature space is a key factor. 

Based on these findings, the authors propose a new adversarial training framework called Separable Reweighted Adversarial Training (SRAT) which enhances feature separability and enables more effective reweighting to handle class imbalance.

In summary, the main research questions focus on understanding the limitations of existing adversarial training methods on imbalanced data, identifying root causes, and developing an improved adversarial training approach to address class imbalance. The central hypothesis is that improving feature separability will facilitate reweighting strategies for imbalanced adversarial training.
