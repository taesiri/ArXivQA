# [Disentangled Interaction Representation for One-Stage Human-Object   Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01713)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called Disentangled Interaction Representation (DIR) that enables one-stage human-object interaction (HOI) detection models to extract disentangled and interpretable interaction features, mimicking the representation learning strategy of two-stage methods. First, a Shunted Cross-Attention (SCA) mechanism is introduced to explicitly disentangle and extract human appearance, object appearance, and global context features using different cross-attention heads with imposed masks. Second, an Interaction-aware Pose Estimation (IPE) task is devised to efficiently encode human pose features relevant to the interactions using a novel attention module. Finally, the appearance and pose features are fused to form the overall interaction representation. Experiments show DIR can be readily applied to existing one-stage HOI detectors and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. The proposed SCA and IPE components are shown to be effective through ablation studies. Qualitative results demonstrate that DIR enables the model to integrate diverse interpretable cues in a disentangled manner, leading to more accurate HOI detection.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent one-stage human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods adopt a transformer decoder to collect image-wide cues for interaction prediction. However, the obtained interaction representations are entangled and lack interpretability. In contrast, traditional two-stage HOI detection methods benefit from disentangled and interpretable interaction representations composed of human/object appearance and human pose features. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a method called Disentangled Interaction Representation (DIR) that enables one-stage HOI detection models to extract disentangled interaction representations. 

First, a novel Shunted Cross-Attention (SCA) mechanism is introduced during training. It explicitly disentangles the cross-attention heads to extract human appearance, object appearance and global context features using different attention masks. This imposes no additional cost during inference.

Second, an Interaction-aware Pose Estimation (IPE) task is proposed to efficiently encode human pose features relevant to the interactions, using the same backbone and queries as interaction prediction. An Interaction-aware Pose Attention module captures the importance of each keypoint for the human-object pair.  

Finally, the appearance and pose features are fused via element-wise addition to form the disentangled interaction representation for one-stage HOI detection.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first approach to enable one-stage HOI detection models to extract disentangled interaction representations like two-stage methods.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets when applied to existing one-stage HOI detection models.

- COMPutationally efficient and plug-and-play. Can readily improve existing one-stage HOI detection models without introducing additional cost during inference.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling one-stage HOI detection methods to benefit from disentangled interaction representations through efficient disentanglement of appearance and pose cues. This consistently improves performance across models and datasets.
