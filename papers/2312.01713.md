# [Disentangled Interaction Representation for One-Stage Human-Object   Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01713)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called Disentangled Interaction Representation (DIR) that enables one-stage human-object interaction (HOI) detection models to extract disentangled and interpretable interaction features, mimicking the representation learning strategy of two-stage methods. First, a Shunted Cross-Attention (SCA) mechanism is introduced to explicitly disentangle and extract human appearance, object appearance, and global context features using different cross-attention heads with imposed masks. Second, an Interaction-aware Pose Estimation (IPE) task is devised to efficiently encode human pose features relevant to the interactions using a novel attention module. Finally, the appearance and pose features are fused to form the overall interaction representation. Experiments show DIR can be readily applied to existing one-stage HOI detectors and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets. The proposed SCA and IPE components are shown to be effective through ablation studies. Qualitative results demonstrate that DIR enables the model to integrate diverse interpretable cues in a disentangled manner, leading to more accurate HOI detection.
