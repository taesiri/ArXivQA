# [BenchLMM: Benchmarking Cross-style Visual Capability of Large Multimodal   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02896)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes BenchLMM, a novel benchmark to assess large multimodal models (LMMs) on their capability of reasoning images with different styles, including artistic styles (cartoon, painting, etc.), sensor styles (infrared, X-ray, etc.), and application styles (autonomous driving, defect detection, etc.). The paper reveals that existing LMMs, even the commercial model GPT-4V, generally underperform on non-common image styles compared to regular photographic images. Also, superior performance on common images does not guarantee better reasoning capability on other image styles. To enhance LMMs, the authors propose a simple yet effective style prompt enhancement method by instructing LMMs to predict image style first before answering questions. Moreover, through an error reflection analysis, the authors find commercially stronger LMMs like GPT-4V can provide detailed reasoning processes to self-diagnose mistakes, whereas open-source LMMs merely rephrase correct answers, showing intelligent LMMs should have such capability. The proposed benchmark and analysis offer comprehensive tools and insights to facilitate future LMM research towards more intelligent and versatile reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes BenchLMM, a new benchmark to assess large multimodal models' capabilities in reasoning images with diverse artistic, sensor, and application style shifts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing BenchLMM, the first benchmark that can assess LMMs' capabilities across different visual distribution shifts including artistic style, sensor style, and application style. 

2. Broadly benchmarking existing large multimodal models both qualitative and quantitatively, including commercial GPT-4V. The comprehensive benchmark analysis provides new insights into understanding LMMs.

3. Proposing Style Prompt Enhancement (SPE) as a versatile and training-free method to improve LMMs' reasoning capability by prompting them to predict the style first. Experiments validate the effectiveness.  

4. Conducting an error-reflection study by asking LMMs to analyze the cause of errors. The study reveals the importance of developing the error-reflection capability for more intelligent LMMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing BenchLMM for evaluating LMMs' robustness against visual distribution shifts and style prompt enhancement to improve LMMs. The benchmark analysis and findings provide useful guidances for future LMM research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Large Multimodal Models (LMMs): The paper focuses on evaluating the capabilities of large models that process both visual and textual data, such as GPT-4V and LLaVA.

- Visual reasoning: Assessing the ability of LMMs to understand images and answer questions about visual content.

- Cross-style capability: Testing how well LMMs can handle different image styles beyond common photographic images, including artistic, sensor, and application styles. 

- BenchLMM benchmark: The proposed benchmark to systematically evaluate LMMs across varied distribution shifts.

- Style Prompt Enhancement (SPE): A simple strategy introduced to improve LMM performance by prompting models to predict image style first. 

- Error-reflection capability: Analyzing whether LMMs can explain the reasons behind incorrect answers in order to diagnose their own mistakes.

In summary, the key focus is on benchmarking state-of-the-art large multimodal models on how robustly they can perform visual reasoning tasks across diverse image styles and distributions. The terms cover the models, objectives, benchmark design, analysis, and findings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a Style Prompt Enhancement (SPE) method to improve the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) on different image styles. How exactly does SPE work? Does it require additional model training or fine-tuning?

2. The SPE experiments show inconsistent improvement across different models and datasets. For example, LLaVA-1.5 generally obtains more benefits from SPE than InstructBLIP. What factors contribute to these inconsistent improvements? 

3. The paper finds that SPE brings smaller improvement when evaluated on application-specific datasets compared to artistic/sensor style datasets. What is the potential reason behind this? Does this indicate any limitations of SPE?

4. Can SPE be combined with other techniques like prompt-tuning or adaptive prompt learning to achieve better improvements? What are the challenges in integrating SPE with other techniques?

5. The paper shows GPT-4V has better error-reflection capabilities compared to open-source LMMs like LLaVA. What architectural differences allow GPT-4V to analyze its own errors better?

6. The error-reflection analysis requires providing the ground-truth answer to the model. In real-world usage, the correct answer may not be available. Are there other ways to enable error-reflection without the ground-truth? 

7. BenchLMM benchmark consists of distribution shifts in artistic, sensor and application styles. Besides these, what other kinds of distribution shifts are worth investigating for LMMs?

8. The paper focuses only on the visual reasoning capabilities of LMMs. How can the benchmarks and analysis be extended to evaluate other capabilities like common sense reasoning, mathematical reasoning etc.?

9. All the analysis is done by evaluating pre-trained LMM models. How can insights from BenchLMM be used to improve the training of LMMs to handle distribution shifts better?

10. The benchmark results show significant gaps in LMMs' cross-style capabilities. When can we expect LMMs to achieve human-level versatility across different styles and distributions? What key developments are needed to bridge this gap?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) focus on images in the common photographic style. However, models' capabilities on other visual styles remain unclear.
- It is important to assess models on diverse image styles including artistic styles, images from different sensors, and application-specific images.

Proposed Solution - BenchLMM Benchmark:  
- Constructs a benchmark with images covering artistic styles (cartoon, painting, sketch etc), sensor styles (infrared, X-ray, MRI), and application styles (remote sensing, robot navigation).
- Comprehensively evaluates several state-of-the-art models and reveals performance degradation on non-common styles. An LMM performing better on common style does not guarantee superior performance on other styles.

Proposed Method - Style Prompt Enhancement (SPE):
- Prompts the LMM to first predict image style, then answer the question conditioned on style information.
- Significantly boosts visual reasoning for different LMM architectures without additional tuning.

Other Analysis:
- Conducts an error reflection study by asking models to analyze their own mistakes. Reveals that more capable models can provide detailed reasoning processes.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark to systematically evaluate LMMs across diverse visual styles.
- Quantitative evaluation and comparison of multiple models including GPT-4V.
- Style Prompt Enhancement method to improve model performance without extra training.
- Analysis of error reflection capability important for developing more intelligent LMMs.

The paper sheds light on assessing and improving versatility of LMMs across different visual distributions, an important direction for developing robust intelligent assistants.
