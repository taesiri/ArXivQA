# ["When He Feels Cold, He Goes to the Seahorse"-Blending Generative AI   into Multimaterial Storymaking for Family Expressive Arts Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Family communication is pivotal for children's wellbeing and development, but can be disrupted by issues like technology overuse, work-family conflicts, etc. This can negatively impact family relationships.
- Expressive arts therapy, involving creative activities like storymaking, can help families understand dynamics and strengthen bonds. However, there is little HCI research on supporting families and therapists in storymaking-based expressive arts therapy sessions.  
- Also, the potential of using generative AI as an expressive material in such therapy remains unexplored. 

Proposed Solution:
- Conducted 5 weeks of AI-infused, multimaterial storymaking sessions with 7 families (18 participants) guided by a professional therapist. 
- Families combined analog materials (clay, legos etc.) and generative AI (Midjourney) to co-create stories and characters.
- Examined the outcomes, process and meaning of the therapy through the lens of Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC) framework. 
- Distilled desirable qualities to support children, parents and therapists in family expressive arts therapy.
- Provided design implications like supporting physicalization of AI content, constructing child avatars as self-symbols, moderating family communication via role-playing, and archiving co-created stories.

Main Contributions:
- Empirically explored the integration of generative AI as an expressive material in family storymaking-based expressive arts therapy.
- Revealed therapeutic meanings of AI interactions using ETC framework - e.g. empowering families, connecting life and stories.
- Derived interaction qualities for children (personal relevance), parents (discovering child's strengths) and therapists (observing family challenges).
- Provided design implications on areas like materializing AI content, role-playing for communication, transitional objects from AI etc. to inspire future HCI systems for supporting families and therapists.

The paper makes valuable contributions in characterizing and designing for AI-infused family therapy to strengthen family bonds and child wellbeing. The empirical study, ETC analysis and design implications significantly advance HCI knowledge in this important but less studied domain.
