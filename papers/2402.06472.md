# ["When He Feels Cold, He Goes to the Seahorse"-Blending Generative AI   into Multimaterial Storymaking for Family Expressive Arts Therapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Family communication is pivotal for children's wellbeing and development, but can be disrupted by issues like technology overuse, work-family conflicts, etc. This can negatively impact family relationships.
- Expressive arts therapy, involving creative activities like storymaking, can help families understand dynamics and strengthen bonds. However, there is little HCI research on supporting families and therapists in storymaking-based expressive arts therapy sessions.  
- Also, the potential of using generative AI as an expressive material in such therapy remains unexplored. 

Proposed Solution:
- Conducted 5 weeks of AI-infused, multimaterial storymaking sessions with 7 families (18 participants) guided by a professional therapist. 
- Families combined analog materials (clay, legos etc.) and generative AI (Midjourney) to co-create stories and characters.
- Examined the outcomes, process and meaning of the therapy through the lens of Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC) framework. 
- Distilled desirable qualities to support children, parents and therapists in family expressive arts therapy.
- Provided design implications like supporting physicalization of AI content, constructing child avatars as self-symbols, moderating family communication via role-playing, and archiving co-created stories.

Main Contributions:
- Empirically explored the integration of generative AI as an expressive material in family storymaking-based expressive arts therapy.
- Revealed therapeutic meanings of AI interactions using ETC framework - e.g. empowering families, connecting life and stories.
- Derived interaction qualities for children (personal relevance), parents (discovering child's strengths) and therapists (observing family challenges).
- Provided design implications on areas like materializing AI content, role-playing for communication, transitional objects from AI etc. to inspire future HCI systems for supporting families and therapists.

The paper makes valuable contributions in characterizing and designing for AI-infused family therapy to strengthen family bonds and child wellbeing. The empirical study, ETC analysis and design implications significantly advance HCI knowledge in this important but less studied domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper reports on a study exploring the use of generative AI as a creative material in family expressive arts therapy sessions, characterizing how it facilitates therapeutic storymaking and how future systems could be designed to support the needs of children, parents, and therapists in this context.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the conclusion section, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It empirically explores how to utilize image-based generative AI as expressive materials and support the needs of children, parents and therapists in the context of family expressive arts therapy. 

2. It highlights emerging outcomes and processes of storymaking-based expressive arts therapy combining generative AI and analog materials. 

3. It characterizes the therapeutic meanings of generative AI as expressive materials through the lens of the Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC) framework.

4. It contributes to an understanding of the desirable interaction qualities for children, parents and therapists to inform the design of systems to support storymaking based expressive arts therapy.

In summary, the key contribution is an in-depth empirical study exploring and characterizing the use of generative AI in family expressive arts therapy, providing insights into interaction qualities and design implications to support this context.

The paper explores the use of generative AI as an "expressive material" in family expressive arts therapy, specifically in the context of collaborative, multimodal storymaking activities. It examines how families, including parents and children, creatively engage with AI-generated images along with traditional art materials to co-construct therapeutic stories. Concepts from expressive therapies theory, like the Expressive Therapies Continuum, are applied to characterize the therapeutic affordances of AI-infused material interactions. The study also derives qualities that are desirable in supporting children, parents, and therapists during these AI-mediated family therapy storymaking activities. Finally, it offers design implications for future HCI systems aimed at facilitating generative AI-infused storymaking to strengthen family relationships and communication.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a professional therapist to conduct the five-week expressive arts therapy sessions. What specific considerations went into selecting and working with the therapist? What credentials and experience were required?

2. The paper states that both interview and observational data were collected. Can you elaborate on the specific interview questions and observational protocols used? What was the rationale behind this mixed methods approach?  

3. How were the specific expressive arts therapy activities (e.g. character making, storytelling) selected and structured? What therapeutic principles or frameworks guided this process?

4. What criteria were used to select the 7 participating families? Was any screening done to ensure suitability and diversity? If so, what measures were considered?  

5. The paper introduces the Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC) framework as a lens for analysis. Why was this particular framework chosen over others? How exactly was it applied during the qualitative analysis?

6. Can you expand on the iterative, collaborative inductive coding process for the interview transcripts? What steps were involved and how was inter-coder reliability ensured? 

7. How might the small sample size and single geographic location of participants limit the generalizability of findings? What mitigation strategies were used?

8. The paper proposes several desirable qualities for supporting children, parents and therapists. What empirical evidence from the study directly informed the formulation of these qualities?

9. What safeguards and ethical considerations were put in place when using AI generation, given the involvement of children? How was appropriateness of content ensured?

10. What future research directions could further validate, refine or build upon the methodological approach presented? What are some limitations and how might they be addressed?
