# [Randomized Quantization is All You Need for Differential Privacy in   Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11913)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can we harness randomization in quantization schemes to further improve privacy-accuracy trade-offs in differentially private federated learning?The paper introduces a new mechanism called the Randomized Quantization Mechanism (RQM) that aims to provide better trade-offs between privacy and accuracy in federated learning systems compared to prior work. The key idea is to leverage the inherent randomness in quantization schemes, which have primarily been used just for communication efficiency in past work, and design the quantization specifically to also enhance privacy guarantees. Their research explores whether randomizing the quantization itself can boost privacy without sacrificing too much accuracy.So in summary, the main question is whether the proposed RQM, through its randomized quantization approach, can advance the state-of-the-art in differentially private federated learning by achieving both stronger privacy guarantees and higher accuracy than existing mechanisms like the Poisson Binomial Mechanism. The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical results to investigate this research question.
