# [Improved Regret for Bandit Convex Optimization with Delayed Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09152)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of bandit convex optimization (BCO) with delayed feedback. In this setting, at each round $t$, the player selects an action $\x_t$ from a convex set. Then an adversary chooses a convex loss function $f_t(\x_t)$ that incurs a loss $f_t(\x_t)$ to the player. However, this loss is only revealed to the player after a delay of $d_t$ rounds. The goal is to minimize regret, which is the gap between the total loss of the player's actions and that of the best fixed action in hindsight. 

Prior work has developed algorithms for BCO with delayed feedback based on simply feeding the delayed losses into bandit gradient descent (BGD), achieving a regret bound of $O(T^{3/4} + d^{1/3}T^{2/3})$. However, it remains open whether the effect of delays on regret can be improved beyond $d^{1/3}T^{2/3}$.

Proposed Solution:
This paper develops a novel algorithm called Delayed Follow-The-Bandit-Leader (D-FTBL) that incorporates the delayed bandit feedback using a blocking update mechanism. Specifically, it divides the $T$ rounds into blocks and only updates the action at the end of each block using the sum of estimated gradients from the block. 

Main Contributions:

1. For general convex functions, D-FTBL achieves an improved regret bound of $O(T^{3/4} + \sqrt{dT})$, matching the $O(T^{3/4})$ regret of standard BGD without delays. This allows delays up to $d=O(\sqrt{T})$ without increasing regret.

2. For strongly convex functions, D-FTBL further improves the regret to $O(T^{2/3}\log^{1/3} T + d\log T)$, again matching standard BGD without delays for $d=O((T/\log T)^{2/3})$. 

3. In the unconstrained case with strongly convex and smooth functions, a simple variant of D-FTBL achieves $O(\sqrt{T\log T} + d\log T)$ regret.

4. The delay-dependent parts of these regret bounds match known lower bounds, implying the gains of D-FTBL over prior art are optimal up to constant factors.

In summary, the paper provides the first algorithm that breaks the joint effect of bandit feedback and delays on regret, establishing optimal or near-optimal regret bounds. The blocking update mechanism is vital to decouple the delays and enable these regret improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new algorithm called delayed follow-the-bandit-leader (D-FTBL) for bandit convex optimization with delayed feedback, which carefully exploits the delayed bandit feedback via a blocking update mechanism and achieves improved regret bounds that match existing results in the non-delayed setting for larger amounts of delay.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is developing an improved algorithm called delayed follow-the-bandit-leader (D-FTBL) for the problem of bandit convex optimization with delayed feedback. Specifically:

1) For general convex functions, D-FTBL achieves a regret bound of $O(T^{3/4} + \sqrt{dT})$, which matches the $O(T^{3/4})$ regret of standard bandit gradient descent without delays for up to $d=O(\sqrt{T})$ delays. This improves over the previous best regret of $O(T^{3/4} + d^{1/3}T^{2/3})$.

2) For strongly convex functions, D-FTBL achieves a regret bound of $O(T^{2/3}\log^{1/3} T + d\log T)$, which matches the regret for standard bandit gradient descent without delays for up to $d=O((T/\log T)^{2/3})$ delays. 

3) In the unconstrained setting with strongly convex and smooth functions, a simple variant of D-FTBL achieves $O(\sqrt{T\log T} + d\log T)$ regret, which matches the regret without delays for up to $d=O(\sqrt{T/\log T})$ delays.

In all cases, the delay-dependent part of the regret matches known lower bounds, implying the results for D-FTBL are tight. The key ideas enabling these improved regret bounds are carefully exploiting the delayed bandit feedback and using a blocking update mechanism.

The paper focuses on the problem of bandit convex optimization with delayed feedback, where the loss function values are revealed to the learner only after an arbitrary delay. It develops a new algorithm called delayed follow-the-bandit-leader (D-FTBL) that incorporates a blocking update mechanism to help decouple the joint effect of delays and bandit feedback. The paper provides regret analysis for D-FTBL under different assumptions like convexity, strong convexity and smoothness of the loss functions. It shows improved regret bounds compared to prior works, with the delay-dependent terms matching known lower bounds in certain cases. Key terms like BCO, delayed feedback, regret bounds, BGD, blocking updates, strong convexity etc. feature prominently through the problem formulation, algorithm design and analysis sections.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key idea of the proposed D-FTBL algorithm is to incorporate delayed bandit feedback with a blocking update mechanism. Can you explain in more detail why this helps improve the regret bound compared to prior work? What is the intuition behind how blocking updates reduce the effect of delays?

2. The analysis shows that the cumulative estimated gradients $\nabla_m$ at each block have nice properties in terms of bounded variance and block-level delays. Can you walk through the details on how these properties are derived and how they are utilized to decompose the joint effect of delays and bandit feedback?

3. The regret analysis relies on defining an ideal decision sequence $\{\y_m^\ast\}$. What is the motivation behind this definition and how does it connect to bounding the actual decisions $\{\y_m\}$ made by the algorithm?

4. One complexity in the analysis stems from bounding the difference $\|\y_m-\y_m^\ast\|_2$ which accounts for the effect of delays. Can you explain the steps taken in Equation (16) and beyond to arrive at the bound in terms of delayed gradients? 

5. For strongly convex functions, the algorithm and analysis are extended in certain ways. Can you highlight the key changes made compared to the convex case and the intuition for why they help improve the regret bound?

6. In the unconstrained smooth case, the regret can be further improved. Walk through how smoothness is exploited in the analysis and why taking actions from the set $\K^\prime$ is sufficient.

7. The blocking update idea has been used in other projection-free online learning algorithms. How does the analysis here differ from/relate to other blocking analyses you are familiar with?

8. One could imagine other ways to design the delayed bandit algorithm that might work. What modifications can you think of and what challenges do you foresee in analyzing them to achieve similar regret bounds? 

9. The algorithm assumes knowledge of certain bounds on the function classes as input parameters. Can these be removed or adapted online using common techniques like doubling tricks? Would the same regret rates still hold?

10. The paper states the regret bounds match information-theoretic lower bounds, indicating optimality. Take one of the cases (convex, strongly convex, smooth) and walk through the lower bound construction that verifies optimality.
