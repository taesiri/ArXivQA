## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AesopAgent: Agent-driven Evolutionary System on Story-to-Video Production":

Problem: 
Generating a coherent and engaging video from a user's story proposal is challenging as it requires effectively orchestrating various AI modules for tasks like script generation, image creation, and video assembly. Prior works have gaps in image expressiveness, narrative quality, and user engagement.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes AesopAgent, an agent-driven evolutionary system for automatically converting user story proposals into videos. The key components are:

1. Horizontal Layer: Uses agent techniques and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to continuously optimize the video generation workflow, prompt engineering, and utility usage based on expert experience and knowledge. This enables efficient task orchestration.

2. Utility Layer: Provides various utilities for consistent image generation and video assembly. For image generation, it ensures composition rationality, character consistency across shots, and unified style. For video assembly, it dynamically generates materials and aligns them precisely on the timeline.

Main Contributions:

1. Automates workflow orchestration for video generation using agents, including script creation, image generation and video assembly.

2. Proposes a RAG-based evolutionary system that collects expert experience and knowledge to iteratively improve system performance over time e.g. optimizing prompts. 

3. Achieves consistent image generation across shots through utilities for composition, character consistency and style unification. 

Comparisons show superiority over baselines in image rationality and fidelity. User engagement is enhanced by integrating additional software like Gen-2 animation utility. The system is adaptable for evolving user requirements like new themes, styles etc.
