# [Revisiting the Information Capacity of Neural Network Watermarks: Upper   Bound Estimation and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Protecting the intellectual property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is important as they become increasingly expensive to develop. Watermarking embeds the owner's identity into the model to prove ownership if stolen.  

- However, the information capacity of DNN watermarks is not well studied. There is no standard definition of capacity to allow comparison between schemes. The tradeoff between robustness, fidelity and capacity is also not analyzed.

Main Contributions:

1) New definition of DNN watermark capacity based on information theory. It characterizes the maximal volume of owner identity information that can be transmitted through the watermark channel within an allowed performance degradation after adversarial modifications.  

2) Designed algorithm to estimate the capacity upper bound under adversarial overwriting attacks. This gives a reliable and tight bound on capacity since it directly tampers with the watermark while preserving model performance.

3) Proposed a non-invasive method using multiple rounds of ownership verification with variational approximation to transmit more identity information bits than the capacity. It incorporates randomness against adversarial modifications and is applicable to any scheme.  

4) Studied capacity rigorously for different watermarking schemes. Derived the minimal identity message length and corresponding performance degradation to secure ownership given constraints. Showed the efficacy of the proposed verification method.

To summarize, this paper provides fundamental theoretical analysis of DNN watermark capacity. It defines capacity properly based on information theory, estimates tight bounds, and shows how to break the capacity limit to securely transmit more ownership information bits. The analysis on tradeoffs between fidelity, robustness and capacity offers useful guidelines for configuring watermarking schemes.
