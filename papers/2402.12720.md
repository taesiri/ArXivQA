# [Revisiting the Information Capacity of Neural Network Watermarks: Upper   Bound Estimation and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Protecting the intellectual property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is important as they become increasingly expensive to develop. Watermarking embeds the owner's identity into the model to prove ownership if stolen.  

- However, the information capacity of DNN watermarks is not well studied. There is no standard definition of capacity to allow comparison between schemes. The tradeoff between robustness, fidelity and capacity is also not analyzed.

Main Contributions:

1) New definition of DNN watermark capacity based on information theory. It characterizes the maximal volume of owner identity information that can be transmitted through the watermark channel within an allowed performance degradation after adversarial modifications.  

2) Designed algorithm to estimate the capacity upper bound under adversarial overwriting attacks. This gives a reliable and tight bound on capacity since it directly tampers with the watermark while preserving model performance.

3) Proposed a non-invasive method using multiple rounds of ownership verification with variational approximation to transmit more identity information bits than the capacity. It incorporates randomness against adversarial modifications and is applicable to any scheme.  

4) Studied capacity rigorously for different watermarking schemes. Derived the minimal identity message length and corresponding performance degradation to secure ownership given constraints. Showed the efficacy of the proposed verification method.

To summarize, this paper provides fundamental theoretical analysis of DNN watermark capacity. It defines capacity properly based on information theory, estimates tight bounds, and shows how to break the capacity limit to securely transmit more ownership information bits. The analysis on tradeoffs between fidelity, robustness and capacity offers useful guidelines for configuring watermarking schemes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the information capacity of deep neural network watermarks, proposes a capacity estimation method and a technique to increase capacity beyond its limit for more secure ownership verification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It gives the first information theory-based definition of DNN watermark capacity and shows how it is related to the accuracy, robustness, and expense of ownership verification. 

2) It designs a capacity estimation algorithm that yields a tight upper bound of the capacity of DNN watermarks under adversarial overwriting.

3) It proposes a variational approximation-based method to increase the accuracy of identity message transmission beyond the capacity by multiple rounds of ownership verification. This method can be generalized to arbitrary DNN watermarking schemes in a non-invasive manner.

In summary, the paper provides a theoretical framework to analyze DNN watermark capacity, proposes methods to estimate the capacity bound, and introduces techniques to transmit more information through the watermark channel beyond its capacity. The key insight is to leverage information theory and variational inference to address limitations of prior works on DNN watermark capacity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work on revisiting the information capacity of neural network watermarks include:

- Information capacity of neural network watermarks - This refers to the maximal amount of ownership identity information that can be embedded and reliably extracted from a watermarked neural network model. It is analogous to channel capacity in information theory.

- Channel capacity - The paper draws an analogy between the information embedding/extraction process of watermarks and digital communication through a channel, using concepts like channel capacity, mutual information, etc.

- Tradeoff between fidelity, robustness, and capacity - There are tradeoffs between how much information can be embedded, how much it affects model performance, and robustness to modifications.

- Adversarial overwriting attack - A strong attack the authors use to estimate a tight upper bound on capacity by directly overwriting the watermark with a different message. 

- Multiple rounds of ownership verification - A method proposed to transmit more identity bits than capacity by retrieving and averaging identity bits over multiple verification rounds with perturbations.  

- Variational approximation - Used to enable the multiple verification rounds method for blackbox watermark schemes by approximating the effect of parameter perturbations with perturbations to the ownership key.

In summary, key concepts include information capacity analogous to channel capacity, tradeoffs between fidelity/robustness/capacity, adversarial attacks for estimation, and techniques to exceed capacity like multiple rounds of verification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new definition of deep neural network watermark capacity analogous to channel capacity. How is this definition an improvement over previous capacity definitions for DNN watermarks? What key aspects does it capture that were missing before?

2. The paper analyzes several theoretical properties of the proposed DNN watermark capacity, including monotonicity, relation to bit error rate, and implications for the tradeoff between fidelity and robustness. Can you explain the significance of one of these properties in depth? 

3. The capacity estimation algorithm in the paper uses adversarial overwriting to find an upper bound on capacity. Why is adversarial overwriting expected to yield a tighter bound compared to other attacks like fine-tuning or pruning? Can you think of scenarios where it may not give the tightest bound?

4. The paper breaks the capacity bottleneck using multiple rounds of ownership verification with stochastic perturbations (MROV-V). Explain the intuition behind why MROV-V can transmit more information than the capacity limit. What is the role of the variational distribution matching in enabling MROV-V?

5. Compare and contrast the two MROV-V configurations proposed in the paper (MROV-V-1 and MROV-V-2). Under what conditions can MROV-V-2 give better capacity at the cost of worse fidelity compared to MROV-V-1?

6. The capacity definition in the paper relies on an evaluation metric $E(.)$ to measure model performance. How would your analysis change if you used accuracy, AUC-ROC, F1 score etc. instead? Are there metrics more suitable than others?

7. The paper assumes the adversary has full knowledge of the watermarking scheme. How could you modify the capacity analysis to account for an adversary with limited knowledge? Would this increase or decrease capacity?

8. Can the methods in this paper be applied to other machine learning models beyond deep neural networks? What challenges might arise?

9. The capacity definition relies on an information theoretic view of DNN watermarks. Can ideas from other fields like steganography also be used to derive capacity metrics? How do they compare?

10. The paper focuses on adversarial overwriting attacks for capacity evaluation. Can you think of other advanced attacks not explored that could potentially estimate tighter capacity bounds? How can the analysis be extended?
