# [OrderBkd: Textual backdoor attack through repositioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Use of third-party datasets and pre-trained ML models poses threat of hidden backdoor attacks in NLP systems. 
- Existing attacks alter semantics of texts or can be detected.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new backdoor attack "OrderBkd" that repositions two words in a sentence as the trigger, based on part-of-speech (POS) rules.
- Select an "adverb" or "determiner" as the word to reposition to lower position that minimizes perplexity. 
- Maintains semantics and is stealthier than existing attacks.

Main Contributions:
- Extremely simple trigger by just changing position of a single token based on POS tags.
- High stealthiness - much lower perplexity and higher semantic similarity compared to other attacks.
- Evaluated on SST-2 and AG News datasets with BERT, ALBERT, LSTM models. On par or slightly worse performance than existing attacks.
- Showed robustness to ONION defense method.

In summary, the paper introduces a new and stealthy backdoor attack for NLP that works by simply repositioning two words in a sentence based on POS tags. It is semantically consistent with the original texts while achieving high attack success. The simplicity and effectiveness of the attack raises concerns about security vulnerabilities of NLP systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes OrderBkd, a novel textual backdoor attack method that repositions words in sentences based on part-of-speech tags to serve as triggers, demonstrating high attack success rates while better preserving semantics compared to prior attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is summarized as follows:

1. They develop an extremely simple trigger which does not involve insertion or generation of any content. The trigger is based on changing the position of a single token in the original text sample, where the source and destination positions are determined by part-of-speech (POS) tags.

2. They study the stealthiness and semantics preservation properties of their trigger by measuring perplexity (PPL) and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) similarity. They find that among the attacks they tested, their attack is the only one having good values of both metrics, with only mild increase in perplexity compared to the clean samples and semantic similarity value close to one.

3. They evaluate OrderBkd attack on three BERT-based models and also evaluate autoregressive model XLNet and the recurrent neural network LSTM for two text classification tasks. According to the standard evaluation metrics, their attack is on par or slightly worse than existing attacks.  

4. They experimentally show the robustness of their attack to the ONION defense algorithm.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new backdoor attack that has a simple trigger based on changing the position of a single token, while preserving semantics and achieving comparable attack performance to existing methods. The attack is also robust to a defense algorithm.

The paper presents a new backdoor attack method called "OrderBkd" which involves repositioning words in a sentence based on their POS tags to serve as a trigger, while maintaining semantics and stealthiness. It evaluates the attack on text classification models and datasets, using metrics like perplexity, USE similarity, attack success rate and clean accuracy. It also shows the attack's robustness against the ONION defense method. The key focus is on developing a stealthy and semantics-preserving backdoor attack for NLP models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the main contribution of the OrderBkd attack compared to previous textual backdoor attacks? How does it aim to improve upon limitations of prior work?

2. Explain in detail the trigger used in the OrderBkd attack. How does it work to perturb the input text samples? What strategies are used to select the words to reposition? 

3. How does the OrderBkd attack choose the new position for the selected word to reposition within the input sentence? What metric guides this decision process?

4. What parts-of-speech does the attack utilize for selecting words to reposition? Why were adverbs and determiners chosen? How was this choice justified?

5. Walk through the overall process of the OrderBkd attack, including: selecting words for repositioning, determining their new positions, poisoning the training data, and training the victim model. 

6. How does the OrderBkd attack aim to preserve semantics and maintain stealthiness compared to other textual backdoor attacks? What metrics are used to evaluate on these criteria?

7. What datasets and victim models were used to evaluate the OrderBkd attack? How does the attack compare to baselines in terms of attack success rate and other relevant metrics?

8. What results demonstrate the robustness of the OrderBkd attack against defenses like ONION? How does it compare to other attacks with regards to bypassing this defense?

9. What ethical considerations and defenses does the paper discuss with regards to revealing this attack method? Do you think the authors make a reasonable case?

10. What directions for future work does the paper suggest to further analyze OrderBkd and develop appropriate defenses? What open questions remain about this style of attack?
