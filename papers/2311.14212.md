# [Annotation Sensitivity: Training Data Collection Methods Affect Model   Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14212)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of "annotation sensitivity" - the idea that the specific design of the annotation data collection process impacts both the collected annotations themselves as well as downstream model performance trained on those annotations. The authors test this through an experiment collecting hate speech and offensive language annotations for tweets under 5 different experimental annotation collection conditions that vary aspects like whether judgments are collected on the same or separate screens. They find substantial differences across conditions in the percentage of items labeled as hate speech or offensive, levels of annotation disagreement, model performance metrics, model predictions, and model learning curves when models are trained on each condition-specific dataset. For example, models trained on data from a condition that showed both annotation options on one screen performed worse at predicting offensive language compared to models trained on other conditions. The results highlight that details of the annotation process critically impact collected labels and model outcomes, suggesting annotation processes should be designed carefully and variation should be introduced. More research is needed to develop annotation collection best practices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper demonstrates that small changes to the design of annotation instruments impact the resulting annotations as well as downstream model performance and predictions, emphasizing the crucial role played by annotation instruments in machine learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

Introducing the concept of "annotation sensitivity" to refer to the impact of annotation data collection methods (specifically the design of the annotation instrument) on the annotations themselves as well as on downstream model performance and predictions. The paper demonstrates through experiments that small changes in the annotation instrument, such as changing the order of questions or splitting questions across screens, can significantly impact the annotation distributions, model performance, learning curves, and predictions. This highlights the important and underappreciated role of the annotation instrument in the model development pipeline. The authors call for more research into annotation sensitivity and best practices in instrument design.

In summary, the key contribution is defining and providing empirical evidence for the concept of annotation sensitivity in the context of hate speech detection.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Annotation sensitivity - refers to the impact of annotation data collection methods on the annotations themselves and on downstream model performance and predictions.

- Human annotation - the paper collects annotations from human labelers/annotators.

- Annotation instrument - refers to the interface, design, and questions used to collect annotations from humans.

- Task structure effects - variations in the annotation instrument, such as the wording and order of questions and response options, can change the annotations collected.  

- Hate speech - one of the annotation tasks in the paper is identifying hate speech in tweets.

- Offensive language - along with hate speech, the other main annotation task is identifying offensive language in tweets.

- Model performance - a key focus of the paper is assessing how annotation instrument design impacts downstream model accuracy, AUC, learning curves, etc.

- Data Centric AI - the paper situates itself within the growing focus on improving training data rather than just model tuning.

So in summary, key terms revolve around annotation sensitivity, human annotation collection, task structure effects, hate speech classification, and the impact on model performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "annotation sensitivity." How is this concept defined and what are its key components? What aspects of the annotation process does it encompass?

2. This study used five different experimental conditions for the annotation task design. Can you describe each of these conditions in detail and explain the key differences between them? What was the rationale behind testing these specific variations?

3. The paper finds considerable differences between the five experimental conditions in terms of the percentage of hate speech/offensive language annotations collected. What were some potential reasons proposed in the paper for why the task structure impacted the collected annotations?

4. Separate BERT models were trained on the annotations from each experimental condition. What was the train/validation/test split used for model training and evaluation? What metrics were used to evaluate model performance?

5. The results show row and column effects in Figures 3 and 4 demonstrating differences in model performance across training and testing conditions. What do these effects indicate and what possible explanations are provided in the paper? 

6. Learning curves were generated to study model training efficiency across conditions. Can you explain how these curves were created? What differences stood out between the learning curves for certain annotation conditions?

7. The paper emphasizes the importance of thoroughly documenting the annotation collection process. What are some ways proposed to incorporate variation in the task structure during data collection? Why is this useful?

8. What limitations of the study are acknowledged regarding the language, geography, and types of annotation tasks tested? How could future work address these limitations?  

9. The paper proposes studying order and fatigue effects in more depth in follow-up experiments. What specific suggestions are made to assess these effects? What metrics could be used?

10. How could the results inform best practices in designing annotation instruments? What aspects should instrument designers pay particular attention to based on these findings?
