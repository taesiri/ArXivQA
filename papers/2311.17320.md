# [Revisiting Single Image Reflection Removal In the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17320)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper revisits single image reflection removal (SIRR) by proposing an improved pipeline for collecting aligned real-world reflection image pairs and introducing an explicit reflection location estimation method called Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF). The new collection pipeline uses video capture with controlled blocking of reflections to obtain accurate transmission and reflection images, enabling larger-scale dataset collection. Based on aligned pairs from this pipeline, the authors observe that reflection layers contain textures not present in transmission layers. Leveraging this, MaxRF compares gradient maps of the pairs to directly characterize local reflection regions. These innovations facilitate the creation of a new large-scale paired reflection dataset called RRW. They also inspire a SIRR framework with an initial reflection detection network using MaxRF to estimate locations, followed by a reflection removal network using that guidance. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on real datasets, showing benefits of the explicit reflection localization and extra training data. Limitations remain for saturated reflections where transmission details are lost. Overall, the work makes notable contributions around an improved reflection data collection process, explicit reflection characterization, and a location-aware SIRR network architecture.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new pipeline for collecting aligned real-world reflection image pairs, a large-scale reflection dataset, an explicit reflection location characterization method, and a reflection removal network guided by estimated reflection locations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new pipeline for collecting real-world reflection image pairs that is more adaptable, independent of data format constraints, and enables cheaper large-scale data acquisition. 

2. Presenting a large-scale, high-quality paired reflection dataset called Reflection Removal in the Wild (RRW), which has 14,952 high-resolution real-world reflection pairs.

3. Proposing the Maximum Reflection Filter (MaxRF) to explicitly obtain representations that characterize reflection region locations.

4. Developing a cascaded network framework for single image reflection removal, which first estimates reflection locations using MaxRF and then removes reflections with guidance from the estimated locations.

5. Achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on real-world reflection removal benchmarks using the proposed innovations.

In summary, the main contributions are the proposed reflection pair collection pipeline, RRW dataset, MaxRF for explicit reflection location estimation, and the cascaded network framework that outperforms previous methods.
