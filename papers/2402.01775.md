# [Design and consensus content validity of the questionnaire for   b-learning education: A 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi based Decision   Support Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01775)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need to evaluate new b-learning (blending learning) educational experiences that combine flipped classroom and mobile learning (m-learning) methodologies. 
- However, there are no standardized questionnaires available to specifically measure student satisfaction and communication for such combined pedagogical approaches.
- Questionnaires need to be validated before use to ensure they accurately measure the intended concepts (content validity).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a "2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi" method to validate questionnaire content through expert consensus. 
- It allows experts to evaluate questionnaire items using linguistic terms (e.g. good, very good) rather than just numbers.
- A flexible consensus model is used to modify the questionnaire over multiple rounds until agreement is reached on all items.
- A web-based decision support system tool is provided to assist the moderator.

Main Contributions:
- A specific questionnaire to evaluate student satisfaction and communication in a blended learning environment using both flipped classroom and m-learning.
- A new method for linguistically validating questionnaires through expert consensus.
- An open source web-based tool to implement the fuzzy linguistic Delphi technique.
- Demonstration of the method by validating the proposed blended learning questionnaire with a panel of 9 experts over 2 rounds.
- The result is a validated 45-item questionnaire that can be used to evaluate combined flipped classroom and m-learning educational experiences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes a 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method and a web-based decision support system tool to validate the content of a questionnaire for evaluating student satisfaction with a blended learning experience combining flipped classroom and mobile learning, using expert consensus reached through multiple iterative assessments of questionnaire items on linguistic criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes a 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method to test the content validity of questionnaires, especially for evaluating b-learning educational experiences combining flipped classroom and m-learning methodologies. This allows handling ambiguity in expert opinions using linguistic terms. 

2. It develops a consensus process through multiple rounds to achieve agreement between expert evaluations on questionnaire items. This is modeled as a multi-expert multi-criteria linguistic decision making problem. 

3. It provides an online decision support system (DSS) tool to assist the consensus process, visualize collective opinions, and determine which parts of the questionnaire need modification.

4. It presents a case study applying the proposed method and DSS tool to validate a questionnaire on student satisfaction with a blended learning experience in higher education. After two rounds, a consensual version of the 45-item questionnaire was achieved.

In summary, the key contribution is a flexible fuzzy linguistic Delphi technique and supporting software to ensure questionnaire validity through expert consensus.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts discussed in this paper include:

- Blended learning (b-learning)
- Flipped classroom
- Mobile learning (m-learning) 
- Questionnaire validation 
- Content validity
- Delphi method
- Fuzzy Delphi method 
- 2-Tuple fuzzy linguistic model
- Computing with words 
- Multi-expert multi-criteria decision making
- Consensus reaching 
- Decision support system (DSS)

The paper proposes an extension of the Fuzzy Delphi method called the 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method to validate the content of a questionnaire to evaluate a blended learning experience combining flipped classroom and m-learning. It uses fuzzy linguistic modeling and computing with words to represent expert opinions and reach consensus. A DSS tool is also presented to assist the questionnaire validation process. The method is applied to a real blended learning experience in higher education.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method. What are the key benefits of using a linguistic approach compared to a classic numerical Delphi method? How does the 2-tuple representation allow for effective computations with words?

2. The method incorporates multi-granular linguistic term sets. Why is this useful when validating questionnaires that cover diverse constructs? How does the unification phase enable experts to choose different scales based on their expertise? 

3. The paper models the questionnaire validation process as a Multi-Expert Multi-Criteria Decision Making problem. What is the rationale behind this modeling approach? How does it allow calculation of consensus indices?

4. The method computes several linguistic scores per questionnaire item. What specific scores are calculated and how do they provide insights into the item's quality and consensus amongst experts? 

5. What consensus model is used in the 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method? How is a satisfactory reliance level incorporated into determining consensus? What role does the separation measure play?

6. How exactly is the multi-step aggregation process carried out when solving the decision problem for each item? What operators are used and what do they calculate at each step?

7. What are the practical benefits of developing a specialized DSS tool to implement this validation method? What key features does the 2-tuple-fuzzy-delphi tool provide?  

8. The method is applied to validate a questionnaire for a blended learning experience. What specific pedagogical approaches were combined? Why was expert consensus critical for this questionnaire?

9. What were the key outcomes in the two Delphi iterations for the case study? How was overall consensus achieved for the final questionnaire?

10. The paper mentions enhancing the DSS tool with additional capabilities. What extensions are proposed that could improve applicability and usability?
