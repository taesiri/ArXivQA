# [Recitation-Augmented Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01296)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question appears to be: How can recitation of relevant factual knowledge improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on closed-book question answering tasks, without needing to retrieve information from an external corpus?The key hypothesis seems to be:Introducing an intermediate recitation step, where the LLM recites relevant factual passages from its own memory before answering questions, will allow the LLM to better leverage and recall its internal knowledge. This recite-and-answer approach can improve accuracy on closed-book QA without external retrieval.Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates a recitation-augmented generation framework called RECITE, which has the LLM first sample and recite relevant passages from its memory before producing the final answer. The core hypothesis is that prompting the LLM to explicitly recite knowledge can help it generate more accurate factual responses for knowledge-intensive tasks like QA. The paper tests this recite-and-answer approach on several LLMs and QA datasets.In summary, the central research question is whether recitation of internal knowledge can improve closed-book QA accuracy for LLMs, and the key hypothesis is that an intermediate recitation step will allow better use of the LLM's internal knowledge, leading to more factually accurate QA without external retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new paradigm called RECITation-augmented gEneration (RECITE) to help large language models generate more accurate factual knowledge without retrieving from an external corpus. The key ideas are:- Introducing a recitation step before answering where the model recites relevant passages from its own memory to provide supporting evidence for the answer. This mimics how humans would first recite relevant facts before answering knowledge questions.- Showing that the recite-and-answer scheme is an effective method for closed-book QA and compatible with techniques like self-consistency and diversified recitation to improve performance.- Demonstrating through experiments on 4 large LMs and 3 QA datasets that recitation augmentation consistently improves QA accuracy across models and datasets compared to standard prompting baselines.So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating the recitation-augmented generation paradigm to enhance factual correctness of LMs for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks like QA without needing external retrieval.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new paradigm called recitation-augmented generation (RECITE) which improves the accuracy of large language models on closed-book question answering tasks by first reciting relevant passages from the model's own memory before producing the final answer.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of improving language model performance on closed-book question answering:- This paper introduces a new recitation-augmented generation (RECITE) framework for closed-book QA. Other related work has focused on retrieval-augmented generation for open-book QA, or chain-of-thought prompting for reasoning. RECITE provides a new way to elicit knowledge from the model's parameters.- The recite-and-answer scheme demonstrates strong empirical results on multiple models across diverse QA datasets. This shows the broad applicability and effectiveness of the approach. Other work has tended to focus evaluation on just one or two models/datasets. - The idea of using passage hints to diversify recitation and fine-tuning the model on generated question-passage pairs is novel. This goes beyond just prompting strategies to actually adapt the model.- The analysis provides useful insights into the factors impacting recitation quality and answer aggregation. This level of analysis is lacking in much prior work.- The limitations around knowledge freshness and cost of fine-tuning are honestly discussed. Most papers do not point out limitations of their proposed methods.- The prompts and code are released to facilitate reproducibility. Many prompt-based papers do not provide full prompts.Overall, I feel this paper makes solid contributions over related work by proposing a new prompting paradigm, conducting comprehensive experiments, and providing thoughtful analysis. The recitation idea seems generalizable to other knowledge-intensive tasks as well. Releasing the resources is also a plus for reproducibility. The limitations are clearly acknowledged too.
