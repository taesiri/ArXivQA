# [Generative agent-based modeling with actions grounded in physical,   social, or digital space using Concordia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03664)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Concordia, a python library for generative agent-based modeling that facilitates simulating interactions of agents grounded in physical, social, or digital spaces. Concordia agents behave by querying a large language model to decide actions based on their identity and situation, mediated by modular components representing different aspects of cognition. A Game Master handles the environment, translating agent actions and maintaining grounded variables. Concordia aims to implement social constructionist models where agents mutually constitute their social structures and meanings. It can integrate real apps and services through API calls to simulate human digital activity, generate synthetic user data, and evaluate AI systems. Validating Concordia models remains an open challenge, with possible approaches including measuring generalization, algorithmic fidelity in representing subpopulations, robustness checks, and consistency with theories. Overall, Concordia opens possibilities for agent-based modeling incorporating common sense and language, to investigate emergent cultural and institutional dynamics.
