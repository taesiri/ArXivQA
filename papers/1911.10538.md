# [Breaking the cycle -- Colleagues are all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10538)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can image-to-image translation be performed between unpaired domains without relying on cycle consistency constraints? The key hypothesis is that image translation can be improved by having multiple GANs collaborate with each other ("a council of GANs"), rather than enforcing cycle consistency constraints. The paper proposes that by having the GAN generators influence each other, they can reach better solutions that focus on the common traits between the domains.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a council of collaborating GANs can achieve high-quality image translation without cycle consistency, overcoming limitations of previous approaches. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on challenging image translation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach for unpaired image-to-image translation based on a "council" of GANs. The key ideas are:- Using a council of multiple GANs (each with a generator and discriminators) that influence each other's results instead of relying on cycle consistency constraints.- The generators in the council try to produce outputs that are mutually agreeable, which encourages them to focus on common traits between domains. - Avoiding cycle constraints allows removing large objects, not leaving traces of the input, and handling large shape changes.- The model can generate multiple diverse outputs for an input image.The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several challenging image translation tasks like glasses removal, selfies to anime, and male to female translation. The lack of cycle constraints allows completely removing glasses, better preserving face structure in anime translation, and generating more feminine faces from males. The collaborative council approach addresses limitations of previous GAN methods.
