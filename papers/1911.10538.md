# [Breaking the cycle -- Colleagues are all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10538)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can image-to-image translation be performed between unpaired domains without relying on cycle consistency constraints? The key hypothesis is that image translation can be improved by having multiple GANs collaborate with each other ("a council of GANs"), rather than enforcing cycle consistency constraints. The paper proposes that by having the GAN generators influence each other, they can reach better solutions that focus on the common traits between the domains.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a council of collaborating GANs can achieve high-quality image translation without cycle consistency, overcoming limitations of previous approaches. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on challenging image translation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach for unpaired image-to-image translation based on a "council" of GANs. The key ideas are:- Using a council of multiple GANs (each with a generator and discriminators) that influence each other's results instead of relying on cycle consistency constraints.- The generators in the council try to produce outputs that are mutually agreeable, which encourages them to focus on common traits between domains. - Avoiding cycle constraints allows removing large objects, not leaving traces of the input, and handling large shape changes.- The model can generate multiple diverse outputs for an input image.The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art results on several challenging image translation tasks like glasses removal, selfies to anime, and male to female translation. The lack of cycle constraints allows completely removing glasses, better preserving face structure in anime translation, and generating more feminine faces from males. The collaborative council approach addresses limitations of previous GAN methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach for unpaired image-to-image translation using a council of GANs that collaborate to generate diverse results without relying on cycle consistency constraints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in image-to-image translation and generative adversarial networks:- It proposes a novel "council GAN" architecture that relies on collaboration between multiple generator/discriminator pairs rather than a cycle consistency loss. This is a new approach compared to prior unsupervised image-to-image translation methods like CycleGAN, MUNIT, etc. that use cycle consistency losses.- The council GAN aims to generate diverse and multi-modal outputs for a given input image, while still maintaining key attributes from the input. This sets it apart from methods that generate a single output.- The paper demonstrates results on challenging tasks like glasses removal, anime generation, and male-to-female translation. It shows both qualitative and quantitative comparisons to prior state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them in many cases. This helps validate the usefulness of the council GAN. - The idea of using multiple generators and discriminators has been explored before in GAN literature, but the paper presents a novel loss function and training procedure for the council GAN to enable collaboration. The overall architecture and training approach are new.- The paper introduces the idea of using "focus maps" generated by the GAN to indicate areas of change. This could be useful for other applications as well and isn't explored much in other works.- There is some similarity conceptually to ensemble methods, but the paper points out that council GAN training encourages convergence rather than diversity of models. This differentiates it from standard ensembling.Overall, I would say the paper makes several novel contributions in terms of the council GAN architecture, loss functions, and applications in difficult image-to-image translation tasks. The comparisons to prior methods help situate the work and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing methods to handle feature imbalance in the datasets without changing the number of images. As noted in the limitations section, imbalances in the features present in the source and target domains can lead to unwanted changes in the translated images. The authors suggest addressing this by providing better balanced datasets, but propose exploring ways to handle the imbalance without modifying the datasets as an area for future work.- Exploring different council architectures and loss functions. The authors propose a specific implementation of the council GAN idea, but suggest exploring alternate architectures and losses as a direction for further improving performance. For example, they propose investigating different numbers of generators/discriminators per council member.- Applying the council GAN framework to other translation tasks. The method is demonstrated on only a few tasks in the paper, so the authors suggest exploring its application to other image-to-image translation problems as an area for future work.- Investigating methods to reduce the training time. The council GAN takes longer to train due to the multiple generators and extra discriminators. Reducing the training time through parallelization or other methods while maintaining accuracy is noted as an area for improvement.- Extending the idea of collaborative GANs to other GAN models and applications beyond translation. The key concept of using collaboration/consensus between networks rather than cycle consistency may have benefits for other types of GANs and problems. Exploring this is suggested as an interesting research direction.In summary, the main future directions focus on variations of the council GAN framework itself, applying it to new tasks, improving training efficiency, and extending the core collaborative ideas more broadly. The authors propose a range of ways to build on the council GAN model introduced in the paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel approach for unsupervised image-to-image translation called Council-GAN. Rather than relying on cycle consistency constraints like most prior work, the key idea is to use a "council" of multiple GANs that influence and learn from each other's results. Specifically, the model contains multiple generator-discriminator pairs. Each discriminator tries to distinguish its generator's outputs from those of the other generators. This forces the generators to produce results that have agreement, focusing on shared traits between domains. The model is applied to challenging tasks like glasses removal, selfie to anime translation, and male to female translation. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, overcoming limitations of previous methods. For example, the model can fully remove glasses without leaving traces, handle large shape changes for anime translation, and generate more feminine faces for male to female translation. A key benefit is the lack of cycle constraints, which often cause unwanted artifacts. The collaborative multi-GAN approach allows high quality translation without cycle consistency.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new approach for unsupervised image-to-image translation between unpaired domains. The key idea is to use a "council" of multiple GANs that collaborate with each other, rather than relying on cycle consistency constraints like most prior work. The council contains multiple generator/discriminator pairs. Each discriminator tries to distinguish between outputs of its own generator versus outputs of the other generators. This forces the generators to produce outputs that have common elements that the other generators would also produce. By replacing cycle consistency with this council approach, the model can better handle tasks like removing large objects from images, changing image styles significantly, and generating diverse outputs for the same input image. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on tasks like glasses removal, selfie to anime translation, and male to female translation. Both qualitative results and quantitative metrics show the advantages of using a council versus prior cycle consistency approaches. Overall, this collaborative council approach offers a new way to perform unpaired image-to-image translation with improved performance.
