## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can image-to-image translation be performed between unpaired domains without relying on cycle consistency constraints? The key hypothesis is that image translation can be improved by having multiple GANs collaborate with each other ("a council of GANs"), rather than enforcing cycle consistency constraints. The paper proposes that by having the GAN generators influence each other, they can reach better solutions that focus on the common traits between the domains.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a council of collaborating GANs can achieve high-quality image translation without cycle consistency, overcoming limitations of previous approaches. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on challenging image translation tasks.
