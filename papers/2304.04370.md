# OpenAGI: When LLM Meets Domain Experts

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can large language models (LLMs) be enhanced to harness various domain expert models for complex task-solving, as a promising approach towards artificial general intelligence (AGI)?The key hypothesis appears to be:By integrating large language models with domain-specific expert models, inspired by the blend of general and specialized intelligence in humans, it may be possible to develop systems with improved capabilities for complex task-solving across different domains, advancing progress towards AGI.Specifically, the paper proposes an open-source AGI research platform called OpenAGI that allows LLMs to select, synthesize and execute various external expert models (tools, APIs, modules etc.) in order to solve intricate, multi-step real-world tasks presented in natural language. The main innovations include:- A dual strategy with benchmark tasks for standardized evaluation and open-ended tasks for expandability.- A Reinforcement Learning from Task Feedback (RLTF) mechanism that uses task results to improve the LLM's planning and task-solving abilities over time.- Integrating models from repositories like HuggingFace and GitHub for extensibility.The central hypothesis seems to be that by equipping LLMs with the ability to harness specialized external models through this system, their capacity for complex task-solving can be enhanced, representing progress towards more general intelligence. The proposed OpenAGI platform aims to facilitate researching this hypothesis.
