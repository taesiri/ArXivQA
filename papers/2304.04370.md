## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my analysis of how this paper compares to other research in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI):

Overall, this paper introduces a novel open-source platform called OpenAGI for benchmarking and advancing AGI research. The key ideas presented include:

- Using a large language model (LLM) as a controller to select, synthesize and execute external expert models for complex task solving. This builds on prior work like WebGPT, ToolFormer, and HuggingGPT that also aim to augment LLMs with external tools/models. However, OpenAGI aims for more extensibility.

- Proposing a dual benchmark/open-ended task strategy. The benchmark tasks allow standardized evaluation, while open-ended tasks promote creativity. This provides a versatile platform.

- Demonstrating that smaller LLMs like Flan-T5 can outperform larger models like Vicuna when combined with RLTF, suggesting promise for efficient AGI development.

Compared to current leading AGI platforms:

- Anthropic's Claude focuses on safe, helpful AI lacking OpenAGI's emphasis on creative open-ended tasks. 

- Cohere's platform centers on large LLMs without model synthesis.

- Anthropic's Constitutional AI places greater weight on ethics/safety than benchmarking skills.

- platforms like AI Gym and Major League Robotics stress embodied AI over linguistic.

Overall, OpenAGI occupies a unique niche with its blend of benchmarking, open-ended tasks, model synthesis, and efficiency. If scaled up, it could become a valuable open platform for driving and measuring AGI progress. The code release and benchmarks are a step toward community adoption.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is introducing OpenAGI, an open-source AGI research platform designed to enable LLMs to solve complex, real-world tasks by synthesizing and executing various domain expert models. 

The key problem the paper is addressing is how to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) capabilities in LLMs to solve intricate real-world tasks that require specialized domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning. The authors identify three main challenges in existing work:

1) Limited extensibility of models/tools that can be used by the LLM. Many existing platforms have a fixed set of models, making it hard to expand capabilities.

2) Focus on linear task planning solutions. Most research is limited to sequential sub-task execution, whereas complex tasks may require nonlinear planning. 

3) Difficulty in quantification and benchmarking. Many existing systems only provide qualitative analysis, but quantifiable metrics are needed to properly evaluate planning abilities.

To address these limitations, the OpenAGI platform provides an open-source toolkit with expandable domain expert models, nonlinear task planning, quantitative benchmark tasks, and open-ended creative tasks to develop and evaluate LLMs for real-world AGI abilities. The proposed LLM+RLTF approach uses reinforcement learning from task feedback to improve the LLM's planning strategies.

In summary, the key problem is developing real-world AGI capabilities in LLMs by synthesizing specialized skills, and OpenAGI provides an open platform to make progress on this challenge. The paper focuses on extensible model integration, nonlinear planning, and quantitative evaluation as the main areas needing improvement in existing research.
