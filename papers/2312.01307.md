# [SAGE: Bridging Semantic and Actionable Parts for GEneralizable   Articulated-Object Manipulation under Language Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01307)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generalizable manipulation of articulated objects remains challenging in real-world scenarios with diverse object structures and complex natural language goals. Previous methods lack the ability to comprehend both the physical affordances of object parts and the cognitive affordances of object functionalities.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel framework called SAGE that bridges physical and cognitive affordances at the part level to enable better comprehension and interaction for articulated object manipulation under language instructions. 

It has two main components:
1) A context-aware instruction interpreter that combines a large visual-language model (VLM) and a small perception network to generate rich and accurate scene descriptions, which are then parsed by a large language model (LLM) to output programmatic part-level action units represented as (part name, joint type, state change).

2) A part manipulation generator that turns the action units into executable manipulation policies using implicit PDF to handle multi-ground truth outputs. It leverages NOCS features from images to predict policies with cross-category generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework integrating language instructions and physical interactions via part-level affordance bridging 
- Context-aware instruction interpreter with coherent VLM and LLM
- Part manipulation generator with implicit PDF policies and cross-category generalizability
- New benchmark with more realistic and diverse articulated object manipulation tasks

The experiments will demonstrate SAGE's effectiveness for language-guided articulated object manipulation and its ability to generalize across object categories and tasks.
