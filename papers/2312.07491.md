# [On Robot Acceptance and Trust: A Review and Unanswered Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07491)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-quality summary paragraph for the paper:

This paper provides an overview of considerations around robot acceptance and trust, focusing specifically on interactive and social robots. It discusses the potential benefits of robot acceptance, like improved quality of life, solutions to social problems, more efficient communication, and empowerment of people. However, acceptance also has drawbacks in potentially reducing quality of life from poor design, increasing inequalities, reinforcing biases, and displacing jobs. Similarly, appropriate trust in robots can increase efficiency, confidence, and market success, while misplaced trust can reduce performance and security and be hard to repair once lost. Core unanswered questions around robot acceptance and trust include achieving reliability and safety, integrating ethical decision-making, providing explainability of behaviors, handling privacy issues, and designing interactions that foster accurate communication and trust. More philosophically, the lack of clear definitions and metrics for trust leads to questioning whether we actually understand the multifaceted phenomenon of trust in human-robot interaction and if only achieving some facets of trust is sufficient. Overall, many open questions around acceptance and trust must still be explored as robot designs and applications continue advancing.
