# [Parameter is Not All You Need: Starting from Non-Parametric Networks for   3D Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08134)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is whether high performing 3D point cloud analysis can be achieved with non-parametric components, without any learnable parameters or training. The key hypothesis is that the basic non-parametric operations commonly used in 3D networks, such as farthest point sampling, k-nearest neighbors, and pooling, along with simple trigonometric functions, are sufficient for effective 3D understanding.  The paper proposes a non-parametric network called Point-NN that is constructed solely from these basic non-learnable building blocks. The results show Point-NN can surpass fully trained models on tasks like classification, demonstrating the potential of non-parametric methods. The paper then explores two promising applications of Point-NN: as an architectural framework to build efficient parametric networks, and as a plug-and-play module to enhance existing 3D models without retraining. Overall, the central research question is re-evaluating if we can move beyond heavily parametric models by starting from non-parametric components for 3D point cloud analysis.

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Point-NN, a novel non-parametric network for 3D point cloud analysis. Point-NN is constructed purely using non-learnable components like farthest point sampling, k-nearest neighbors, pooling operations, and trigonometric functions, without any trainable parameters or learning.2. Surprisingly, Point-NN achieves favorable performance on various 3D tasks like shape classification, part segmentation, and 3D object detection, even outperforming some existing fully-trained models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the non-parametric components. 3. Based on Point-NN, the paper introduces two extensions:- Point-PN: By inserting a few linear layers into Point-NN, a parametric network Point-PN is derived, which achieves high performance with very few trainable parameters and without complicated operators.- Plug-and-play module: Point-NN can be used to enhance existing trained 3D models during inference by fusing predictions, without retraining. It provides complementary geometric knowledge to boost performance.4. Through Point-NN and its applications, the paper shows the potentials of non-parametric methods and rethinks 3D point cloud analysis from a new perspective of starting from non-parametric components.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Point-NN, a novel non-parametric network for 3D point clouds, and demonstrating its effectiveness and extensions for parametric networks and inference enhancement. The paper provides a new direction to understand 3D point clouds with non-parametric approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes Point-NN, a non-parametric network for 3D point cloud analysis constructed using basic components like FPS, k-NN, and pooling, without any training or parameters; it shows Point-NN performs well on tasks like classification, segmentation, and detection, and presents two extensions using it as an architectural framework for parametric networks or a plug-and-play module to enhance existing models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on non-parametric networks for 3D point cloud analysis:- This is the first paper to propose a pure non-parametric network (Point-NN) for 3D point cloud analysis. It shows favorable performance on various 3D tasks using only basic non-learnable components like FPS, k-NN, and pooling, without any trained parameters. This is a novel contribution compared to prior works that rely on learned features and parameters.- The paper introduces two promising applications starting from Point-NN: 1) As a framework to build parametric networks (Point-PN) by simply inserting a few linear layers, achieving high efficiency. 2) As a plug-and-play module to enhance existing trained 3D models without re-training. These applications effectively combine non-parametric and parametric approaches.- Most prior 3D networks focus on designing advanced learnable modules like convolutions, attention, etc. This paper takes a different approach by optimizing the non-parametric components, which is largely overlooked before. It shows strong results can be achieved from a simple non-parametric base, without complex learned operators.- For encoding local geometry, Point-NN uses non-parametric trigonometric functions rather than learned relations. It shows trigonometric functions are effective for capturing high-frequency structures and relative positions. This provides a new perspective compared to prior learned approaches.- Point-NN also proposes novel designs like point-memory bank for similarity matching, which surpasses existing models in low-data regimes. This offers a different angle to tackle few-shot 3D recognition compared to meta-learning approaches.Overall, this paper makes multiple novel contributions by revisiting non-parametric techniques for 3D point clouds. It demonstrates very competitive performance to state-of-the-art parametric networks, offering new insights and directions for this research field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more advanced non-parametric models for 3D point cloud analysis. The authors propose Point-NN as a first step towards purely non-parametric 3D processing, but suggest exploring more sophisticated non-parametric architectures in the future. - Investigating how to better integrate non-parametric and parametric components in hybrid models. The authors show how Point-NN can serve as a framework for parametric networks like Point-PN, but more work can be done on optimally combining non-learnable and learnable modules.- Applying Point-NN and similar non-parametric networks to more 3D tasks and scenarios. The authors demonstrate Point-NN on classification, segmentation and detection, but it could potentially benefit other problems like 3D reconstruction, registration, upsampling etc.- Exploring non-parametric networks for other 3D input representations beyond point clouds. The authors focus on point clouds, but future work could try applying similar ideas to voxel, mesh, or multi-view data.- Studying how non-parametric networks could enable better model generalization, transfer learning, and few-shot performance on 3D data. The strong few-shot results indicate this is a promising direction.- Developing specialized non-parametric components like raw point embedding and geometry extraction for 3D deep learning. The trigonometric functions used in Point-NN are an initial attempt but more advanced versions could be designed.- Understanding the theory behind why non-parametric building blocks are effective for 3D learning. Formal analysis is missing on the properties that make Point-NN successful.- Exploring how ideas from Point-NN could transfer to non-Euclidean data like graphs or manifolds. The techniques may generalize beyond 3D point cloud processing.In summary, the authors lay out an extensive research agenda for building on Point-NN to develop more advanced non-parametric and hybrid networks for 3D point cloud analysis and beyond. There are many open problems left to explore in this interesting direction.
