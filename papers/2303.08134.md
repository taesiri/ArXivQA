# [Parameter is Not All You Need: Starting from Non-Parametric Networks for   3D Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08134)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is whether high performing 3D point cloud analysis can be achieved with non-parametric components, without any learnable parameters or training. The key hypothesis is that the basic non-parametric operations commonly used in 3D networks, such as farthest point sampling, k-nearest neighbors, and pooling, along with simple trigonometric functions, are sufficient for effective 3D understanding.  The paper proposes a non-parametric network called Point-NN that is constructed solely from these basic non-learnable building blocks. The results show Point-NN can surpass fully trained models on tasks like classification, demonstrating the potential of non-parametric methods. The paper then explores two promising applications of Point-NN: as an architectural framework to build efficient parametric networks, and as a plug-and-play module to enhance existing 3D models without retraining. Overall, the central research question is re-evaluating if we can move beyond heavily parametric models by starting from non-parametric components for 3D point cloud analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes Point-NN, a novel non-parametric network for 3D point cloud analysis. Point-NN is constructed purely using non-learnable components like farthest point sampling, k-nearest neighbors, pooling operations, and trigonometric functions, without any trainable parameters or learning.2. Surprisingly, Point-NN achieves favorable performance on various 3D tasks like shape classification, part segmentation, and 3D object detection, even outperforming some existing fully-trained models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the non-parametric components. 3. Based on Point-NN, the paper introduces two extensions:- Point-PN: By inserting a few linear layers into Point-NN, a parametric network Point-PN is derived, which achieves high performance with very few trainable parameters and without complicated operators.- Plug-and-play module: Point-NN can be used to enhance existing trained 3D models during inference by fusing predictions, without retraining. It provides complementary geometric knowledge to boost performance.4. Through Point-NN and its applications, the paper shows the potentials of non-parametric methods and rethinks 3D point cloud analysis from a new perspective of starting from non-parametric components.In summary, the key contribution is proposing Point-NN, a novel non-parametric network for 3D point clouds, and demonstrating its effectiveness and extensions for parametric networks and inference enhancement. The paper provides a new direction to understand 3D point clouds with non-parametric approaches.
