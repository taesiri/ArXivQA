# [PartNeRF: Generating Part-Aware Editable 3D Shapes without 3D   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09554)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a generative model for editable 3D shapes that does not require explicit 3D supervision and enables part-level control during generation?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shapes. 

- Unlike prior works, PartNeRF does not require explicit 3D supervision (e.g. 3D meshes) during training. It is trained from 2D images and masks.

- PartNeRF represents objects using locally defined NeRFs as parts. This allows part-level control during generation and editing by applying transformations to individual part NeRFs.

- A key contribution is introducing a hard assignment between rays and object parts. This ensures that changing one part does not affect others. 

- Experiments on ShapeNet categories demonstrate PartNeRF's ability to generate and edit shapes with higher fidelity than prior generative models using NeRFs or primitives.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a part-aware generative model for 3D shapes that enables intuitive editing without 3D supervision. PartNeRF aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis that does not require explicit 3D supervision. The key points are:

- Represents objects using a set of locally defined Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) arranged to render the object from novel views. 

- Enforces a hard assignment between rays and parts, so altering one part does not affect others.

- Trained from images and masks only, no 3D data needed.

- Enables various editing operations like part transformations, mixing, adding/removing, and appearance editing.

- Evaluated on ShapeNet categories, generates editable shapes of higher fidelity than prior methods needing 3D supervision or only using NeRFs.

So in summary, the main contribution is a generative model that can synthesize high quality editable 3D shapes with part-level control, without needing any 3D supervision like meshes or point clouds during training. This opens up new applications in 3D content creation and editing.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis from 2D supervision that represents objects as a structured set of local NeRFs and enables various part-level editing operations on both shape and texture without requiring 3D labels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in generative modelling of 3D shapes:

- It proposes the first part-aware generative model that represents parts using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Other part-based generative works like SPAGHETTI and DualSDF use simple primitives like spheres or superquadrics to represent parts. Using NeRFs allows modeling more complex part geometries.

- Unlike most prior part-based generative models, this method does not require 3D supervision like meshes or voxel grids. It is trained from 2D images and masks, making it more widely applicable.

- It demonstrates both shape and appearance/texture editing capabilities by disentangling part geometry and appearance. Other part-based models are limited to shape editing only.

- Compared to NeRF-GAN models like GRAF and Pi-GAN, this approach enables intuitive part-level editing that is not possible in those holistic NeRF models.

- The hard ray-part assignment is a key difference from scene-based NeRF composition models like NSVF. It ensures edits to one part don't affect others.

- It shows strong quantitative shape generation results compared to part-supervised models, despite using only 2D supervision. The textures are less detailed than recent models using adversarial losses or tri-planes.

- It does not ensure semantic consistency of parts like some primitive-based models. The parts don't always correspond to human-interpretable components.

Overall, this paper makes significant advances in part-aware generative modeling and editing of 3D shapes from 2D data. The NeRF-based part representation and editing capabilities are novel. But limitations like less detailed textures and lack of part interpretability suggest avenues for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporating more complex shape representations like triplanes or differentiable rendering techniques to improve the quality and resolution of generated textures. The current model produces decent but still somewhat blurry/simplistic textures.

- Extending the model to moving/deformable objects instead of just static shapes. This would expand the range of editable content the model can generate.

- Removing the need for object masks during training. Currently the model requires posed images + masks for supervision, but acquiring detailed masks can be difficult for objects in the wild. Exploring ways to train only from images could improve applicability.

- Adding support for more complex deformation-based editing operations like neural cages or biharmonic coordinates. This could enable mesh deformations beyond just rigid/affine part transformations.

- Enforcing more semantic consistency and interpretability of the learned parts. The current parts are not guaranteed to match human-identifiable components. Building in constraints or losses to get more meaningful parts could improve editability.

- Incorporating adversarial training or other generative modeling techniques to improve overall image/shape quality. The current model does not use GANs or similar methods.

- Extending the approach to unposed training images, not just posed/aligned imagery. This could further increase the flexibility of the training data.

- Developing ways to synthesize logical part connections after moving/modifying parts, instead of just having disjoint regions.

Overall the authors point to many interesting ways to build on this work to expand its capabilities and applicability in future 3D generative modeling and editing research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model that represents 3D objects as a structured set of locally defined Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). The model takes as input a set of images and masks of an object captured from known viewpoints. Each object is decomposed into a number of parts, with each part defined by its own NeRF representation consisting of a shape code, texture code, pose parameters, and scale. The parts are rendered independently using volumetric rendering and composed together using a hard assignment between rays and parts that ensures each ray is colored by only one part's NeRF. This allows part-level control during generation and editing by manipulating the per-part codes and parameters. The model is trained end-to-end from images and masks without 3D supervision. Experiments demonstrate its ability to generate and edit shapes with higher fidelity compared to baselines, enabling operations like part mixing and transformation not possible with other generative NeRF models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis without requiring explicit 3D supervision. The key idea is to represent objects using a set of locally defined Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) that are arranged to render the object plausibly from novel views. To enable part-level control, the model enforces a hard assignment between rays and parts, so that the color of each ray is predicted from a single NeRF. This ensures that altering one part does not affect the appearance of others. The model is trained from images and object masks captured from known cameras, without needing 3D data. It consists of three main components: a decomposition network that maps object-specific shape and texture embeddings to per-part latent codes, a structure network that outputs pose and scale for each part, and a rendering module with per-part NeRFs. Experiments on ShapeNet categories show the model can generate editable shapes of higher fidelity than prior part-based methods needing 3D supervision or NeRF models, and enables various editing operations like part transformations, mixing, adding/removing, and appearance editing.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) The first part-aware generative model representing parts as NeRFs, enabling part-level control for editing operations not possible before. 2) Unlike prior part-based generative models, it doesn't require explicit 3D supervision, using only images and masks. 3) Evaluations demonstrate improved generation quality over previous part-based and NeRF methods, and showcase editing operations on shape and texture. The model represents an important advance towards generating high-quality editable 3D content without 3D data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis that does not require explicit 3D supervision. Objects are represented using a structured set of locally defined Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) that are trained from posed images and object masks. Each NeRF is augmented with an affine transformation to enable control in a local coordinate frame. A hard assignment between rays and parts is enforced, so that the color of each ray is predicted from a single NeRF. This ensures that modifying one part does not affect the others. The generative model is implemented as an auto-decoder that takes as input latent shape and texture codes and maps them to per-part codes using transformer encoders. Experiments on ShapeNet categories demonstrate the ability to perform various editing operations on both the shape and texture of generated objects.
