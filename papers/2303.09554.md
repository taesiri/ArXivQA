# [PartNeRF: Generating Part-Aware Editable 3D Shapes without 3D   Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09554)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop a generative model for editable 3D shapes that does not require explicit 3D supervision and enables part-level control during generation?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shapes. 

- Unlike prior works, PartNeRF does not require explicit 3D supervision (e.g. 3D meshes) during training. It is trained from 2D images and masks.

- PartNeRF represents objects using locally defined NeRFs as parts. This allows part-level control during generation and editing by applying transformations to individual part NeRFs.

- A key contribution is introducing a hard assignment between rays and object parts. This ensures that changing one part does not affect others. 

- Experiments on ShapeNet categories demonstrate PartNeRF's ability to generate and edit shapes with higher fidelity than prior generative models using NeRFs or primitives.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop a part-aware generative model for 3D shapes that enables intuitive editing without 3D supervision. PartNeRF aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis that does not require explicit 3D supervision. The key points are:

- Represents objects using a set of locally defined Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) arranged to render the object from novel views. 

- Enforces a hard assignment between rays and parts, so altering one part does not affect others.

- Trained from images and masks only, no 3D data needed.

- Enables various editing operations like part transformations, mixing, adding/removing, and appearance editing.

- Evaluated on ShapeNet categories, generates editable shapes of higher fidelity than prior methods needing 3D supervision or only using NeRFs.

So in summary, the main contribution is a generative model that can synthesize high quality editable 3D shapes with part-level control, without needing any 3D supervision like meshes or point clouds during training. This opens up new applications in 3D content creation and editing.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes PartNeRF, a novel part-aware generative model for editable 3D shape synthesis from 2D supervision that represents objects as a structured set of local NeRFs and enables various part-level editing operations on both shape and texture without requiring 3D labels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in generative modelling of 3D shapes:

- It proposes the first part-aware generative model that represents parts using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Other part-based generative works like SPAGHETTI and DualSDF use simple primitives like spheres or superquadrics to represent parts. Using NeRFs allows modeling more complex part geometries.

- Unlike most prior part-based generative models, this method does not require 3D supervision like meshes or voxel grids. It is trained from 2D images and masks, making it more widely applicable.

- It demonstrates both shape and appearance/texture editing capabilities by disentangling part geometry and appearance. Other part-based models are limited to shape editing only.

- Compared to NeRF-GAN models like GRAF and Pi-GAN, this approach enables intuitive part-level editing that is not possible in those holistic NeRF models.

- The hard ray-part assignment is a key difference from scene-based NeRF composition models like NSVF. It ensures edits to one part don't affect others.

- It shows strong quantitative shape generation results compared to part-supervised models, despite using only 2D supervision. The textures are less detailed than recent models using adversarial losses or tri-planes.

- It does not ensure semantic consistency of parts like some primitive-based models. The parts don't always correspond to human-interpretable components.

Overall, this paper makes significant advances in part-aware generative modeling and editing of 3D shapes from 2D data. The NeRF-based part representation and editing capabilities are novel. But limitations like less detailed textures and lack of part interpretability suggest avenues for future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Incorporating more complex shape representations like triplanes or differentiable rendering techniques to improve the quality and resolution of generated textures. The current model produces decent but still somewhat blurry/simplistic textures.

- Extending the model to moving/deformable objects instead of just static shapes. This would expand the range of editable content the model can generate.

- Removing the need for object masks during training. Currently the model requires posed images + masks for supervision, but acquiring detailed masks can be difficult for objects in the wild. Exploring ways to train only from images could improve applicability.

- Adding support for more complex deformation-based editing operations like neural cages or biharmonic coordinates. This could enable mesh deformations beyond just rigid/affine part transformations.

- Enforcing more semantic consistency and interpretability of the learned parts. The current parts are not guaranteed to match human-identifiable components. Building in constraints or losses to get more meaningful parts could improve editability.

- Incorporating adversarial training or other generative modeling techniques to improve overall image/shape quality. The current model does not use GANs or similar methods.

- Extending the approach to unposed training images, not just posed/aligned imagery. This could further increase the flexibility of the training data.

- Developing ways to synthesize logical part connections after moving/modifying parts, instead of just having disjoint regions.

Overall the authors point to many interesting ways to build on this work to expand its capabilities and applicability in future 3D generative modeling and editing research.
