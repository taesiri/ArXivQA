## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper tries to address is how to train extremely deep convolutional neural networks (with over 100 layers) from scratch without using residual/shortcut connections. The key hypotheses are:1) Maintaining approximate orthogonality between filters in convolutional layers can help mitigate gradient vanishing/exploding during backpropagation and improve training of very deep plain networks.2) Modulating the magnitudes of backpropagated errors between layers based on second-order moment statistics can further stabilize training. Together, enforcing orthogonality constraints and error signal modulation allow successful end-to-end training of plain networks with over 100 layers, achieving comparable performance to residual networks.In summary, the paper explores new techniques like orthonormal regularization and error modulation to enable training of very deep feedforward CNNs, providing an alternative to shortcut connections for dealing with optimization difficulties in extreme network depth.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a method to train extremely deep plain convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without skip connections using orthonormality and modulation. 2. It introduces an orthonormal regularizer to replace traditional weight decay regularization to keep the filters in each layer as orthogonal as possible during training. This helps propagate signals stably in the backward pass.3. It designs a backward error modulation mechanism based on the quasi-isometry assumption between consecutive layers. This helps maintain the magnitude of errors during backpropagation to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients. 4. Experiments show the proposed methods can train a 110-layer plain CNN from scratch and achieve 81.6% accuracy on CIFAR-10, outperforming other optimization methods. 5. With the proposed techniques, plain CNNs can match or exceed the performance of residual networks of similar depth on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.6. The paper provides insights into understanding the training dynamics and degradation problem in optimizing extremely deep plain CNNs. The orthonormality and modulation principles are shown to be effective in alleviating this problem.In summary, the key contribution is proposing orthogonal regularization and error modulation techniques to enable stable training of very deep plain CNNs without skip connections, which has been difficult previously. The paper offers useful insights into deep network optimization.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes methods for training very deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without using shortcut connections like residual networks. The key ideas are:- Using batch normalization to stabilize forward propagation of signals.- Encouraging orthogonality between filters in each convolutional layer to help prevent vanishing/exploding gradients during backpropagation. - Modulating the magnitude of backpropagated errors between layers to maintain similar magnitudes throughout the network.The main contribution is showing these techniques can train plain CNNs with over 100 layers, closing the gap with residual networks.

This paper tackles much deeper networks.- Residual networks allow training of very deep CNNs by using shortcut connections to bypass layers. This work trains very deep plain networks without shortcuts.- Other techniques like highway networks also allow training deep plain CNNs but are not as widely used as ResNet. This provides an alternative approach.- It provides more comprehensive analysis about why deep networks are hard to train, in terms of signal propagation in both forward and backward passes.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to understanding the training dynamics in very deep CNNs.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Further explore strategies to compensate for the loss of orthonormality as learning progresses. The authors believe that if they can find ways to maintain orthonormality throughout training, it may enable training even deeper plain networks.- Understand more comprehensively the insights behind signal modulation, reparameterization and novel constraints to enable training of genuinely deep networks. The modulation mechanism proposed in this paper is a first step, but more work is needed to fully solve the degradation problem.- Design thinner network architectures to allow orthonormality to be more effective. The experiments showed orthonormality was less effective when there were many redundant channels, so designing architectures with fewer channels may help.- Investigate when and how to apply modulation during training. The timing and method of modulation is key to fully solving the degradation problem.- Explore other potential benefits of orthonormality regularization, such as its effects on model generalization.- Study how to extend the ideas to recurrent neural networks and other architectures beyond convolutional neural networks.In summary, the key future directions are gaining a deeper understanding of the theory behind training deep networks, developing better techniques for maintaining preferred conditions like orthonormality during training, and exploring how these ideas can be generalized to other network architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes new methods of orthonormal regularization and error signal modulation to improve training of extremely deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without shortcut connections. The orthonormal regularization helps keep the magnitude of backpropagated errors from vanishing or exploding. The error signal modulation dynamically adjusts the scale of errors in each layer to maintain quasi-isometry between layers. Experiments show these methods allow successful training of plain networks up to 110 layers on CIFAR-10 and 44 layers on ImageNet, outperforming other optimization techniques. The orthonormal regularization also provides gains when applied to residual networks.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes methods to train extremely deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without shortcut connections. The authors identify two key issues that make training very deep plain CNNs difficult: 1) The magnitude of backpropagated errors decays as it passes through layers, leading to vanishing gradients. 2) Nonlinearities like batch normalization distort the distribution of error signals as they propagate backwards. To address these issues, the authors propose using orthonormal regularization of weights to help maintain the magnitude of backpropagated errors. They also propose a dynamic error modulation mechanism to rescale error signals based on the ratio of variances between adjacent layers. Together, these methods allow successful training of plain CNNs with over 100 layers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show their approach matches or exceeds the performance of residual networks of similar depth. The authors argue their work provides insights into the degradation problem in deep networks and could enable training of very deep plain CNN architectures.
