# [MUSTARD: Mastering Uniform Synthesis of Theorem and Proof Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical reasoning and theorem proving require strict multi-step inference, making them appealing tasks for evaluating reasoning skills of large language models (LLMs). 
- However, high-quality step-wise annotations are hard to obtain at scale. Prior work has limitations in data quality, scale, or meaningfulness.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes MUSTARD, a framework to generate high-quality mathematical data at scale. 
- It combines the strengths of LLMs at verbalizing problems and solutions with formal theorem provers that validate solutions.
- The key stages are: sample mathematical concepts, use LLM to generate problems and solutions, validate solutions using a theorem prover like Lean, revise invalid solutions using error feedback.

Main Contributions:
- Releases MUSTARDSAUCE, a dataset with 5,866 problems spanning school to undergraduate levels. Each has an informal statement, informal proof, and validated formal proof.
- Analysis shows the data is high-quality, diverse, and effective for improving LLM performance on math word problems and theorem proving.
- Achieves strong improvements from fine-tuning smaller LLMs on MUSTARDSAUCE. E.g. 15.4% average relative gain by Llama 2-7B on automated theorem proving.

In summary, the paper provides an effective framework to generate large-scale, validated mathematical reasoning data. The released benchmark helps advance LLM reasoning abilities. The analysis quantifies the high quality and downstream utility of this synthesized data.
