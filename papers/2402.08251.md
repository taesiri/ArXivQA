# [Object Detection in Thermal Images Using Deep Learning for Unmanned   Aerial Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of detecting small objects in thermal images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Thermal images have advantages for UAV applications such as being able to detect objects at night, but they also come with challenges like low resolution, uneven thermal background, and high noise. Existing object detection methods using deep learning have limitations when applied to thermal UAV images containing small objects.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new neural network model specialized for detecting small objects in UAV thermal imagery. The model has three main components - backbone, neck and head. The backbone is based on YOLOv5 but optimized using techniques like Ghost convolution to reduce parameters. A transformer encoder is added to the backbone to enrich features. The neck uses a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (Bi-FPN) combined with sliding window attention layers to focus on high-value regions. The prediction head detects objects by evaluating the feature maps.  

Main Contributions:

- Analyzes the problem characteristics and studies recent detection methods for thermal images to design an optimized model

- Improves backbone with fewer parameters for UAV deployment. Also compresses model to ONNX and TensorRT for faster execution.

- Uses attention layers instead of just increasing network depth, reducing computation cost.

- Applies Bi-FPN for feedforward computation targeting high-value areas.

- Achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods on public dataset and custom UAV dataset with small objects.

- Real-time performance demonstrated on embedded computer Jetson AGX with over 90% stability.

The model has potential for practical UAV applications needing real-time onboard thermal imagery processing.
