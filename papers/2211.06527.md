# [Rewards Encoding Environment Dynamics Improves Preference-based   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06527)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) relies on having a good reward function to train effective policies. However, specifying a good reward function by hand can be challenging and can lead to undesired behavior if not done properly. Preference-based reward learning aims to overcome this by learning the reward function from human preference feedback over pairs/sets of trajectories, but current approaches require a large amount of preference labels (500+ pairs). This makes it difficult to apply these methods to real-world problems.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes enhancing the state-of-the-art preference learning algorithm PEBBLE by incorporating a self-supervised objective called self-future consistency (SFC) into the reward function representation. Specifically:

- SFC trains a state-action encoder via next-state prediction on unlabeled environment transitions stored in the replay buffer. This enables the reward function to leverage much more data beyond just the labeled preferences.

- The state-action encoder is periodically updated via SFC and then used as the backbone of the preference learning reward network. This focuses the reward network on determining rewards rather than environment dynamics.

- Experiments compare PEBBLE, PEBBLE+SFC (proposed), and ablations on 4 environments, varying amounts of feedback, query strategies, etc.

Main Contributions:

- Integrates self-supervised next-state prediction (SFC) into preference-based reward learning to improve sample efficiency.

- Demonstrates PEBBLE+SFC matches the performance of PEBBLE with 2x less feedback on 2 environments, especially benefiting smaller amounts of feedback.

- Analysis shows encoding environment dynamics is most beneficial with smaller feedback amounts and noisy/incorrect labels.

- Proposed approach reduces the sample complexity of current preference learning methods, making them more practical for real applications.

In summary, the paper enhances preference-based reward learning by using self-supervision to separate learning environment dynamics from learning rewards. This improves sample efficiency and policy performance compared to prior state-of-the-art.
