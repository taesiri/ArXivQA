# [NeuRes: Learning Proofs of Propositional Satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a fundamental NP-complete problem in computer science. While SAT solvers are widely used in domains like software verification, they can have bugs and their unsatisfiability proofs are often large and expensive to validate. Prior neural SAT solvers like NeuroSAT only make predictions without generating easy-to-validate certificates, limiting their usefulness where soundness is critical.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces NeuRes, a neuro-symbolic SAT solver that generates resolution proofs to certify both satisfiability and unsatisfiability verdicts. The key idea is to combine pointer networks with a dynamic graph representation of SAT formulas to select compatible clause pairs for resolution. NeuRes has two parallel tracks: (1) generating resolution proofs, and (2) decoding satisfying assignments. The tracks share a representation and collaborate - resolutions inject information to guide the assignment decoder, while finding a satisfying assignment proves satisfiability. 

Contributions:
1) Three pointer network architectures for selecting clause pairs from a dynamic graph to generate sound resolution proofs.
2) A resolution-aided SAT decoder that outperforms NeuroSAT by a wide margin while requiring far less training data.
3) A bootstrapping method to shorten training proofs, reducing proof lengths by 23% and boosting solver performance.  

In summary, NeuRes advances SAT solving through interpretable, easy-to-validate proofs while showing strong performance. The bootstrapping method also addresses the problem of large proof sizes in certifying traditional solvers. As the first provably sound neural SAT solver, NeuRes points to future work on combining learning and reasoning for trustworthy neuro-symbolic systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 NeuRes is a neuro-symbolic SAT solver that generates resolution proofs and truth assignments to certify the (un)satisfiability of propositional logic formulas.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing three novel architectures for generating resolution proofs for CNF formulas (Section 3) and demonstrating their ability to generalize from a small set of teacher proofs (Section 4.1). 

2. Studying the model's ability to shorten teacher proofs and devising a bootstrapped training procedure where the model progressively supplants the teacher proofs with much shorter versions (Section 4.3). This optimizes storage consumption of proofs and boosts overall performance.

3. Devising a resolution-aided SAT solver trained on teacher assignments and proofs, showing it outperforms the NeuroSAT baseline by a wide margin while requiring far less training samples (Section 5).

In summary, the main contribution is presenting NeuRes, the first neuro-symbolic SAT solver that is capable of proving unsatisfiability by generating resolution proofs, unlike other neural SAT solvers that only make predictions. NeuRes also shows superior performance and data efficiency compared to prior art.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a novel architecture that combines elements of Graph Neural Networks and Pointer Networks. Can you explain in more detail how these two types of networks are integrated and how they enable the key functionality of clause pair selection?

2) Resolution proofs require selecting compatible pairs of clauses from a dynamically growing set of clauses. How does the proposed architecture handle this more complex form of pointer selection compared to standard pointer networks that select from a static set?

3) The paper argues that resolution proof generation and SAT assignment finding can mutually benefit each other when done in parallel. Can you elaborate on what specific benefits each process provides to the other?

4) What modifications were made to the NeuroSAT architecture to enable dynamic updating of clause embeddings as new clauses are derived? How does this help improve performance over a static embedding scheme?

5) Explain the bootstrapped training procedure in more detail. How does having the model shorten its own training proofs provide advantages over regular teacher-forcing?

6) The anchored attention mechanism uses variable selection to reduce the complexity of clause pair selection. What property of resolution proofs does it exploit to guarantee connectivity of the attention grid under static embeddings?  

7) How does the adaptive message passing protocol that performs |V|+1 rounds help improve performance over fixed round protocols? Why is performing too many rounds detrimental?

8) The paper shows the model can generalize to larger problem sizes than seen during training. What modification was made to enable better scaling? Why does it help?

9) What are the limitations of resolution proofs compared to other forms of unsatisfiability certificates? How does the model address these?

10) The model performance is not yet competitive with industrial solvers. What potential integration strategies could help close this gap and mutually advance both neural and classical SAT solving techniques?
