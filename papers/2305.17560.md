# [Scalable Transformer for PDE Surrogate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17560)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we design a Transformer model for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) that is more scalable and stable compared to using standard softmax-free attention?The key ideas/contributions in addressing this research question appear to be:- Proposing a factorized attention mechanism based on an axial factorization of the kernel integral, instead of applying attention directly on the full grid like standard Transformer models. - Introducing a learnable projection operator that decomposes the high-dimensional input function into a set of 1D sub-functions. These are then used to compute the factorized kernel efficiently.- Showcasing the improved scalability of the proposed FactFormer model by applying it to simulate 2D Kolmogorov flow on a 256x256 grid and 3D smoke buoyancy on a 64x64x64 grid.- Comparing against standard softmax-free attention and showing the factorized attention results in more compact spectrum for the attention matrices, indicating higher efficiency.- Adopting training techniques like latent marching and pushforward to improve stability for time-dependent PDE problems.Overall, the key hypothesis seems to be that factorizing the attention can help improve the scalability and stability of Transformer for large-scale surrogate modeling of PDE systems, which the paper aims to validate through model design, experiments and comparison.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a scalable Transformer model called Factorized Transformer (FactFormer) for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). The main contributions are:1. It proposes a factorized attention mechanism that computes attention in an axial fashion using learnable projection operators and axial kernel functions. This reduces the computational complexity compared to standard full attention and improves scalability to high-dimensional problems. 2. It interprets attention as a learnable kernel integral and shows the proposed factorized attention corresponds to a factorized kernel scheme. 3. It demonstrates that the proposed model achieves strong performance on 2D and 3D benchmark problems, including turbulent flow modeling. The model is able to handle problems with large number of grid points such as 2D Kolmogorov flow on 256x256 grid and 3D smoke simulation on 64x64x64 grid.4. It provides an analysis showing the attention matrices of the proposed model have higher rank and more compact spectrum compared to full softmax-free attention. This indicates the factorized attention is a more effective design.5. It incorporates techniques like latent marching and pushforward training to improve model stability for time-dependent problems.Overall, the main novelty is the proposed factorized attention mechanism that reduces the complexity and improves scalability. By combining this with other techniques, the paper demonstrates competitive performance on challenging fluid dynamics problems compared to state-of-the-art baselines.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- The use of Transformer architectures for PDE modeling is an emerging area of research, with several recent papers exploring this direction such as Galerkin Transformer, Fourier Neural Operator, and OFormer. This paper builds on those works by proposing a modified attention mechanism called Factorized Transformer to improve scalability.- Compared to prior works using full softmax attention, the proposed factorized attention reduces computational complexity and improves stability when applied to high-resolution multi-dimensional problems. The paper provides an analysis showing the attention matrices have a more compact spectrum compared to full attention.- The model is evaluated on challenging fluid simulation tasks in 2D and 3D and shows strong performance compared to baselines like Fourier Neural Operator and Dilated ResNet. It scales to large grids like 256x256 in 2D and 64x64x64 in 3D.- Concurrent works have also explored efficient Transformers for PDEs, such as linear attention, low-rank approximations, and axial attention. This paper offers an alternative factorization approach and analyzes differences compared to full softmax attention.- The projection operator and factorized kernel integral relate conceptually to other works on equipping neural networks with integral operators and tensor factorization.

The results demonstrate promising accuracy and efficiency gains on multidimensional fluid simulation tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more efficient and scalable attention mechanisms for Transformer models applied to PDEs. The authors note that their proposed factorized attention still faces the curse of dimensionality as the computational cost grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. They suggest exploring techniques like domain decomposition or learning in a reduced space to further improve efficiency and scalability.- Improving the stability of neural PDE solvers for time-dependent problems. The authors note that techniques like pushforward and latent marching can help, but developing more principled ways to ensure stability during unroll would be an important direction. This could involve incorporating more physics constraints or developing new training methodologies.- Exploring the theoretical approximation capabilities of different attention mechanisms and kernel integrals for solving PDEs. The authors suggest further analysis to better understand the representational capacity of different formulations.- Extending the factorized attention approach to other applications beyond PDEs, such as natural language processing or computer vision tasks. The potential benefits in terms of efficiency and stability could be investigated.- Developing additional techniques and architectures specialized for PDE modeling, building on insights like the kernel integral view of attention. For example, designing model components with certain invariance properties.- Combining data-driven modeling with traditional numerical PDE solvers, using techniques like residual correction or high-fidelity reconstruction. This could lead to hybrid methods that leverage the strengths of both.So in summary, continuing to improve Transformer models for PDEs, analyzing their theoretical properties, extending factorized attention to other domains, and combining neural and traditional PDE solvers seem to be key future directions highlighted. But there is certainly still lots of open research in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a scalable Transformer model called FactFormer for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). It is based on factorizing the attention mechanism into a set of axial kernels rather than computing attention over the full grid like standard Transformers. Specifically, it introduces a learnable projection operator that decomposes the input multivariate function into multiple univariate sub-functions. These sub-functions are then used to compute axial attention kernels efficiently. This allows the model to handle multidimensional problems with large grids, as the factorization avoids the curse of dimensionality faced by standard attention. The model is applied to simulate 2D turbulent flow and 3D buoyant smoke flow on grids up to 256x256 and 64x64x64 respectively. Comparisons show FactFormer achieves better accuracy and efficiency than baselines like Fourier Neural Operator and Dilated CNNs. The factorization is also shown to yield more compact attention matrices compared to full softmax-free attention. Overall, FactFormer enables scalable yet accurate simulation of complex multidimensional physical systems using the Transformer architecture.
