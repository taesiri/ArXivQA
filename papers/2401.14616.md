# [Alternative Speech: Complementary Method to Counter-Narrative for Better   Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hate speech online can spread harmful bias and discrimination. The common approach of detecting and blocking hate speech risks infringing on freedom of expression and does not address the root causes. 
- Counter-narratives can help diminish hate speech by correcting misperceptions with facts, but have limitations:
   - They lack ability to give practical alternative expressions that could substitute for hate speech in real situations
   - They still rely on blocking speech from public view, raising ethical concerns

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce a new concept called "Alternative Speech" 
   - Gives a practical alternative to hate speech by correcting it at the sentence level, while preserving context
   - Aims to guide speakers to proper language rather than just rebutting them
   - Can be shown publicly, avoiding some ethical issues and further educating

Key Contributions:
- Propose the novel concept of Alternative Speech to complement counter-narratives
- Provide guidelines for constructing Alternative Speech data 
- Validate via human survey that Alternative Speech is more specific and actionable than counter-narratives
- Show Combining Alternative Speech and counter-narratives creates a feedback loop that maximizes effectiveness
- Offer a new paradigm for combating online hate that focuses on constructive correction of speech

In summary, the paper puts forth Alternative Speech as a novel approach to mitigate hate speech in a more ethical, practical and ultimately effective manner by substituting proper language while preserving context and intent. It provides conceptual and implementational details on this new paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes "Alternative Speech", a complementary method to counter-narratives that provides direct speech-level corrections to hate speech while considering context to promote reform and address issues like discrimination.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing the concept of "Alternative Speech" as a new way to directly combat hate speech and complement the limitations of counter-narratives. Specifically:

1) An alternative speech provides practical alternatives to hate speech in real-world scenarios by offering speech-level corrections to speakers while considering the surrounding context and promoting speakers to reform. 

2) An alternative speech can combat hate speech alongside counter-narratives, offering a useful tool to address social issues such as racial discrimination and gender inequality. 

3) The paper proposes the new concept and provides detailed guidelines for constructing the necessary dataset. 

4) Through discussion, the paper demonstrates that combining alternative speech and counter-narrative can be a more effective strategy for combating hate speech by complementing specificity and guiding capacity of counter-narrative.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing alternative speech as a complementary method to counter-narratives to more effectively mitigate harmful bias in speech.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) What are the two main limitations of counter-narratives that alternative speeches aim to address? Explain these limitations in detail. 

2) What key principles were established for constructing the guidelines for alternative speeches? Discuss each principle in depth and provide examples.

3) How exactly does an alternative speech differ from a counter-narrative in terms of its approach and straightforwardness? Elaborate on the differences.

4) Explain in detail the benefit of having alternative speeches coexist with counter-narratives from a practical standpoint. What complementary roles do they play?

5) What criteria were used to evaluate alternative speeches in the human survey? Discuss each evaluation criteria and what it measured in depth.  

6) Analyze and discuss the key results from the human evaluation of alternative speeches versus counter-narratives. What inferences can be made?

7) How exactly does presenting both a counter-narrative and alternative speech jointly for the same hate speech maximize the suppression effect? Explain the feedback loop.  

8) What further research is required to explore regarding the usage and development of alternative speeches? Discuss at least 3 future research directions.

9) Discuss the ethical considerations involved in constructing a dataset of alternative speeches. What steps were taken in this study?  

10) Analyze some of the potential limitations or disadvantages of using alternative speeches to combat hate speech online. Are there risks involved?
