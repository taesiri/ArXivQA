# [Is a prompt and a few samples all you need? Using GPT-4 for data   augmentation in low-resource classification tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13861)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ChatGPT can be effectively used to augment small sets of human-generated training data for text classification tasks, particularly in low-resource settings. Specifically, the authors investigate whether synthetic training data generated by LLMs using simple prompts can be used to train models that achieve comparable or better performance than models trained on human-labeled data. They also explore the zero-shot classification capabilities of GPT-4 and ChatGPT on the classification tasks.The key hypothesis seems to be that even using simple prompts, LLMs can generate useful synthetic training data for low-resource classification tasks. The authors test this by augmenting small seed datasets across tasks of varying complexity, training models on the synthetic data, and comparing their performance to human-labeled data.In summary, the central research question is whether LLMs can be leveraged for effective data augmentation in sparse training data scenarios via basic prompting, particularly benefiting rare classes in imbalanced datasets. The hypothesis is that even simple prompts can produce synthetic data sufficient for training performant models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is experimenting with using large language models like GPT-4 and ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data by augmenting small sets of human-labeled examples. The authors test this approach on three NLP classification tasks of varying complexity within computational social science. They find that even with simple prompts, the synthetic training data can be used to train smaller in-house models that achieve good performance, particularly aiding low-resource settings like identifying rare classes. However, human-annotated data still tends to outperform synthetic data, indicating the need for more research into crafting better prompts to generate more diverse and informative synthetic examples. The key points are:- Using GPT-4 and ChatGPT to augment small labeled datasets with synthetic training data via simple prompts.- Testing this on 3 classification tasks with increasing complexity in computational social science.- Finding synthetic data can train models well, especially helping low-resource cases like rare classes.- Human-annotated data still largely outperforms synthetic data, showing need for more complex prompts.- Demonstrating the potential of LLMs for cheap and fast data augmentation in low-resource domains.So in summary, the main contribution is conducting new experiments on using large language models for data augmentation in low-resource settings via prompt engineering, and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of this approach compared to human-generated data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation:- The idea of using LLMs like GPT and ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data is novel and timely given the recent advances in these models. Most prior work has focused on using LLMs for annotating or labeling existing datasets rather than generating wholly new examples.- The authors take a simple prompt-based approach to generating synthetic examples from a small seed set, whereas some other papers have proposed more complex prompting techniques or frameworks like chain-of-thought prompting. The simple prompt design provides a useful baseline.- Evaluating the synthetic LLM-generated data against real human-annotated data across classification tasks of varying complexity is a nice contribution. Showing where synthetic data helps versus human data in low-resource scenarios is insightful.- The study is limited to three text classification tasks. Expanding to a wider range of NLP tasks could better reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the data augmentation approach. - The comparison between two LLMs - GPT-4 and ChatGPT - on data augmentation is useful. Testing other large models could further the understanding of how model size and architecture affect synthetic data quality.- The paper mentions the cost associated with generating data through the API, while other work has proposed training small local models to augment data which avoids this.- The prompts used are basic; more research into prompt engineering could likely improve the quality of synthesized data and close the gap with human annotations in some tasks.Overall the paper makes a solid contribution in rigorously exploring LLM-augmented data for low-resource NLP. The simple prompting approach provides a strong baseline. There are many promising future directions, such as evaluating on more tasks, testing other generation models, and prompt engineering. The results highlight the promise of LLMs for data augmentation given further research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more complex prompts for synthetic data augmentation that can generate more diverse and informative examples. The authors found human-annotated data outperformed synthetic data in some tasks, indicating potential for improvement in prompt engineering.- Further analyzing how synthetic examples differ from original real examples, in terms of lexical, semantic, and stylistic features. This could provide insights into creating better prompts that produce data similar to human annotations. - Exploring how different augmentation strategies like balancing the label distribution impacts downstream performance. The balanced data helped for the social dimensions task, suggesting value in this direction.- Testing the data augmentation framework on more tasks, including more complex ones involving rare classes and pragmatics. The authors suggest LLMs may be especially useful for low-resource, sparse tasks.- Comparing additional augmentation methods like oversampling and mixed sample augmentation. The oversampling strategy helped for one of their tasks.- Evaluating prompt-based zero-shot learning with more task-specific information provided, akin to few-shot learning. The authors used minimal prompts but more knowledge may improve zero-shot accuracy.- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for generated text, to select optimal prompts and augmentation strategies.- Analyzing how different choices of base dataset size and augmenting model impact overall performance.- Testing the approach on very large models like GPT-3 and Palm to assess scalability.In summary, the authors propose further work into prompt engineering, analyzing synthetic data characteristics, exploring augmentation strategies, more complex tasks, larger models, and better automatic evaluations as promising future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates using GPT-4 and ChatGPT to augment small labeled datasets with synthetic data for three NLP classification tasks of increasing complexity. For each task, they take a small sample of real data, generate synthetic examples using the LLMs, and train a 110M parameter multilingual model on the real and synthetic data. They find the LLMs have strong zero-shot performance on the test sets. The synthetic data aids performance in low-resource settings and for rare classes, but human-annotated data still outperforms synthetic data on two of the three tasks. This indicates the need for more complex prompting strategies to produce more diverse and realistic synthetic examples. Overall, the work provides valuable insights into using LLMs for data augmentation in low-resource domains, showing promise but also limitations using simple prompting approaches.
