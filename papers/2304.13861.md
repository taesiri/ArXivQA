# [Is a prompt and a few samples all you need? Using GPT-4 for data   augmentation in low-resource classification tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13861)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ChatGPT can be effectively used to augment small sets of human-generated training data for text classification tasks, particularly in low-resource settings. Specifically, the authors investigate whether synthetic training data generated by LLMs using simple prompts can be used to train models that achieve comparable or better performance than models trained on human-labeled data. They also explore the zero-shot classification capabilities of GPT-4 and ChatGPT on the classification tasks.The key hypothesis seems to be that even using simple prompts, LLMs can generate useful synthetic training data for low-resource classification tasks. The authors test this by augmenting small seed datasets across tasks of varying complexity, training models on the synthetic data, and comparing their performance to human-labeled data.In summary, the central research question is whether LLMs can be leveraged for effective data augmentation in sparse training data scenarios via basic prompting, particularly benefiting rare classes in imbalanced datasets. The hypothesis is that even simple prompts can produce synthetic data sufficient for training performant models.
