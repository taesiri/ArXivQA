# [Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper surveys the current state and future opportunities for applying large language models (LLMs) in games. LLMs have shown promise across many applications, but their potential in games is just beginning to be explored. Games serve as an important domain for AI research and an application area for AI techniques. The authors aim to chart the impact LLMs have had on games so far and analyze where they could be applied in the near-future. 

Proposed Solution & Contributions
The paper proposes a typology of the different roles an LLM can play in or around games: as a player, non-player character, player assistant, commentator/reteller, game master, game mechanic, automated designer, or design assistant. For each role, they survey existing work leveraging LLMs and identify gaps and future opportunities. Key contributions include:

- A broad survey of current research on applying LLMs in games across different roles 
- Identification of underexplored areas for LLMs in games like player/designer assistants and affective modeling
- Analysis of limitations of using LLMs in games, including biases, hallucinations, and legal/ethical issues
- Proposed roadmap detailing promising future research directions for LLMs to enhance gameplay and game design

The paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of LLMs at the intersection of games. By categorizing applications and laying out a research roadmap, the authors establish this survey as a basis for innovation in this emerging field. Their interdisciplinary perspective spanning AI, games, and ethics provides a holistic view of the potential benefits and challenges.
