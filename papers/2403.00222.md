# [Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Global Decision Making in the   Presence of Local Agents at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies reinforcement learning for global decision-making in the presence of many local agents. Specifically, there is a global agent that makes decisions affecting all local agents, with the goal of maximizing the cumulative rewards of both the global and local agents. However, the size of the state/action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, making this intractable. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an algorithm called SUB-SAMPLE-Q that allows the global agent to subsample a subset of k local agents (k≤n) to compute an approximate optimal policy in time exponential only in k rather than n. This provides an exponential speedup compared to standard methods.

Key Ideas:

1) The global agent performs empirical value iteration on the subsampled k agents to learn a smaller Q-function Γk,mˆ(s,a). This has complexity O(|Sg||Sl|ˆk|Ag|) rather than O(|Sg||Sl|ˆn|Ag|).

2) At each timestep, k agents are randomly subsampled and used by the global agent to take actions via Γk,mˆ. This yields a stochastic policy π ̃k,mˆ whose value function provably converges to the optimal policy as k→n and the number of Bellman updates m→∞.

3) A key technical novelty is a generalization of the DKW concentration inequality to bound the rate of convergence when sampling without replacement from a finite population. This allows proving that π ̃k,mˆ converges to π* at a rate of O(1/√k + εk,m) where εk,m is the Bellman noise.

4) There is a tradeoff in the choice of k between computation time and policy optimality, which is demonstrated in simulations. As k increases, the policy improves but runtime grows.

In summary, the paper provides an efficient, scalable algorithm for global decision-making that overcomes dimensionality issues through subsampling. Both theoretical guarantees and experiments on demand response and queueing systems demonstrate its effectiveness. The analysis rests on new concentration inequalities for sampling without replacement.
