# [The Performance Analysis of Spectrum Sharing between UAV enabled   Wireless Mesh Networks and Ground Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14988)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the spectrum sharing between unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless mesh networks and ground networks. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) deployment models of UAVs are considered. Stochastic geometry is applied to analyze the coverage performance of the UAV network and the ground network. The impact of UAV density, transmit power, height, and antenna directionality on the coverage probability is evaluated. It is shown that directional antennas can greatly improve the coverage performance compared to omnidirectional antennas. An optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal UAV altitude by maximizing the transmission capacity of the UAV network under the constraint on the ground network's quality of service. Both theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that proper UAV deployment and directional communications are beneficial for efficient spectrum sharing between aerial and ground networks. This work provides useful guidelines for designing spectrum sharing mechanisms and optimization of UAV wireless mesh networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions regarding spectrum sharing between UAV-enabled wireless mesh networks and ground networks:

1. It analyzes the coverage performance of both the UAV network and ground network users under spectrum sharing, considering both 2D and 3D deployment models for the UAVs. It derives analytical expressions for the coverage probabilities using tools from stochastic geometry.

2. It compares the coverage performance with omnidirectional and directional antennas for air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) transmissions. It shows that directional transmission can improve coverage compared to omnidirectional. 

3. It reveals an important insight - that when the vertical range (Î”h) of 3D UAV deployment tends to 0, the derived results for 3D deployment reduce to those for 2D deployment. This is verified through both analysis and simulations.

4. It formulates an optimization problem to determine the optimal UAV altitude by maximizing the transmission capacity of the UAV network under a constraint on the ground network user's coverage probability. 

5. Through comprehensive numerical and simulation results, it provides useful guidelines for designing spectrum sharing mechanisms between aerial mesh networks and ground networks.

In summary, this paper provides a theoretical performance analysis of spectrum sharing for UAV mesh networks using tools from stochastic geometry, considering various deployment models, antennas, and optimizations. The key findings provide insights to guide the development of such spectrum sharing systems.
