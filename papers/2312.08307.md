# [EquiReact: An equivariant neural network for chemical reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08307)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces EquiReact, a novel equivariant neural network for predicting properties of chemical reactions using the 3D geometries of reactants and products. EquiReact is flexible in leveraging available information like atom mappings, but also performs well without mappings. It demonstrates competitive predictive performance across three reaction datasets - GDB-22-TS, Cyclobutene, and Propargylation - outperforming previous state-of-the-art models in most settings. A key advantage is reduced sensitivity to geometry quality, allowing the use of lower-level quantum chemical computations while still achieving excellent predictions. The model exploits symmetries in the data, leading to improved data efficiency and extrapolation capabilities. By encoding geometries with equivariant features, EquiReact diminishes the performance gap between regimes with and without atom mappings. The authors illustrate how encoding 3D information allows predicting subtle changes in configurations affecting barriers. Overall, EquiReact advances machine learning for reaction property prediction through a flexible, data-efficient model effectively leveraging 3D structure.
