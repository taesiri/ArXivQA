# [Graph Learning-based Fleet Scheduling for Urban Air Mobility under   Operational Constraints, Varying Demand &amp; Uncertainties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04851)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the fleet scheduling problem for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) networks comprising multiple electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft operating across a set of vertiports. 
- Effective scheduling is needed to maximize operational profitability while satisfying constraints related to vertiport capacity, aircraft capacity, airspace safety corridors, time-varying passenger demand, and uncertainties caused by weather, delays, and aircraft downtime.  
- Existing optimization and learning methods for UAM fleet scheduling overlook some key operational complexities and constraints or have limited scalability.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulates the scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process and develops a centralized reinforcement learning policy architecture called CapTAIN.

- Represents state of the UAM network (vertiports and aircraft) as graphs and leverages Graph Capsule Convolutional Neural Networks to encode this structural information. 

- Utilizes Transformer encoder architecture to handle time-series data on passenger demand and fares.

- Employs a Multi-Head Attention-based decoder to select sequential actions based on encoded state information and specific problem context.

- Trains the model using Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm integrated with a simulation environment modeling key aspects and uncertainties.

Main Contributions:

- Novel graph-based state encoding using capsule networks to capture UAM network structure.

- Incorporation of Transformer networks to handle temporal demand/fare data.

- Custom context encoding and attention-based action decoding tailored to problem.

- Demonstrated improved performance over optimization and random baselines for unseen test scenarios.

- Significantly faster execution time compared to Genetic Algorithm optimization.

- Framework is generalizable to other vehicle/robot scheduling problems with similar structure and constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a graph reinforcement learning approach using a novel encoder-decoder policy architecture to perform online urban air mobility fleet scheduling under uncertainties and constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Formulating the UAM fleet scheduling problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and architecting a centralized encoder-decoder policy network to solve it. The state of the UAM network (vertiports and aircraft) is embedded by a Graph Neural Network (GNN), with additional context information from demand, pricing etc. processed separately. The scheduling actions are computed by a Multi-head Attention (MHA) based decoder using the GNN embeddings and context.

2) Integrating the policy network with a simulation environment that models the operation of a UAM network with 40 aircraft across 8 vertiports, including uncertainties, constraints, and time-varying demand data. 

3) Training the encoder-decoder network via policy gradient techniques and demonstrating its ability to generalize across unseen scenarios and uncertainties.

The key novelty lies in the design of the policy architecture using GNN and Transformer encoders and the MHA decoder to effectively capture the structure and uncertainties in the UAM fleet scheduling problem.
