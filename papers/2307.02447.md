# [Using Rewrite Strategies for Efficient Functional Automatic   Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02447)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we combine the elegance of automatic differentiation using dual numbers with efficient optimization via rewrite strategies?The key ideas and contributions appear to be:- Implementing automatic differentiation for a functional array programming language using dual numbers, which is conceptually clean.- Expressing optimizations on the differentiated programs as rewrite rules.- Controlling the application of rewrite rules using a strategy language to explore different optimization schedules.- Providing evidence via a microbenchmark that this approach can lead to asymptotically faster programs compared to unoptimized code.The motivation seems to be leveraging the benefits of dual numbers for automatic differentiation, while addressing the efficiency challenges via rewrite rule optimizations guided by strategies. The authors aim to demonstrate the viability of this approach on a simple array programming language.In summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that rewrite strategies can enable efficient optimization of automatic differentiation implemented via dual numbers in functional languages. The paper aims to provide a proof of concept for this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper seems to be using rewrite strategies for efficient automatic differentiation (AD). Specifically:- The paper implements AD for a functional array programming language using dual numbers, which provides an elegant and conceptually simple approach to differentiation. - To optimize the efficiency of the AD implementation, the paper leverages rewrite rules and strategy combinators. This allows fine-grained control over the schedule of applying optimizations, which can have significant impact as optimizations often enable further optimizations.- The rewrite rules and strategies are implemented in the Lean programming language. This allows combining the elegance of dual numbers-based AD with optimization strategies in a functional setting.- A microbenchmark is presented that shows the impact of optimizations, with the optimized AD program outperforming unoptimized AD and handwritten code. This demonstrates the potential benefits of using strategies for AD optimization.In summary, the key contribution seems to be exploring the synergy between dual numbers AD, rewrite strategies for optimization, and functional programming in Lean. This is presented as a novel approach to balancing correctness, clarity and performance for differentiable programming.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on differentiable programming and automatic differentiation:- It focuses specifically on implementing automatic differentiation (AD) in a functional array programming language, whereas much existing work has focused on imperative languages like Python. Using a functional language allows exploiting properties like referential transparency for optimization.- The approach is based on dual numbers, a common technique in functional AD implementations. This provides conceptual simplicity and aids correctness proofs. Other techniques like reverse-mode AD can be more complex to implement compositionally. - A key novelty is the use of rewrite rules and strategy combinators for optimizing the differentiated programs. This allows flexible control and ordering of optimizations, which can be important as optimizations depend on each other. Other AD frameworks typically use fixed sets of optimizations.- The implementation is embedded in the Lean proof assistant. This enables the use of dependent types to encode size information and prevent errors. Formal verification of the AD transformation could also be possible in the future.- It demonstrates the viability of the approach on a simple microbenchmark, showing asymptotic speedups compared to unoptimized code. But there is no comparison to state-of-the-art AD frameworks. More complex evaluation on ML models would be needed to determine competitiveness.In summary, the paper explores a novel synthesis of functional programming, dependent types, rewrite strategies and AD. It aims to combine advantages from each area. The paper offers initial evidence for the potential of this approach, but substantially more evaluation is needed to determine how it compares to existing imperative AD frameworks for larger ML models and benchmarks. Formal verification also remains future work.
