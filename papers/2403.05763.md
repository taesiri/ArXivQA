# [HDReason: Algorithm-Hardware Codesign for Hyperdimensional Knowledge   Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05763)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is an important reasoning task but poses challenges algorithmically due to high complexity of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and hardware-wise due to high training overheads. 
- Existing GPU/TPU accelerators for GCNs have memory bottlenecks while FPGAs can exploit more parallelism and improve efficiency. But current FPGA accelerators do not support critical KGC tasks like vertex/relation embedding training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel neurosymbolic algorithm called HDReason that uses hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to reduce complexity while maintaining accuracy and interpretability.  
- It also co-designs an FPGA acceleration framework tailored for HDReason with optimizations like encoded vector reuse, balanced vertex computation, and forward/backward co-optimization.

Key Contributions:
- First FPGA accelerator for end-to-end knowledge graph completion with support for vertex/relation embedding training
- Novel HDReason algorithm that balances accuracy, efficiency and interpretability for KGC using HDC  
- Hardware optimizations in the proposed accelerator like encoded vector reuse, balanced scheduling, and forward/backward co-optimization
- Significantly higher throughput and energy-efficiency over GPUs and prior FPGA accelerators for GCN training
- Robustness to aggressive quantization with minimal impact on HDReason's accuracy unlike GCNs
- Enhanced model transparency and interpretability compared to existing KGC techniques

In experiments, HDReason on FPGA provides 4.2× higher perf and 3.4× better energy efficiency compared to prior FPGA accelerators while delivering comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art GCNs. Over GPUs, it provides 10.6× speedup and 65× energy benefits revealing the efficiency of the co-designed accelerator framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes HDReason, a novel algorithm-hardware codesign approach combining hyperdimensional computing and FPGA acceleration to enable efficient and interpretable knowledge graph completion with customized hardware optimizations for high performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing HDReason, the first HDC-based model for knowledge graph completion (KGC), which achieves high accuracy while having lower complexity than GCN-based methods. 

2) Designing a customized FPGA accelerator for the HDReason model with several hardware optimizations such as reusing encoded hypervectors, balancing vertex computations, and co-optimizing forward and backward passes.

3) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed HDReason model and its FPGA accelerator through experiments on real-world KG datasets. The FPGA accelerator shows 4.2x speedup and 3.4x better energy efficiency compared to a state-of-the-art GCN training platform.

In summary, the key contribution is conducting algorithm-hardware codesign to enable efficient and accurate KGC on FPGAs using an HDC-based approach rather than conventional GCNs. Both the model and accelerator design are tailored for the KGC task.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a novel knowledge graph completion (KGC) algorithm based on hyperdimensional computing (HDC). How does the HDC-based algorithm differ from traditional embedding and graph convolutional network (GCN) based KGC algorithms? What are the advantages of using an HDC-based approach?

2) The paper introduces several hardware optimizations for accelerating the HDC-based KGC algorithm on FPGAs, including reusing encoded hypervectors, balancing vertex-to-vertex computations, and computing backward gradients in the forward pass. Can you explain these optimizations in more detail? How much speedup do they provide over baseline implementations?

3) The density-aware scheduler running on the CPU plays a key role in balancing computations across vertices with different degrees. What is the main idea behind this scheduler? How does it utilize both the triple and adjacency matrix representations of the knowledge graph? 

4) The paper stores already encoded vertex hypervectors in the FPGA's memory to avoid redundant computations. Can you explain the dispatcher IP module and its role in managing this process of reusing encoded hypervectors? What replacement policies are evaluated?

5) How does the score function IP module pipeline the scoring of a batch of queries? What techniques are used to compute gradients during the forward pass itself? What are the advantages of this approach?

6) How does the symbolic training acceleration module divide up the computation of gradients across the CPU and FPGA? What is the role of the chunk size T? What are the inputs, outputs and computations occurring in the two systolic arrays?

7) The paper demonstrates the robustness of the HDC-based model to aggressive dimension dropping and quantization. What causes this robustness in HDC models compared to GCNs? How is information encoded differently in hypervectors?

8) For what types of graphs and datasets is the proposed HDC-based approach likely to have an advantage over GCN-based techniques? When might a GCN model be more suitable than the method proposed in this paper?

9) The paper utilizes both single and double direction reasoning in its evaluation. Can you explain the difference between these two types of reasoning? What changes need to be made in the HDC model to support both modes?

10) The paper targets FPGAs for acceleration owing to their customizability and energy efficiency. Do you think this approach can be extended to other emerging accelerator technologies? What modifications would be required?
