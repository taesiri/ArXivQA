# [Learning to Zoom and Unzoom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15390)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to generalize intelligent input resampling techniques like "learning to zoom" to a broader range of computer vision tasks while retaining efficiency and differentiability. Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "Learning to Zoom and Unzoom" (LZU) that allows zooming on an input image, computing features on the zoomed image, and unzooming to revert any spatial deformations. The key hypotheses are:1. LZU can be applied to any task with 2D spatial input and any model with 2D spatial features, with no adjustments to the model or loss function.2. LZU can provide performance improvements over baseline models using uniform downsampling, across a variety of vision tasks.3. Using an approximate piecewise bilinear mapping allows efficient and differentiable computation of both the forward zoom and inverse unzoom.4. Unzooming spatial features can mitigate the need for task-specific modifications when using input image resampling.5. Intelligent resampling with LZU is beneficial even without access to high-resolution sensor data, implying it can be used as an attention mechanism.The paper empirically evaluates these hypotheses by applying LZU to object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D detection tasks using various models and datasets. The consistent performance improvements demonstrate the versatility of LZU as a general technique for efficient spatial attentional processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a general framework called "Learning to Zoom and Unzoom" (LZU) for improving the efficiency and accuracy of computer vision models under strict computational constraints. The key ideas are:- "Zooming" in on salient regions of the input image before feeding it into a model. This is done via a learned non-uniform resampling that samples densely at salient regions.- Processing the "zoomed" input with a spatial vision model to extract features.- "Unzooming" by inverting the warp and resampling features back to the original image space. This reverts any spatial distortions introduced by the "zoom".- The "unzoom" uses an efficient, differentiable approximation that allows for end-to-end training. - LZU can be applied to any model that operates on 2D spatial inputs and outputs 2D spatial features. It requires no changes to the model architecture or loss.The authors demonstrate LZU on a variety of tasks including 2D object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular 3D detection. In all cases, LZU improves accuracy over uniform downsampling baselines while adding minimal latency, showing it is an effective and general way to improve efficiency for spatial vision models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called Learning to Zoom and Unzoom (LZU) that intelligently resamples input images to focus computation on salient regions while handling tasks with spatial output, overcoming limitations of prior work that deformed the input in an irreversible manner.
