# [Learning to Zoom and Unzoom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15390)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to generalize intelligent input resampling techniques like "learning to zoom" to a broader range of computer vision tasks while retaining efficiency and differentiability. Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "Learning to Zoom and Unzoom" (LZU) that allows zooming on an input image, computing features on the zoomed image, and unzooming to revert any spatial deformations. The key hypotheses are:1. LZU can be applied to any task with 2D spatial input and any model with 2D spatial features, with no adjustments to the model or loss function.2. LZU can provide performance improvements over baseline models using uniform downsampling, across a variety of vision tasks.3. Using an approximate piecewise bilinear mapping allows efficient and differentiable computation of both the forward zoom and inverse unzoom.4. Unzooming spatial features can mitigate the need for task-specific modifications when using input image resampling.5. Intelligent resampling with LZU is beneficial even without access to high-resolution sensor data, implying it can be used as an attention mechanism.The paper empirically evaluates these hypotheses by applying LZU to object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D detection tasks using various models and datasets. The consistent performance improvements demonstrate the versatility of LZU as a general technique for efficient spatial attentional processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a general framework called "Learning to Zoom and Unzoom" (LZU) for improving the efficiency and accuracy of computer vision models under strict computational constraints. The key ideas are:- "Zooming" in on salient regions of the input image before feeding it into a model. This is done via a learned non-uniform resampling that samples densely at salient regions.- Processing the "zoomed" input with a spatial vision model to extract features.- "Unzooming" by inverting the warp and resampling features back to the original image space. This reverts any spatial distortions introduced by the "zoom".- The "unzoom" uses an efficient, differentiable approximation that allows for end-to-end training. - LZU can be applied to any model that operates on 2D spatial inputs and outputs 2D spatial features. It requires no changes to the model architecture or loss.The authors demonstrate LZU on a variety of tasks including 2D object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular 3D detection. In all cases, LZU improves accuracy over uniform downsampling baselines while adding minimal latency, showing it is an effective and general way to improve efficiency for spatial vision models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents Learning to Zoom and Unzoom (LZU), a novel framework for improving efficiency and performance of visual perception models under strict inference-time constraints. Here are some key ways this paper compares to related prior work:- It generalizes the nonuniform "learning to zoom" (LZ) downsampling techniques introduced in previous works like Learning to Zoom (Recasens et al.) and FOVEA (Thavamani et al.). LZU introduces an "unzooming" operation to efficiently invert the spatial deformations caused by nonuniform downsampling. This makes the approach more broadly applicable to tasks with spatial labels like detection and segmentation.- Compared to prior works on LZ downsampling, LZU demonstrates superior versatility by evaluating on a more diverse set of tasks (2D detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D detection) and datasets. The paper shows that LZU can be applied to any model architecture with spatial feature maps, with minimal changes.- For semantic segmentation, LZU achieves competitive performance to specialized prior methods like Optimal Edge Sampling (Marin et al.) and LDS (Jin et al.) that also aim to zoom on semantic boundaries. At higher resolutions like 256x256, LZU actually outperforms these prior works.- For 2D detection, LZU outperforms FOVEA (the most comparable prior work) on Argoverse-HD while being more generalizable. FOVEA relies on bounding box transformations specific to detection while LZU works for any task with spatial outputs.- LZU is the first work to apply intelligent downsampling to monocular 3D object detection, a task which no prior work had tackled before. It demonstrates consistent gains over naive uniform downsampling.- An interesting finding is that LZU brings performance gains even in the absence of high-resolution inputs. This suggests it can also serve as a method for learned upsampling.Overall, LZU makes both theoretical and empirical improvements over prior work on efficient learned downsampling. The increased generality and strong results across tasks demonstrate it is a practical and versatile approach for perception under inference-time constraints.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Explore alternatives to the "unzoom" formulation that are less destructive than simple resampling of features. The paper notes that simply resampling the features during unzooming can be destructive, so investigating other approaches could lead to further improvements.- Use an adaptive, learned formulation for saliency instead of fixed saliency maps. The authors hypothesize that learning an adaptive saliency map could lead to additional performance gains.- Apply the method to settings with temporal priming for top-down saliency, like video object detection/tracking. The authors suggest their method could particularly shine when saliency is adaptively learned using temporal information.- Optimize the runtime of the non-separable warp inversion to make it fast enough to support favorable accuracy-latency tradeoffs. The non-separable inversion currently incurs too much latency, but the authors believe further optimization could make it practical.- Experiment with different task-specific networks as the base model. The generality of the approach means it could likely bring benefits to many different network architectures.- Evaluate the approach on additional tasks/datasets beyond the ones studied. The authors demonstrate it on detection, segmentation and 3D detection, but it may be broadly applicable to other vision tasks too.- Study the effects of different saliency priors like semantics, surfaces, geometry etc. The fixed saliency maps in the paper are somewhat simplistic, so more informed saliency could further improve results.So in summary, the key directions are around exploring alternatives to unzooming, using learned adaptive saliency, applying it to video and other tasks, optimizing runtime, trying different base models, evaluating on more tasks/datasets, and using richer saliency priors. The versatility of the method suggests there are many interesting research avenues to explore.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a general framework called "Learning to Zoom and Unzoom" (LZU) for more efficient processing of high-resolution images under strict computational constraints. The key idea is to non-uniformly downsample the input image by "zooming in" on salient regions, compute features on the warped image, and then efficiently "unzoom" to revert any spatial distortions before output. This allows the model to focus computation on the most informative regions while retaining full spatial resolution. To enable efficient unzooming, they approximate the spatial warp with invertible piecewise bilinear mappings. LZU can be applied to any model that processes 2D inputs and contains 2D spatial feature maps, with no adjustments to the model or loss function. They demonstrate this versatility on object detection, semantic segmentation, and 3D detection tasks using standard models like RetinaNet, PSPNet, and FCOS3D. In all cases, LZU improves efficiency and accuracy over uniform downsampling baselines, with consistent gains across tasks and minimal overhead. An interesting additional finding is that LZU can even boost performance in the absence of high-res inputs, suggesting it provides a more general attention mechanism beyond just input downsampling.
