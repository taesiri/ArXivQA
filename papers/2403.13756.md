# [Enhancing Gait Video Analysis in Neurodegenerative Diseases by Knowledge   Augmentation in Vision Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13756)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Quantitative analysis of gait impairments is important for assessing neurodegenerative diseases, but current clinical methods have limitations like requiring specialized equipment or failing to capture representative moments during short clinic visits.  
- Video-based gait analysis offers possibilities for cost-effective, remote monitoring to enable timely assessment, but existing video-based methods struggle with insufficient pathological data and balancing normal data. There is a need for data-efficient approaches that can transfer representations from large-scale pre-trained models.

Proposed Method  
- Leverages a large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) and enhances its representations for pathological gait classification via two strategies:
   1) Knowledge-aware prompt tuning utilizing class-specific medical descriptions to guide text prompt learning
   2) Incorporating paired numerical gait parameters as numerical texts to enhance numeracy of text representations
- Performs cross-modal contrastive learning on videos, descriptions, and gait parameters to align representations.
- Learns interpretable representations that can be decoded into natural language gait descriptions using vocabulary of parameters.

Contributions
- First VLM-based method for analysis of pathological gait videos
- Knowledge-aware prompt tuning with medical descriptions 
- Numeracy-enhanced text representations aligned via contrastive learning
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on two gait classification tasks with limited data
- Learns representations that can be decoded into human-interpretable gait descriptions

In summary, the paper presents a novel transfer learning strategy to adapt Vision-Language Models for gait analysis by augmenting representations with medical knowledge and gait parameters. This improves performance and interpretability despite data limitations.
