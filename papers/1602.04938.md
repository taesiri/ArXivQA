# ["Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes LIME, a novel explanation technique that can explain the predictions of any classifier or regressor in an interpretable and faithful manner. 

- LIME explains predictions by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction, thus maintaining fidelity to the original model.

- The paper frames the problem of explaining a model globally as selecting a set of representative individual prediction explanations in a non-redundant way, via submodular optimization.

- The utility of explanations for trust-related tasks is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, across text and image classification.

- Explanations are shown to help users determine whether to trust predictions, choose between models, improve untrustworthy classifiers, and gain insight into model failures.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that providing faithful explanations of individual predictions and models can improve human understanding and trust, which is validated through the experiments conducted. The key research questions revolve around how to generate explanations that are interpretable, locally faithful, and provide global perspective into any black-box classifier.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), a technique to explain the predictions of any machine learning classifier or model in an interpretable manner. The key ideas are:

- LIME explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model. This allows explaining complex models like neural networks in a faithful way.

- The explanations are model-agnostic, meaning they treat the original model as a black box. This allows explaining any model, including future classifiers.

- Interpretability is built into the optimization, by using explanations that are inherently interpretable like sparse linear models or decision trees, with complexity control.

- LIME also proposes a method called SP-LIME to pick representative and non-redundant predictions along with explanations, to provide a global perspective of the model. This helps assess overall trust in the model.

The paper shows through experiments that LIME explanations help with several trust-related tasks for text and image classifiers:

- Deciding whether to trust an individual prediction

- Choosing between competing models

- Improving an untrustworthy classifier via feature engineering 

- Getting insights into model failures and biases

The key novelty is the ability to explain any black-box model in an inherently interpretable way, model-agnostically, while being locally faithful. This provides a general technique to understand and improve trust in predictions and models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner by learning an interpretable local model around individual predictions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on explaining machine learning model predictions:

- It proposes LIME, a new model-agnostic method to explain any classifier or regressor. This makes it more flexible than methods tailored to specific models like neural networks.

- The explanations are optimized to be locally faithful to the model's behavior near the instance being explained. Many other methods aim for global fidelity which can be harder to achieve.

- The paper emphasizes the importance of producing explanations that are interpretable to humans. It incorporates interpretability directly into the optimization and representation, unlike some methods that focus only on fidelity.

- It introduces Submodular Pick to select a small set of representative explanations that give a global view of the model. This addresses model understanding beyond just single instances.

- The evaluation includes both simulated experiments to test properties of the explanations, and human subjects experiments to measure the impact on trust and model understanding. Many papers focus more narrowly on one type of evaluation.

- The variety of experiments covers text, image and neural network models. Many explanation papers focus on a single domain like images. The flexibility of LIME is demonstrated on diverse use cases.

Overall, this paper stands out for its general and flexible approach, focus on human interpretability, and comprehensive evaluation. The novel optimization, submodular pickup method, and experiments on trust distinguish LIME from prior work on explaining predictions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several avenues for future work:

- Explore different explanation families (besides sparse linear models), such as decision trees, to see how they perform with real users.

- Develop methods to select representative instances and generate explanations for images, as the current pick step focuses on text applications.

- Apply LIME to a variety of domains beyond text and images, such as speech, video, and medical data. Also test it on recommendation systems.

- Investigate theoretical properties like the appropriate number of samples needed, and optimize computation through parallelization and GPU processing. This could enable accurate, real-time explanations.

- Conduct user studies to compare different interpretable representations and evaluate how explanation fidelity impacts trust and other outcomes. 

- Explore adaptations like having dynamic complexity measures that change based on user expertise and the instance being explained.

- Incorporate LIME into existing tools for model debugging and transparency like Modeltracker to provide explanations for individual predictions.

In summary, the main future directions are: optimizing the methods, expanding to new domains and models, integrating with existing tools, and conducting further user studies to evaluate the effects of different explanation design choices. The overarching goal is enabling LIME to provide useful explanations across a wide variety of real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), a technique to explain the predictions of any machine learning classifier in an interpretable manner. LIME works by approximating the classifier locally with an interpretable model, selecting samples around an instance being explained and weighting them by proximity to fit a simple model. The authors also propose SP-LIME, which picks a set of representative and non-redundant explanations to provide a global understanding of the model. The paper demonstrates through simulated and real user experiments that LIME explanations help assess trust and understand models for text and image classifiers. Key results show that LIME helps non-experts pick which classifier generalizes better, improve an untrustworthy classifier by removing unreliable features, and identify when a model utilizes fallacious correlations. Overall, the results validate that LIME explanations are useful for a variety of trust related tasks with machine learning models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner. LIME learns an interpretable model locally around the prediction by sampling instances, getting predictions from the original model, and training an interpretable model on this dataset. The paper also proposes SP-LIME, a method to explain models globally by selecting representative individual predictions and explanations in a non-redundant way using submodular optimization. 

The authors demonstrate the utility of LIME for explaining predictions and models through comprehensive simulated and human subject evaluations. In simulated experiments, they show LIME explanations are locally faithful, help identify trustworthy predictions, and allow selecting the best model. In human experiments, non-experts using LIME are able to pick the classifier that generalizes better, improve an untrustworthy classifier by doing feature engineering, and identify when a classifier makes predictions for the wrong reasons. The results show that LIME explanations can enhance trust in predictions and models for machine learning practitioners and non-experts alike.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), a method to explain the predictions of any machine learning classifier in an interpretable manner. The key idea is to approximate the model locally with an interpretable model that is faithful to the original model in the vicinity of the prediction being explained. 

To generate an explanation, LIME first randomly samples instances around the prediction, obtains the blackbox model's predictions for those instances, and weighs them by their proximity to the instance being explained. This data is then used to train an interpretable model, such as a sparse linear model, that approximates the blackbox model locally. The interpretable model is constrained to be simple and sparse to enhance interpretability. Specifically for text, LIME constrains the interpretable model to use only a small set of the most important words. For images, it selects a small number of superpixels. The explanation produced is the simplified interpretable model, which highlights the key parts of the instance (words or image regions) that lead to the blackbox model's prediction.

By learning to approximate the blackbox model locally, LIME is able to generate explanations that are locally faithful while being model-agnostic. The paper shows that this approach can effectively explain a variety of complex models like random forests and neural networks for text and image classification.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of explaining and interpreting the predictions of machine learning models, particularly for the purposes of establishing trust and understanding. The key questions and problems it tackles are:

- How to explain individual predictions of any classifier or model in an interpretable and faithful manner, treating the model as a black box. This allows explaining models that are complex and non-interpretable themselves.

- How to select representative and non-redundant explanations to provide a global understanding of the model's behavior. This allows assessing overall trust in the model.

- Evaluating whether explanations help establish trust and aid in tasks like determining if a prediction should be trusted, choosing between models, improving models, and identifying when not to trust a model. This demonstrates the utility of explanations for trust.

In summary, the main focus is on generating model-agnostic explanations that can establish trust in predictions and models, especially for black-box complex models. The explanations need to be interpretable, locally faithful, and help in assessing trust through tasks like choosing models and improving models.
