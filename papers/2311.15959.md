# [CheapNET: Improving Light-weight speech enhancement network by projected   loss function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15959)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel projection loss function to enhance the performance of lightweight speech enhancement networks for noise suppression and acoustic echo cancellation tasks. The key innovation is shifting the learning target to the projection of the clean speech amplitude spectrum onto the noisy input spectrum, addressing limitations of MSE-based methods. On this foundation, the authors introduce CHEAPNET, comprised of simple GRU networks, which achieves near state-of-the-art results in both tasks with only 3.1M parameters and 0.4 GFlops/s complexity. For noise suppression, CHEAPNET with the projection loss demonstrates higher STOI and PESQ scores compared to prominent baseline models like NSNet and DPTNet. For acoustic echo cancellation, applying the projection loss enabled direct mask prediction on LAEC-processed outputs, boosting performance over industry-leading solutions as measured by WB_PESQ, NB_PESQ and other metrics. The effectiveness across tasks validates the projection loss for more accurate targets, while direct LAEC masking introduces a new perspective. The lightweight yet competitive CHEAPNET models prove that complex networks are not necessary for robust speech enhancement given methodological innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel projection loss function to improve lightweight speech enhancement networks for noise suppression and echo cancellation tasks, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with very low computational complexity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel projection loss function that enables models to more accurately predict the most significant vocal component within noisy audio samples. This loss function shifts the learning target to the projection of the clean speech amplitude spectrum onto the noisy amplitude spectrum.

2) Applying the projection loss function to acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) tasks, allowing models to directly predict masks on pre-processed outputs from the look-ahead echo cancellation (LAEC) method. This enhances echo cancellation performance.

3) Introducing CHEAPNET, a methodology that utilizes simple GRU networks to achieve competitive speech quality enhancement in both noise suppression and echo cancellation tasks, with much lower complexity than state-of-the-art models.

In summary, the key innovation is the projection loss function, which helps improve prediction accuracy. This is applied to both noise suppression and AEC tasks using an efficient GRU-based architecture called CHEAPNET. The combination of the novel loss, application to AEC via LAEC outputs, and the low-complexity CHEAPNET model are the main contributions.
