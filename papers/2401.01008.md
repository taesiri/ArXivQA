# [Fast Inference Through The Reuse Of Attention Maps In Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) can generate high-quality images but have high latency during sampling. 
- Existing methods to reduce DPM latency either reduce the number of calls to the U-net (increasing approximation error) or reduce the cost per call (requiring retraining).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a training-free approach to reduce DPM latency without changing the sampler's step size.
- It exploits redundancies in repeatedly calculating attention maps by reusing past attention maps during sampling. 
- An initial heuristic reuse policy (HURRY) is proposed based on analysis of error propagation in DPMs using Lyapunov exponents.
- HURRY is further refined by an efficient local search to find the policy PHAST which outperforms HURRY.

Main Contributions:
- Show attention maps exhibit redundancy that can be exploited to accelerate sampling.
- Develop reuse policies HURRY and PHAST to exploit this redundancy.
- PHAST reduces DPM latency by 25-30% with minimal impact on sample quality.
- The proposed approach is training-free and plug-and-play applicable to pre-trained DPMs.
- Demonstrate superior sample quality compared to step-reduced samplers of equal latency.
- Establish that the search generalizes across different sampler and model configurations.

In summary, the paper puts forth a novel perspective on accelerating DPM sampling by reusing attention maps between steps rather than changing step size or model architecture. The analysis-driven search leads to practical policies that accelerate sampling in a model-agnostic manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a training-free approach to accelerate diffusion probabilistic models by reusing attention maps during sampling to reduce computational costs, with empirical and theoretical justifications for selecting optimal reuse policies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The development of reuse policies that reduce the latency of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) for text-to-image generation while retaining the step size of the original sampler and not requiring retraining or altering the model weights. 

2. The production of two increasingly refined reuse policies called HURRY and PHAST that can be applied in a plug-and-play manner to existing DPMs to improve their latency with minimal impact on sample quality.

3. The discovery through analysis that there is redundancy in the repeated calculation of attention maps during DPM sampling that can be exploited, as well as a positive (attention-adapted) Lyapunov exponent suggesting a coarse step-wise reuse policy.

4. Refining the initial heuristic HURRY policy through local search to produce PHAST, a permutation of HURRY that is shown to outperform step-reduced samplers of comparable latency.

5. Showcasing strong performance of the proposed reuse policies, generating samples closer in quality to a baseline DPM approach compared to simply reducing the number of steps. The policies offer a training-free way to accelerate DPMs while better preserving sample quality.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and demonstration of successful reuse policies that can plug-and-play accelerate DPM image generation by exploiting redundancies in attention map calculation, without model retraining or step size reduction.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs)
- Text-to-image generation
- Latency reduction 
- Attention map reuse

- Stable Diffusion

The paper focuses on reducing the latency of diffusion models for text-to-image generation by reusing attention maps instead of recalculating them at each step. Key concepts include analyzing error propagation using Lyapunov exponents to motivate an initial reuse strategy, empirically searching for better reuse policies, comparing to knowledge distillation and step size reduction methods, and evaluating on metrics like PSNR, FID score, and CLIP score. The core goal is accelerating high-quality image synthesis from diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner without additional training.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes exploiting redundancies in the repeated calculation of attention maps to reduce latency. Why are attention maps particularly important contributors to latency in diffusion models? 

2. The analysis section introduces a dynamical model relating perturbations in attention maps to perturbations in the final sample. It assumes an exponential growth/decay of errors. What is the justification behind using an exponential model? How well does this match the empirical analysis?

3. The initial heuristic reuse policy HURRY is motivated by the dynamical model. However, the paper notes several deficiencies with this model. What are some of the key oversimplifications made, and how could they be addressed in future work?

4. The permuted heuristic attention strategy PHAST is found by locally searching around HURRY. What is the justification behind expecting the global optimum to be found close to HURRY? How computationally efficient is this search procedure compared to alternatives?

5. Attention maps are reused in discrete steps across all layers. What is the justification behind focusing on step-wise rather than layer-wise policies? How does the paper investigate this trade-off empirically?

6. Various metrics are used to evaluate sample quality, including PSNR, FID score, and CLIP score. Why is PSNR used during method development? What are the limitations of each metric in assessing performance?  

7. How well do the proposed reuse policies generalize across different base samplers and models? What explanations are provided for differences in performance between samplers?

8. There is a trade-off between latency, memory usage, and numerical precision when reusing attention maps. How does the paper investigate this? What further investigations could be done?

9. The results demonstrate performance gains over baseline step-reduced solvers. What explanations are provided for why reuse policies outperform simply reducing steps? When might step-reduction be preferred?

10. The method is "training-free" and acts in a "plug-and-play" manner with pre-trained models. What are the limitations of this approach compared to methods that incorporate knowledge distillation or model optimization?
