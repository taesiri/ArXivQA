# [Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking with Approximate Bayesian   Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and ranking candidate policies offline before real-world deployment is critical for safety and reliability. 
- Existing off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods rely on precise value estimation, which fails in scenarios with sparse rewards or low-quality reward representations. 
- They also cannot analyze special case performance like worst or best cases.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking (POPR), a framework to rank policies by characterizing the probability of a candidate policy behaving like an expert policy using limited expert demonstration data.

- POPR estimates the entire performance posterior distribution to help with ranking policies in worst, best and average cases, without needing rewards or value estimation.

- An energy-based Approximate Bayesian Computation method called POPR-EABC is proposed to estimate the posterior. It uses a smooth energy function to measure similarity between expert and candidate data to avoid specifying heuristic summary statistics. 

- A pseudo-likelihood is introduced to parameterize the energy variance and facilitate Bayesian inference for efficient posterior estimation.

Main Contributions:
- A new Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking framework to rank policies using limited expert demonstrations without requiring rewards.

- A novel posterior distribution formulation to characterize candidate policies' performance relative to an expert policy. Enables special case analysis.

- An energy-based ABC method called POPR-EABC that uses a smooth energy function and pseudo-likelihood for efficient Bayesian posterior inference of performance.

- Empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous environments demonstrating POPR-EABCâ€™s effectiveness over baselines in ranking, comparison and analyzing policies.
