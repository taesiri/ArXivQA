# [Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking with Approximate Bayesian   Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11551)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating and ranking candidate policies offline before real-world deployment is critical for safety and reliability. 
- Existing off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods rely on precise value estimation, which fails in scenarios with sparse rewards or low-quality reward representations. 
- They also cannot analyze special case performance like worst or best cases.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking (POPR), a framework to rank policies by characterizing the probability of a candidate policy behaving like an expert policy using limited expert demonstration data.

- POPR estimates the entire performance posterior distribution to help with ranking policies in worst, best and average cases, without needing rewards or value estimation.

- An energy-based Approximate Bayesian Computation method called POPR-EABC is proposed to estimate the posterior. It uses a smooth energy function to measure similarity between expert and candidate data to avoid specifying heuristic summary statistics. 

- A pseudo-likelihood is introduced to parameterize the energy variance and facilitate Bayesian inference for efficient posterior estimation.

Main Contributions:
- A new Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking framework to rank policies using limited expert demonstrations without requiring rewards.

- A novel posterior distribution formulation to characterize candidate policies' performance relative to an expert policy. Enables special case analysis.

- An energy-based ABC method called POPR-EABC that uses a smooth energy function and pseudo-likelihood for efficient Bayesian posterior inference of performance.

- Empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous environments demonstrating POPR-EABC’s effectiveness over baselines in ranking, comparison and analyzing policies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework called Probabilistic Offline Policy Ranking (POPR) to evaluate and compare candidate policies relative to expert policies by estimating their posterior performance distribution, without requiring access to rewards or the behavior policy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes POPR, a probabilistic framework for offline policy ranking that characterizes and compares candidate policies' performance distributions relative to expert policies, without needing access to reward values or behavioral policies. 

The key contributions are:

1) It introduces a statistic θ that measures how consistent a candidate policy is with an expert policy, and estimates the posterior distribution p(θ | expert data) to holistically profile the candidate's performance.

2) It proposes POPR-EABC, an energy-based approximate Bayesian computation method, to efficiently estimate the posterior p(θ | expert data). This uses a smooth energy function and pseudo-likelihood to avoid specifying heuristic summary statistics and improves sampling efficiency.  

3) Extensive experiments on multiple RL tasks with discrete/continuous actions demonstrate POPR-EABC can effectively rank and compare policies. It works well even with small expert datasets and is robust to data quality. The estimated performance posteriors also enable analyzing special cases like worst/best case behaviors.

In summary, the key contribution is a new probabilistic framework and method for offline policy evaluation and comparison using limited expert data, without needing the true rewards or value functions.

- Offline policy ranking (OPR) - Evaluating and ranking candidate policies using offline datasets without interacting with the environment online.

- Off-policy evaluation (OPE) - Estimating the value or quality of a target policy using data collected under a different behavior policy.

- Probabilistic offline policy ranking (POPR) - A framework proposed in this paper to address OPR by characterizing the probability of a candidate policy behaving similarly to expert demonstrations.  

- Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) - A likelihood-free inference approach used to estimate model parameters by simulations. Leveraged in this work to estimate policy performance posterior.

- Energy-based inference - Using a smooth energy function to measure similarity between expert and policy data instead of specifying heuristic summary statistics in standard ABC. 

- Pseudo-likelihood - A computationally simpler approximation of the likelihood using the empirical distribution of energy values. Used along with the prior in posterior inference.

- Performance posterior - The posterior distribution that captures uncertainty in evaluating how well a candidate policy matches expert behavior. Enables special case analysis.

- Jensen-Shannon divergence - A method used to quantify the distance between expert and policy state-action distributions.

In summary, the key focus is on proposing a probabilistic framework called POPR for policy ranking, with an ABC-based method called POPR-EABC to estimate performance posteriors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an energy-based approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method. Can you explain in detail how the energy function is used to measure the similarity between the expert and candidate policy data? What are the benefits of using an energy function over specifying tolerance parameters on summary statistics?

2. The paper introduces a pseudo-likelihood that approximates the joint likelihood of the data using the energy values. Can you walk through how the mean and variance of the bootstrapped energy values are used to parameterize the Beta distribution for the pseudo-likelihood? Why is the Beta distribution a good choice here?  

3. The proposed ABC method relies on Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling to estimate the posterior distribution. How exactly is the accept/reject criteria designed using the pseudo-likelihood? What role does the prior distribution play?

4. The posterior characterization of a candidate policy's performance enables special case analysis like worst-case and best-case comparisons. Can you explain how the framework conducts such analysis after obtaining posterior samples? What metrics or procedures are used?

5. How does the framework handle probabilistic pairwise comparison between policies? What is the meaning of the cumulative probability plots in Figure 3 and how do they differentiate policy quality?

6. The method claims robustness to small expert dataset sizes. What experiments were conducted to demonstrate this and what were the key results? How do you think dataset size affects the uncertainty in the posterior distribution?  

7. For handling poor quality expert data, what kind of experiments were performed by mixing expert and non-expert trajectories? What level of expert data fraction still lead to good results? Why?

8. Can you explain the motivation behind using Jensen-Shannon divergence versus other similarity measures for the energy function? What differences were observed empirically?

9. What variations were explored regarding the prior distribution form and parameters? How much do results depend on the exact prior used?

10. The paper mentions extending the method to incorporate multiple expert policies. Can you sketch how the framework could be expanded for this scenario? What aggregation approaches could be used to consolidate evaluations from different experts?
