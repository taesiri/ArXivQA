# [Language Agents as Optimizable Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16823)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are many different methods and codebases for building LLM-based autonomous agents or problem solvers. However, they are disparate and require a lot of human engineering to define prompts and agent workflows.
- It is challenging to effectively integrate different components like LLMs, memory, planning, and tool use into a unified framework.
- Automatically improving prompt engineering and orchestration of multiple agents is an open research question.

Proposed Solution - GPTSwarm:
- Represents agent systems as computational directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Nodes are operations like LLM queries, tool use. Edges indicate data flow between operations.
- Agent graphs can be composed into larger composite graphs that represent swarms/societies of agents. New edges characterize communication channels.
- Leverages graph structure for automatic optimization via prompting or RL techniques to:
   - Refine node prompts (node optimization)  
   - Improve agent communication patterns by changing graph topology (edge optimization)

Key Contributions:
- Unified representation of disparate LLM agent systems as optimizable graphs
- Open-source modular framework for flexible agent construction 
- Automatic prompt engineering through node optimization
- Automatic orchestration improvement via edge optimization with RL
- Validated benefits on multiple benchmarks including efficiency gains and SOTA performances

In summary, the paper introduces a graph-based formulation to model LLM agent systems. The representation enables automated optimization techniques for prompts and agent workflows. Experiments show efficiency, flexibility and performance improvements on various tasks.
