# [Weathering Ongoing Uncertainty: Learning and Planning in a Time-Varying   Partially Observable Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03263)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new framework called Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (TV-POMDPs) to model decision-making under uncertainty in environments that change over time. A key challenge is that past experiences can become obsolete under time-variation. To address this, the authors propose Memory Prioritized State Estimation (MPSE) which selectively prioritizes pertinent historical observations alongside new data to optimize state estimation accuracy. This leverages the insight that in gradually changing environments, old experiences still hold relevance. An associated planning strategy is also presented that exploits the modeled time-varying transitions for optimizing action selection. The authors validate the approach through marine robot simulations and ground robot experiments involving navigation in uncertain, stochastic settings. Results demonstrate MPSE's ability to balance retaining prior learning versus acquiring new samples for swift adaptation. This facilitates superior performance compared to methods relying solely on recent observations. By continuously recalibrating the balance between past and present, MPSE enables resilient planning despite unpredictable changes over time. The integrated framework successfully tackles core limitations in prevailing approaches to enhance autonomous decision-making under partial observability, stochasticity and time-variation.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Process framework and a Memory Prioritized State Estimation method to model uncertain, stochastic, time-varying environments and enable more accurate state estimation and optimal planning for sequential decision making in such environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (TV-POMDP) framework to model decision-making problems with time-varying, stochastic dynamics and partial observability. The paper also introduces a method called Memory Prioritized State Estimation (MPSE) to facilitate more accurate state estimation and planning within the TV-POMDP framework. Specifically, MPSE selectively prioritizes observations in memory based on their potential informativeness to provide better estimates of the time-varying transitions. The paper also presents an associated planning strategy tailored to leverage these modeled time-varying transitions for optimized action selection over long horizons. Through simulated and real-world experiments, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed TV-POMDP framework and MPSE method for decision-making in uncertain, stochastic, partially observable, and time-varying environments.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (TV-POMDP) to model time-varying stochastic environments. How does this model differ from standard POMDPs and what additional capabilities does it provide?

2. The paper introduces a weighted memory prioritization scheme that considers autocorrelation, recency and deviation of observations. What is the motivation behind using these specific factors to assign weights? How do they quantitatively capture the usefulness of past observations?

3. The paper formulates a constrained maximum likelihood optimization problem to estimate the time-varying transition function. Why is a maximum likelihood approach suitable in this context compared to other probabilistic estimation techniques? Why is the constraint on maximum rate of change necessary?

4. When updating the belief state, the method incorporates the estimated time-varying transition function. How does this differ from a standard Bayesian belief update? Why is this adjustment important for planning in TV-POMDPs?

5. The policy optimization leverages the modified value function $V_t(b)$ that now depends on time. How does the expression for $V_t(b)$ differ from the standard POMDP value function? Why must the value function be time-dependent in TV-POMDPs?

6. The method is evaluated in two distinct real-world experiments - one with a marine robot, another with a ground robot. What are the key differences between these experimental scenarios and what common time-varying effects do they emulate?  

7. In the marine experiments, how do the results demonstrate the advantages of selective memory prioritization for handling time-varying dynamics compared to the baselines? What core limitations of the baselines does this highlight?

8. In the ground robot experiment, an abrupt change is introduced midway by switching the transition function. How does the proposed method demonstrate effective adaptation compared to the baselines? What enables this?

9. From an implementation perspective, what are the key algorithmic components and steps involved in deploying the proposed approach on a physical system? What are some practical challenges faced?

10. The method makes an assumption regarding maximum rate of change of the dynamics. What is the implication of this assumption? How would performance degrade if this assumption is violated in practice?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of sequential decision-making and control in uncertain, stochastic environments that are subject to time-variation. Specifically, it considers scenarios such as an autonomous marine robot traversing unfamiliar terrain, where environmental dynamics like waves, winds, and currents vary over time in unpredictable ways. This time-variation introduces uncertainty in the robot's dynamics that is difficult to accurately model or predict. Existing frameworks like MDPs and POMDPs assume stationary transition probabilities and are unable to effectively incorporate temporal variability.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a "Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Process" (TV-POMDP) to model such time-varying stochastic environments. This retains the standard POMDP formulation while making the transition and reward functions time-dependent to capture variability. To facilitate estimation and planning within TV-POMDPs, a two-pronged approach is presented:

1) Memory Prioritized State Estimation (MPSE): This selectively prioritizes past observations to estimate the time-varying transitions, based on metrics like autocorrelation, recency and deviation. The priority weights are used within a maximum likelihood estimate to optimize estimation accuracy.

2) MPSE-integrated planning: The estimated transitions are leveraged to optimize policy and action selection to maximize long-term rewards. The planning accounts for temporal constraints and evolves the policy as dynamics change.

Key Contributions:

- Introduction of TV-POMDP framework to model time-varying, stochastic environments with partial observability 

- MPSE approach for accurate state estimation by prioritizing pertinent observations 

- Planning strategy tailored for time-varying transitions to optimize policy

- Validation in simulations and hardware experiments demonstrating superiority over standard POMDP methods

The proposed techniques enable more effective decision-making and control in dynamic, uncertain environments by integrating capabilities to handle time-variation, partial observability and stochasticity.
