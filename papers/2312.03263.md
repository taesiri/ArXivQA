# [Weathering Ongoing Uncertainty: Learning and Planning in a Time-Varying   Partially Observable Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03263)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new framework called Time-Varying Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (TV-POMDPs) to model decision-making under uncertainty in environments that change over time. A key challenge is that past experiences can become obsolete under time-variation. To address this, the authors propose Memory Prioritized State Estimation (MPSE) which selectively prioritizes pertinent historical observations alongside new data to optimize state estimation accuracy. This leverages the insight that in gradually changing environments, old experiences still hold relevance. An associated planning strategy is also presented that exploits the modeled time-varying transitions for optimizing action selection. The authors validate the approach through marine robot simulations and ground robot experiments involving navigation in uncertain, stochastic settings. Results demonstrate MPSE's ability to balance retaining prior learning versus acquiring new samples for swift adaptation. This facilitates superior performance compared to methods relying solely on recent observations. By continuously recalibrating the balance between past and present, MPSE enables resilient planning despite unpredictable changes over time. The integrated framework successfully tackles core limitations in prevailing approaches to enhance autonomous decision-making under partial observability, stochasticity and time-variation.
