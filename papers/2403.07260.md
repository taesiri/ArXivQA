# [CKERC : Joint Large Language Models with Commonsense Knowledge for   Emotion Recognition in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07260)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) is challenging as it depends on dialog context, speaker identity, multi-party scenarios etc. Prior work has limitations in mining speaker information and fails to leverage commonsense knowledge that captures reactions of listeners and intentions of the speaker. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes CKERC, a joint framework of large language models with commonsense knowledge for ERC. It generates commonsense about potential listeners' reactions and speaker's intentions using historical utterances and LLMs. It replaces speaker identification with speaker commonsense identification to deeply explore speaker implicit information.  

Key Contributions:
- Introduces commonsense knowledge to ERC to address inadequate mining of speaker information  
- Generates speaker commonsense based on historical conversations using LLMs
- Replaces speaker identification with speaker commonsense identification and pretrains LM for this task before ERC
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods like InstructERC on IEMOCAP, EmoryNLP and MELD datasets

In summary, this paper advances ERC by generating speaker commonsense from conversation history with LLMs and using it to enhance speaker modeling, achieving new state-of-the-art results on multiple ERC benchmarks. The introduced commonsense better captures reactions and intentions to help recognize emotions.
