# [Planning and Rendering: Towards End-to-End Product Poster Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08822)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes P&R, a novel end-to-end framework for generating product poster images that effectively convey product information. The key innovation is modeling the workflow of human designers, which consists of a planning stage to generate the layout, and a rendering stage to create the final poster image. In the planning stage, the PlanNet predicts a rational and flexible layout based on both the visual features of the product image and semantic features of the text descriptions. This facilitates better placement of elements in the final poster. In the rendering stage, the RenderNet generates a visually pleasing background that matches the style of the product, while considering the layout information to reserve space for the visual components. To train and benchmark methods, the authors construct the first large-scale dataset PPG30k comprising 30k product poster images with comprehensive annotations. Experiments demonstrate that P&R outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in layout prediction and image generation quality. The new dataset and effective framework significantly advance research towards automating the poster design process.
