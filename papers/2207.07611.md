# [Position Prediction as an Effective Pretraining Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07611)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the provided abstract, this paper proposes a novel pretraining strategy called "Position Prediction as an Effective Pretraining Strategy" for transformers in computer vision and speech recognition tasks. The key ideas are:

- Instead of reconstructing masked image patches or speech frames like in MAE or BERT, they propose to predict the positions of masked patches/frames based only on their content. This forces the model to learn about relationships between different parts of the input.

- They formulate it as a classification task among all possible positions for each masked patch/frame. 

- This approach does not require reconstructing dense outputs like images or speech.

- They show this pretraining strategy brings improvements over strong baselines in image classification on CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet-1K, as well as a speech command classification task.

- Their method enables transformers without position embeddings to outperform ones trained with position information, suggesting much of the transformer's power lies in modeling co-occurrence of input tokens.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that position prediction based on content is an effective pretraining strategy for transformers in computer vision and speech tasks, even without using position embeddings. The key advantage is bypassing reconstruction while still learning relationships between different parts of the input.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, the main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a novel unsupervised pretraining technique for Transformers called Masked Patch Position Prediction (MP3). The key ideas are:

- Instead of reconstructing masked input tokens like in BERT and MAE, MP3 removes the positional information of input tokens and trains the model to predict the position of each token. 

- This forces the model to learn about relationships between different parts of the input from the content alone, without relying on their positions. 

- MP3 only uses a simple cross-entropy loss on predicted token positions, avoiding more complex reconstruction losses.

- Experiments on vision and speech benchmarks show MP3 improves over supervised baselines and matches performance of other unsupervised methods like MAE, despite its simplicity. 

- Remarkably, MP3 enables strong performance even without using positional embeddings, sometimes outperforming models trained with full position information.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing MP3 as an effective and simple alternative to reconstruction-based pretraining like BERT and MAE, where the model learns by predicting token positions instead of reconstructing token values.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised pretraining method for Transformers where the model predicts patch positions from content alone, without relying on reconstructing dense patch values like in autoencoder-based methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper proposes a novel pretraining strategy called Masked Patch Position Prediction (MP3) for Transformers. It is related to other self-supervised pretraining methods like BERT, BEiT, and MAE, but differs in masking out positional information rather than input tokens. 

- The idea of predicting order/position for self-supervised learning has been explored before in computer vision, but mostly with CNN encoders and for learning local representations. MP3 focuses on learning global representations with Transformers.

- MP3 is related to methods that train Transformers without explicit positional embeddings (e.g. nopos), but shows this can be highly effective when combined with the proposed pretraining task.

- Contrastive self-supervised learning methods like MoCo and DINO differ from MP3 in their use of data augmentation and enforcing clustering in the representation space. MP3 does not rely on augmentation or clustering.

- Concurrent work in NLP has also looked at predicting position for BERT pretraining, but MP3 explores this in both vision and speech.

- Overall, MP3 presents a simple yet surprisingly effective self-supervised pretraining approach for Transformers. While the idea is intuitive, the results demonstrate the power of this pretext task and the ability of Transformers to capture positional relationships from content alone. The comparisons validate MP3 against competitive baselines.

In summary, this paper explores a novel angle for self-supervised learning that is related to but distinct from prior work. The simplicity yet strong results make it a valuable contribution, especially in demonstrating the potential of position prediction for Transformers in both vision and speech.
