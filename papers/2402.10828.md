# [RAG-Driver: Generalisable Driving Explanations with Retrieval-Augmented   In-Context Learning in Multi-Modal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10828)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainability and generalizability are major challenges for autonomous driving systems powered by blackbox models. Explainability is key to build trust and transparency, while generalizability to new environments without retraining is crucial for practical deployment. However, existing methods struggle with these due to data scarcity, domain gaps across datasets, prohibitively expensive model retraining, and catastrophic forgetting.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes RAG-Driver, a novel retrieval-augmented multi-modal large language model (MLLM) that leverages in-context learning to achieve explainable and generalizable driving. It has three capabilities: 
1) Generate natural language explanations of driving actions 
2) Justify the rationale behind actions
3) Predict low-level control signals (speed, steering angle)
The key novelty is a retrieval mechanism that searches a memory bank to find driving experiences similar to the current scenario. These retrieved examples are used to augment MLLM predictions via in-context learning without parameter updates. This boosts performance and generalizability.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes a new retrieval-augmented in-context learning method tailored for MLLMs in driving applications
2) Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating introspective explanations on the BDD-X benchmark
3) Demonstrates exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen environments without any model retraining or fine-tuning

In summary, RAG-Driver advances MLLM-based approaches for explainable and generalizable driving through a novel retrieval-augmented in-context learning paradigm. Without expensive retraining, it adapts to new environments by leveraging experiences similar to the current scenario as contextual demonstrations for the model.
