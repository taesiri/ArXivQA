# [Novel definition and quantitative analysis of branch structure with   topological data analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for quantitatively analyzing branch-like structures in images rely on subjective judgments of what constitutes a "branch". This makes it difficult to objectively compare different structures.
- The problem is especially difficult for images comprising discrete particles rather than connected branches.
- There is a need for an objective framework to quantitatively analyze branch structures. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using topological data analysis, specifically persistent homology, to mathematically define "internal" and "external" branch structures. 
- Points are plotted on the convex hull of the image. 
- Two persistence diagrams are generated - one from the original image, one from the image with convex hull points. 
- The intersection of the two diagrams represents internal structures, unchanged by the convex hull points.
- The difference between the two diagrams represents external structures, detected only after adding convex hull points.

Main Contributions:
- Provides an objective, quantitative framework for analyzing branch-like structures in images.
- Mathematically defines internal and external branch structures based on topological data analysis. 
- Develops mathematical theories characterizing how internal and external structures change with different convex hull point settings.
- Applies the method to analyze lymph vessel, neuron, and blood vessel images as examples.
- Shows the framework can enable spatial, positional and size analyses of branches.
- Introduces generalized persistence landscapes as a tool for further topological analysis.

In summary, the key innovation is using topological data analysis to objectively define and quantitatively analyze branch structures in images in a way not reliant on subjective judgments. Both theoretical properties and practical applications are demonstrated.
