# [Mesh-based Gaussian Splatting for Real-time Large-scale Deformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Implicit 3D representations like neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can reconstruct high-quality 3D scenes from images, but struggle with real-time rendering and editing capabilities. Discrete representations like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) enable real-time rendering via efficient splatting, but cannot handle large-scale deformation well due to the lack of topology information to guide the manipulation of individual Gaussians. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel mesh-based Gaussian splatting representation that binds an explicit mesh with the 3D Gaussians. The mesh provides topological guidance during Gaussian learning to eliminate poorly shaped Gaussians via face split and normal guidance operations. This results in higher quality novel view synthesis compared to vanilla 3DGS. For deformation, the mesh deformation gradients are transferred to the bound Gaussians to achieve large-scale deformation while avoiding artifacts. A regularization loss also constrains Gaussian shapes.

Main Contributions:
- A mesh-based Gaussian splatting representation that uses the mesh to guide Gaussian learning and splitting. This enhances quality and avoids artifacts.
- Face split and normal guidance strategies to constrain and split Gaussians during learning based on the mesh topology. 
- A large-scale Gaussian deformation method that transfers mesh deformation gradients to bound Gaussians for real-time deformation while preserving quality.
- A regularization loss to prevent extreme Gaussian anisotropies that cause deformation artifacts.
- Higher quality novel view synthesis than vanilla 3DGS, and real-time large-scale deformation unmatched by prior Gaussian methods.

The key insight is binding the mesh and Gaussians so the mesh can provide topological guidance to enhance Gaussian learning, quality, and deformation robustness. Evaluations show state-of-the-art deformation capability with real-time rendering.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel mesh-based Gaussian splatting representation that enables large-scale deformation of 3D Gaussian splatting in real-time. Specifically:

1) They propose a mesh-based Gaussian splatting representation that binds 3D Gaussians with an explicit mesh. The mesh guides the learning and splitting of Gaussians to improve quality and prevent artifacts during deformation.

2) They introduce a large-scale Gaussian deformation technique based on this representation. It alters the parameters of Gaussians according to the manipulation of the associated mesh, enabling real-time deformation of 3D Gaussian splatting. 

3) They design an interactive tool that allows for real-time Gaussian manipulation and high-quality splatting rendering with user-friendly constraints.

4) Experiments show their method achieves higher-quality reconstruction and effective deformation compared to alternatives, while maintaining real-time performance.

In summary, the key innovation is the mesh-based Gaussian splatting representation and associated deformation technique that enables real-time, large-scale deformation of 3D Gaussian splatting.

The paper proposes a novel mesh-based Gaussian splatting representation to enable large-scale deformation of 3D Gaussian splatting in real-time. It utilizes explicit mesh guidance with strategies like face split and normal guidance to regularize the Gaussian distribution learning. This mesh-based representation then allows deforming the Gaussians interactively in real-time by applying mesh deformation techniques on the associated mesh. The goal is to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis along with effective large-scale deformation capabilities. So the key focus areas are around mesh-based Gaussian splatting, mesh-guided learning, interactive real-time deformation, and data-driven approaches for deformation.
