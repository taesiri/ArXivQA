# [Improving Sample Quality of Diffusion Models Using Self-Attention   Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00939)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve the sample quality of diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT in an unconditional setting without using external guidance signals like class labels or text prompts?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Intermediate representations and self-attention maps within diffusion models contain useful internal guidance signals that can be exploited to improve sample quality. 

2) Adversarially masking and blurring regions that the model attends to, as indicated by the self-attention maps, and using the residual signals for guidance can enhance model stability and sample quality without external signals.

So in summary, the main research direction is developing unconditional, internal self-guidance techniques to boost diffusion model sample quality, with a focus on using self-attention maps to guide which regions to mask/blur. The key hypothesis is that the internal signals from self-attention provide useful implicit guidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Presenting a generalized formulation of diffusion guidance that can utilize internal information within diffusion models to guide the image generation process. This allows diffusion guidance to be applied in unconditional settings without external inputs like class labels.

- Introducing a new guidance method called Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) that uses the internal self-attention maps of diffusion models to guide the image generation. SAG blurrs regions that the model attends to and uses the blurred information to guide the model.

- Demonstrating that SAG improves sample quality across various diffusion models including ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT. The method does not require retraining the models.

- Showing that SAG can be combined with existing conditional guidance techniques like classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance to achieve further improvements.

- Providing ablation studies and analyses to validate the design choices and effectiveness of the proposed SAG method.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a new way to guide diffusion models using their internal self-attention maps, which provides sample quality improvements without needing external conditions or retraining the models. The self-attention guidance technique is shown to be broadly applicable across various diffusion models.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in denoising diffusion models:

- The key contribution of the paper is proposing a new self-attention guidance (SAG) method to improve sample quality from diffusion models without needing additional labels or training. This builds off prior work on classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance, but generalizes the notion of guidance to be condition-free. 

- SAG is able to improve sample quality across a range of diffusion models including ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT. This demonstrates the broad applicability of the approach. Prior guidance techniques like classifier guidance were model-specific.

- The paper shows SAG can be combined with existing conditional guidance techniques like classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance to achieve further improvements. This highlights the orthogonality and flexibility of SAG.

- The core idea of using the self-attention maps to selectively blur image regions for guidance is novel. Prior work has not explored using the internal self-attention maps of diffusion models for guiding the sampling process.

- The visual results demonstrate noticeable qualitative improvements in sample quality when using SAG, especially in reducing artifact levels. The paper also provides extensive quantitative experiments to back up the benefits.

- The approach does have some limitations such as increased compute requirements compared to no guidance, and reduced sample diversity in some cases. But overall it makes an important contribution in improving the sample quality of diffusion models in a generalizable way.

In summary, the paper introduces a new condition-free guidance technique for diffusion models that leverages self-attention maps, demonstrates effectiveness across various models, and compares favorably to prior conditional guidance techniques. The core idea and results are novel and impactful in this research field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different masking strategies for the self-attention guidance, beyond just thresholding the attention maps. They suggest trying learned or more adaptive masks.

- Applying self-attention guidance to discrete diffusion models that directly model token probabilities. The authors state this could be an interesting direction for future work.

- Distilling the self-attention guidance into the model weights so it doesn't require additional sampling steps. This could reduce the computational overhead.

- Combining self-attention guidance with other conditional guidance techniques like classifier guidance or text-to-image guidance. The authors show promising results combining self-attention and classifier guidance.

- Generalizing the self-attention guidance framework to other generative models besides diffusion models, like GANs. The key idea of using a model's internal representations to guide sampling could apply more broadly.

- Evaluating the effects of self-attention guidance on sample diversity and novelty, in addition to just sample quality. The authors note this is an important consideration.

- Exploring other types of internal guidance beyond self-attention, using different model components like convolutional features.

So in summary, the key future directions relate to improving, generalizing, and analyzing self-attention guidance, reducing its computational overhead, and exploring other types of internal generative model guidance. The core idea of leveraging a model's own representations to improve sampling is identified as very promising.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method to improve the sample quality of diffusion models without relying on external guidance such as class labels or text prompts. The key idea is to use the self-attention maps generated by the diffusion model itself during sampling to guide the model internally. Specifically, the model blurs image regions that it is attending to, then uses the blurred image to make predictions. The discrepancy between the predictions on the original and blurred images acts as an internal guidance signal to enhance sample quality. This Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) approach is shown to improve sample quality across different diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT. A key benefit is that it does not require retraining the models. Experiments demonstrate SAG's effectiveness and orthogonality to existing conditional guidance techniques. Overall, the proposed self-conditioning approach expands the applicability of diffusion guidance in a training- and condition-free manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) to improve the sample quality of diffusion models without requiring additional training or external conditions like class labels. Diffusion models like DDPM generate images by iteratively adding noise and then denoising. Recent methods use guidance techniques that rely on class labels to help the model generate higher quality samples. SAG instead utilizes the internal self-attention maps of diffusion models to guide the image generation process. Specifically, it blurs image regions that the model is attending to based on the self-attention maps, and uses the blurred images to guide the model's predictions. This allows SAG to improve sample quality without external conditions or re-training.

Experiments show SAG improves sample quality across diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT. It also combines well with existing guidance techniques like classifier guidance to further boost performance. Ablation studies validate the design choices like using self-attention for blurring. The self-attention maps help SAG focus on salient image regions unlike global blurring. Overall, SAG provides a new way to improve diffusion models using internal representations, broadening guidance beyond just external conditions. The results demonstrate the promise of utilizing internal model representations to guide and improve generative models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) to improve the sample quality of diffusion models without needing additional training or external conditions like class labels. 

The key idea is to use the internal self-attention maps of diffusion models to guide the sampling process. Specifically, SAG blurs the regions that the model attends to, concealing salient details. It then uses the difference between the original and blurred images to guide the model to enhance these attended regions. 

During sampling, SAG computes the self-attention map of the current sample. It then selectively blurs only the highly-attended regions based on a threshold. The original and blurred samples are combined and diffused again. The model is guided using the difference to recover the blurred content. This adversarial blurring of attended regions allows SAG to boost quality without external supervision.

Experiments on diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT show SAG consistently improves sample quality. SAG also combines well with existing conditional guidance methods. Ablations validate the design choices like using self-attention for blurring. Thus, SAG provides an effective way to self-condition diffusion models on internal representations to generate better samples.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It presents a more general formulation of diffusion guidance that can utilize internal information within diffusion models to improve sample quality, instead of relying solely on external conditions like class labels or text prompts. 

- It proposes two new condition-free guidance techniques based on this formulation - blur guidance and self-attention guidance (SAG):

- Blur guidance intentionally blurs intermediate reconstructions to guide diffusion models using the removed information. However, it can introduce ambiguity with large guidance scales.

- SAG uses the intermediate self-attention maps of diffusion models to selectively blur attended regions and guide models with the excluded information. This enhances stability and sample quality without external conditions.

- SAG is shown to improve various diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT in unconditional and class-conditional settings.

- SAG can be combined with existing conditional guidance like classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance for further improvements, showing orthogonality.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a generalized perspective on diffusion guidance and using it to develop effective condition-free techniques like SAG that can boost performance of pre-trained diffusion models without additional training or labels.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Self-Attention Guidance (SAG), a novel method to improve sample quality from diffusion models without requiring external labels or additional training. The key idea is to leverage the internal self-attention maps that diffusion models already produce during generation. Specifically, SAG applies adversarial blurring only on image regions that the model attends to based on the attention map.
