# [Improving Sample Quality of Diffusion Models Using Self-Attention   Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00939)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve the sample quality of diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT in an unconditional setting without using external guidance signals like class labels or text prompts?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Intermediate representations and self-attention maps within diffusion models contain useful internal guidance signals that can be exploited to improve sample quality. 

2) Adversarially masking and blurring regions that the model attends to, as indicated by the self-attention maps, and using the residual signals for guidance can enhance model stability and sample quality without external signals.

So in summary, the main research direction is developing unconditional, internal self-guidance techniques to boost diffusion model sample quality, with a focus on using self-attention maps to guide which regions to mask/blur. The key hypothesis is that the internal signals from self-attention provide useful implicit guidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Presenting a generalized formulation of diffusion guidance that can utilize internal information within diffusion models to guide the image generation process. This allows diffusion guidance to be applied in unconditional settings without external inputs like class labels.

- Introducing a new guidance method called Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) that uses the internal self-attention maps of diffusion models to guide the image generation. SAG blurrs regions that the model attends to and uses the blurred information to guide the model.

- Demonstrating that SAG improves sample quality across various diffusion models including ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT. The method does not require retraining the models.

- Showing that SAG can be combined with existing conditional guidance techniques like classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance to achieve further improvements.

- Providing ablation studies and analyses to validate the design choices and effectiveness of the proposed SAG method.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a new way to guide diffusion models using their internal self-attention maps, which provides sample quality improvements without needing external conditions or retraining the models. The self-attention guidance technique is shown to be broadly applicable across various diffusion models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) to improve the sample quality of diffusion models like DDPM without needing additional training or external guidance signals like class labels.
