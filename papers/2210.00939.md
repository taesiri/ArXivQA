# [Improving Sample Quality of Diffusion Models Using Self-Attention   Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00939)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve the sample quality of diffusion models like ADM, IDDPM, Stable Diffusion, and DiT in an unconditional setting without using external guidance signals like class labels or text prompts?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Intermediate representations and self-attention maps within diffusion models contain useful internal guidance signals that can be exploited to improve sample quality. 

2) Adversarially masking and blurring regions that the model attends to, as indicated by the self-attention maps, and using the residual signals for guidance can enhance model stability and sample quality without external signals.

So in summary, the main research direction is developing unconditional, internal self-guidance techniques to boost diffusion model sample quality, with a focus on using self-attention maps to guide which regions to mask/blur. The key hypothesis is that the internal signals from self-attention provide useful implicit guidance.
