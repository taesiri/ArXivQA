# [Tell Me What You See: Text-Guided Real-World Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image acquisition in low light conditions is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Existing methods for image denoising and reconstruction rely on modeling the statistics of natural images and noise, which is not enough under very low lighting.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method to use a text description/caption of the captured scene as additional prior information to aid image reconstruction under low lighting conditions. 
- A text-conditioned diffusion model is presented which takes the noisy raw image and corresponding text caption as input to generate the clean reconstructed raw image. 
- The model is first trained on simulated noisy and clean image pairs from the COCO dataset. The text captions are encoded into vectors using CLIP.
- A camera-specific fine-tuning method called LORA is used with real captures to adapt the model to true noise statistics.

Main Contributions:
- A text-conditioned diffusion model for low-light raw image reconstruction which significantly improves results by leveraging scene descriptions.
- A training pipeline involving simulated data and real-world noise fine-tuning for the model. 
- Superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to non-text-conditioned diffusion and other methods on both synthetic and real test data.
- The idea of integrating textual scene information from the photographer along with image processing algorithms to push boundaries of imaging.

In summary, the paper presents a novel text-guided diffusion model to effectively reconstruct low-light raw images by exploiting the additional textual scene description as a prior. A complete framework involving training on simulated and real-world data is provided.
