# DuRecDial 2.0: A Bilingual Parallel Corpus for Conversational   Recommendation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we create a bilingual parallel dataset to facilitate research on multilingual and cross-lingual conversational recommendation?The authors aim to create a new dataset called DuRecDial 2.0 that contains dialogues aligned across English and Chinese. This is intended to enable studies on multilingual and cross-lingual techniques for conversational recommendation systems.The key contributions seem to be:- Creation of DuRecDial 2.0, a large-scale bilingual parallel dialog dataset for conversational recommendation research. - Definition of monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual tasks using this new dataset.- Development of baseline models for the defined tasks to benchmark performance.- Analysis of results showing the benefits of the bilingual data for Chinese conversational recommendation.So in summary, the core research contribution is the creation of a novel bilingual dataset to facilitate new research directions in multilingual and cross-lingual conversational recommendation systems. The authors demonstrate the value of the dataset by defining relevant tasks, building baselines, and showing performance improvements from bilingual training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new bilingual parallel dataset, DuRecDial 2.0, for conversational recommendation. This is the first publicly available parallel dataset in English and Chinese for this task. 2. It defines 5 tasks on this dataset - monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual conversational recommendation. This allows for exploring new research directions.3. It provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset, comparing it to existing datasets and showing its benefits. The analysis indicates the dataset has good diversity and parallelism.4. It establishes strong baselines for the tasks using state-of-the-art models XNLG and mBART. Experiments show benefits of using the bilingual dataset, especially for improving Chinese conversational recommendation.5. The dataset and experiments provide a challenging testbed to drive future research on monolingual, multilingual and cross-lingual conversational recommendation.In summary, the key contribution is creating a high-quality bilingual dataset for conversational recommendation, defining new tasks on it, analyzing its properties, establishing baselines, and showing the benefits it provides for improving Chinese conversational recommendation. The dataset enables new research directions in this space.
