# [ARTIC3D: Learning Robust Articulated 3D Shapes from Noisy Web Image   Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04619)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we reconstruct high-quality 3D articulated animal shapes and textures from sparse and noisy web image collections, without relying on any 3D shape templates or per-image annotations like keypoints or camera viewpoints?The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing ARTIC3D, a novel diffusion-guided optimization framework to estimate 3D articulated shape and texture from sparse in-the-wild images.- Using a skeleton-based surface representation that enables explicit part manipulation and realistic animation.- Designing a Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) module to efficiently incorporate 2D diffusion priors into the 3D optimization process.- Preprocessing noisy input images via diffusion models to obtain cleaner silhouettes and features.- Jointly optimizing camera, pose, shape, and texture to reconstruct details faithful to input images. - Introducing animation fine-tuning strategies to improve shape and texture coherence across frames.- Evaluating on PASCAL-Part, LASSIE, and a new extended LASSIE dataset with occluded images to demonstrate ARTIC3D can produce more robust and higher-quality 3D outputs compared to prior arts.In summary, the key hypothesis is that leveraging 2D diffusion priors can enable reconstructing high-fidelity 3D articulated shapes from sparse noisy image collections, without relying on 3D supervision or per-image annotations. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis.
