# [ARTIC3D: Learning Robust Articulated 3D Shapes from Noisy Web Image   Collections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04619)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we reconstruct high-quality 3D articulated animal shapes and textures from sparse and noisy web image collections, without relying on any 3D shape templates or per-image annotations like keypoints or camera viewpoints?The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposing ARTIC3D, a novel diffusion-guided optimization framework to estimate 3D articulated shape and texture from sparse in-the-wild images.- Using a skeleton-based surface representation that enables explicit part manipulation and realistic animation.- Designing a Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) module to efficiently incorporate 2D diffusion priors into the 3D optimization process.- Preprocessing noisy input images via diffusion models to obtain cleaner silhouettes and features.- Jointly optimizing camera, pose, shape, and texture to reconstruct details faithful to input images. - Introducing animation fine-tuning strategies to improve shape and texture coherence across frames.- Evaluating on PASCAL-Part, LASSIE, and a new extended LASSIE dataset with occluded images to demonstrate ARTIC3D can produce more robust and higher-quality 3D outputs compared to prior arts.In summary, the key hypothesis is that leveraging 2D diffusion priors can enable reconstructing high-fidelity 3D articulated shapes from sparse noisy image collections, without relying on 3D supervision or per-image annotations. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents ARTIC3D, a framework for reconstructing articulated 3D animal shapes and textures from sparse and noisy image collections without 3D supervision. The main contributions are:- Proposes a novel Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) module to efficiently incorporate 2D diffusion priors into 3D surface optimization. DASS provides cleaner gradients compared to backpropagating through the latent encoder. - Uses DASS for input image preprocessing to deal with occlusions/truncation, shape/texture optimization, and animation fine-tuning for temporal consistency.- Achieves robust 3D reconstruction on a new E-LASSIE dataset with occluded web images, producing shapes and textures that are more detailed and faithful to the inputs compared to prior works.  - Enables applications like high-quality 3D animation and texture transfer by representing the 3D surface with articulated parts.Overall, the key insight is to leverage recent advances in 2D generative diffusion models to supervise the 3D optimization process for articulated animal shapes from challenging sparse image collections. The proposed strategies help produce shapes that are robust, detailed, realistic, and animatable.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in articulated 3D shape reconstruction from images:- This paper tackles a very challenging problem of reconstructing detailed 3D articulated animal shapes from only sparse, noisy web image collections, without access to 3D data or dense multi-view imagery. Most prior work relies on large-scale supervised training data or cleaner images.- The method builds on top of recent skeleton-based reconstruction approaches like Hi-LASSIE, but makes several key contributions to improve shape, texture, and robustness to noisy inputs using ideas from diffusion models.- The use of diffusion models for 3D shape optimization is inspired by recent works like DreamFusion and Latent-NeRF, but the proposed Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) provides a more efficient and stable way to leverage 2D diffusion priors for 3D.- The paper demonstrates significantly improved quantitative and qualitative results compared to optimization-based baselines, especially on the newly collected noisy images. The learned models also enable controllable synthesis like texture transfer and realistic articulated animations.- Compared to concurrent learning-based approaches like MagicPony and Farm3D, this approach does not require large-scale training data and can reconstruct per-instance shapes. However, the optimization process is slower than feedforward neural networks.- A limitation is the reliance on skeleton initialization, which can fail for highly occluded images. The diffusion model bias can also cause artifacts.Overall, I think this paper makes excellent contributions in leveraging 2D priors for robust 3D shape learning from limited noisy image data. The problem setting and techniques seem quite unique compared to other concurrent works. The results are highly compelling and demonstrate clear advantages over optimization-based baselines.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending ARTIC3D to more general articulated objects beyond just animal shapes. The current method focuses on animals, but the overall framework could potentially be applied to other articulated categories like humans, robots, etc. - Improving skeleton discovery for animals with ambiguous skeletal structure like sheep. The skeleton initialization is important for the part-based representation in ARTIC3D. Better handling of tricky cases like fluffy animals could further improve results.- Mitigating front-facing bias in diffusion models. The paper notes that the bias in diffusion models toward front views sometimes leads to unrealistic textures or shapes in the 3D reconstructions. Exploring ways to reduce this bias could improve results.- Leveraging more advanced diffusion models as they continue to develop. Using more capable generative models as priors could potentially improve the quality and robustness of the 3D reconstructions and animations.- Exploring self-supervised strategies for camera pose estimation. The current method relies on optimizing the camera poses, but learning to predict viewpoints could be useful.- Evaluating on a diverse dataset with ground truth 3D annotations. The lack of 3D supervision currently limits quantitative evaluation. A more comprehensive benchmark could better analyze the 3D accuracy.In summary, the main future directions are: enhancing the framework to handle more general articulated categories, improving the skeleton initialization for difficult cases, reducing diffusion model bias, incorporating advances in diffusion models, self-supervised camera prediction, and quantitative evaluation on diverse 3D datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes ARTIC3D, a framework for learning robust 3D articulated shapes of animals from sparse and noisy image collections scraped from the internet. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in 2D image generation using diffusion models as a strong prior to guide the 3D shape reconstruction. Specifically, the paper introduces a novel Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) module that can effectively incorporate the 2D diffusion prior into various stages of the 3D optimization pipeline, including input image enhancement, shape and texture optimization, and animation fine-tuning. DASS provides more stable gradients compared to prior score distillation techniques. The framework represents the 3D shape using an articulated skeleton and deformable part surfaces, which allows explicit part manipulation for animation. Experiments on animal image datasets, including a newly introduced challenging set with occluded images, demonstrate ARTIC3D's ability to reconstruct high quality 3D shapes that are robust, detailed, and animatable compared to previous optimization-based techniques. The method does not require 3D supervision or image annotations. Key applications like pose and texture transfer are also presented.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes ARTIC3D, a framework for learning robust 3D articulated shapes from sparse and noisy web image collections. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in 2D image diffusion models as priors to guide the 3D shape optimization process. First, the paper represents the 3D articulated shape using a skeleton-based surface parameterization, which enables explicit part manipulation for animation. To handle noisy input images, they use a novel Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) module to clean up the images before optimization. DASS accumulates gradients from the diffusion model decoder over multiple denoising steps, which is shown to be more stable than backpropagating encoder gradients. For shape and texture optimization, DASS is used to distill multi-view renders into realistic images. They also propose techniques like pose exploration and animation fine-tuning to improve reconstruction and animation quality. Experiments on animal image datasets, including a newly collected set of noisy web images, demonstrate the robustness of ARTIC3D to imperfect observations. The results also show more detailed shape and texture compared to prior works.In summary, the key contribution is a framework to leverage recent advances in 2D diffusion models to guide 3D articulated shape reconstruction from sparse noisy image collections without ground truth 3D or 2D supervision. The experiments validate the robustness and improved visual quality over baseline methods.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes ARTIC3D, a framework for learning robust 3D articulated animal shapes from sparse and noisy web image collections. The key idea is to leverage powerful 2D diffusion priors from models like Stable Diffusion to guide the 3D shape optimization. Specifically, the input images are enhanced via diffusion models to obtain cleaner masks and features. Then, a novel Decoder-based Accumulative Score Sampling (DASS) module is proposed to efficiently compute image-level gradients from the diffusion model to supervise the 3D shape and texture optimization. This avoids directly backpropagating noisy gradients from the latent space as in prior work. Further, the initial 3D articulated shape is refined with pose exploration and animation fine-tuning using temporal consistency losses on the latent codes. Experiments on PASCAL and LASSIE datasets, including a newly collected set of noisy web images, demonstrate ARTC3D produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that are more detailed, faithful to inputs, and robust to occlusions compared to optimization-based baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the authors are addressing the problem of reconstructing 3D articulated shapes and textures from sparse, noisy image collections of animals in the wild. The key challenges include:- Ambiguities due to variations in camera viewpoint, lighting, pose, shape, and texture across the sparse input images.- Lack of ground truth 3D shapes or multi-view annotations like camera poses or 2D keypoints. - Noisy inputs like occlusions, truncations, and ambiguous textures that make reconstructing a complete and realistic 3D model difficult.Their key idea is to leverage recent advances in 2D generative diffusion models as priors to guide the 3D shape and texture optimization process. Specifically, they propose a framework called ARTIC3D that:- Uses a skeleton-based surface representation to enable part-based articulation and animation.- Preprocesses input images via diffusion models to fill in missing regions. - Jointly optimizes camera, pose, shape and texture guided by losses like silhouette, semantics, as well as a novel decoder-based diffusion loss.- Fine-tunes the articulated animation using temporal regularization in the latent space.In summary, the paper aims to address the challenging problem of reconstructing animatable 3D animal models from sparse, in-the-wild image collections by effectively incorporating 2D diffusion model priors to handle ambiguity and noise. The proposed ARTIC3D framework demonstrates improved shape, texture, and animation quality compared to prior arts.
