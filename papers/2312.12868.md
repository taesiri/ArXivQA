# [Towards Machines that Trust: AI Agents Learn to Trust in the Trust Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of gaining an understanding of the emergence of trust in behavioral interactions, using the "trust game" as an experimental paradigm. The trust game involves two players - a Trustor and a Trustee. The Trustor is given an endowment and has to decide how much of it to transfer to the Trustee. The transferred amount is multiplied and the Trustee then decides how much of that multiplied amount to return back to the Trustor. The game aims to study trusting behavior.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the optimal strategy for the Trustor in the trust game, under certain assumptions about the probability and amount that the Trustee returns. It shows mathematically that if the expected return from the Trustee is greater than 1, the Trustor should transfer their entire endowment (maximum trust), while if the expected return is less than 1, the Trustor should not transfer anything (no trust). The analysis provides a basis for emergence of trust. The paper also uses reinforcement learning to simulate Trustors that learn the optimal policy over interactions with Trustee agents that behave according to the theoretical assumptions.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a mathematical analysis of the optimal trusting behavior for the Trustor in the trust game paradigm, formally analyzing the conditions under which maximum vs zero trust emerges.
- Corroborates the theoretical analysis by simulating reinforcement learning agents that learn to exhibit the theoretically optimal trusting behavior through interactions with Trustee agents.
- Shows that using simulated interactions for training agents makes the process safer, cheaper and faster compared to alternatives like human subject experiments.
- Extends prior work by the authors on interactive multi-agent simulations for studying human behavior.

The paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions towards understanding the emergence of trust in human interactions using computational agents. The combined theoretical and simulation-based approach is the main strength.
