# [The Butterfly Effect of Altering Prompts: How Small Changes and   Jailbreaks Affect Large Language Model Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper explores how sensitive large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are to minor variations in the prompts provided to them. Specifically, it studies three types of prompt variations:

1. Output format specifications: Asking the LLM to provide outputs in formats like JSON, CSV, XML, etc. 
2. Perturbations: Minor changes to the prompt like adding spaces, greetings, thanking the LLM, rephrasing questions as statements, etc.
3. Jailbreaks: Methods to bypass the LLM's content filtering systems to allow responses to sensitive topics. 

The core research question is - do these semantic-preserving prompt variations affect the LLM's predictions?

Proposed Solution 
The paper conducts experiments by applying these prompt variations to ChatGPT across 11 text classification tasks. For each variation, it measures:

1. Number of times the LLM changes its prediction
2. Impact on the LLM's accuracy
3. Similarity of predictions across variations using dimensionality reduction
4. Correlation between prediction changes and human annotator disagreements

Key Findings
The key findings from the experiments are:

1. All types of prompt variations lead to a significant number of prediction changes. Even minor perturbations like adding spaces can change hundreds of predictions.

2. Accuracy impacts vary across tasks for different formats. Overall, JSON, Python List and no format specifications work best. Jailbreaks lead to substantial accuracy drops.

3. Predictions from perturbations stay similar while formats and jailbreaks make predictions diverge. Tipping amounts display a linear relationship.

4. Instances with higher human disagreements are slightly more likely to change but confusion alone doesn't fully explain the changes.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations which should be considered while using them for production tasks. Future work includes making models more robust to these changes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper explores how small variations in prompts, like output format specifications, minor perturbations, and common "jailbreaks", significantly impact the predictions and accuracy of large language models on text classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is an analysis of how minor variations in the way a prompt is constructed can affect the predictions and accuracy of large language models like ChatGPT. Specifically, the authors explore variations in output format specifications (e.g. JSON, CSV), small perturbations to the wording of prompts (adding spaces, greetings, etc.), the use of "jailbreaks" to bypass content filtering, and offering tips. 

They find that even small prompt changes can lead to a significant number of prediction changes - over 10% in some cases. However, accuracy is generally still comparable across variations, with some exceptions like jailbreaks which hurt performance more substantially. The authors also analyze the similarity of predictions across variations using multidimensional scaling, finding formats cluster together while jailbreaks are further apart. Finally, they explore if prediction changes correlate with human annotator disagreement, finding a slight correlation but other factors also at play.

In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous analysis quantifying how sensitive large language model predictions are to minor prompt variations, across a range of benchmark classification tasks. This highlights the difficulty of prompt engineering and the instability of these models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How did the authors generate the different prompt variations tested in the study? What considerations went into designing variations like added spaces, output formats, jailbreaks etc.?

2. The study tested ChatGPT specifically. Do you think the results would generalize to other large language models? What differences might be expected?

3. The results showed changes in predictions due to prompt variations, but what might be the underlying reasons or mechanisms inside the model causing this variability? 

4. The model predictions changed but overall accuracy did not vary much across prompt variations except for jailbreaks. Why would overall accuracy remain stable despite changes in individual predictions?

5. How sensitive do you expect future iterations of large language models like ChatGPT to be regarding prompt variations? Could techniques like prompt ensembling help mitigate this sensitivity?  

6. For the output formats tested, why did formats like XML and CSV lead to bigger accuracy drops compared to Python list? Does the structure/syntax of formats impact internal model representations?

7. The authors measure similarity of predictions using multidimensional scaling. What other embedding methods could be used to analyze similarity of predictions from prompt variations?

8. The jailbreaks caused significant performance dips. Do you think this demonstrates brittleness of the model despite the large-scale training, or an intentional compromise to enforce content policy compliance?

9. How difficult would it be to modify or fine-tune ChatGPT's underlying architecture to make it more robust to minor prompt variations? What tradeoffs need to be considered?  

10. The study focuses specifically on classification tasks. Would you expect similar effects of prompt variations for open-ended, generative tasks? Why or why not?
