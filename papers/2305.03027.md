# [NeRSemble: Multi-view Radiance Field Reconstruction of Human Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03027)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields of dynamic human heads that enable photo-realistic novel view synthesis from sparse multi-view video inputs?The authors propose a new method called NeRSemble to address this question. The key ideas are:1) Representing the dynamic scene using a combination of a deformation field and an ensemble of multi-resolution hash grid features. 2) The deformation field captures coarse motions, while the hash ensemble represents finer details and complex movements.3) A warm-up training phase that first optimizes just the deformation field, allowing it to learn meaningful correspondences before introducing the hash ensemble.4) Evaluation on a new multi-view dataset of human heads captured by the authors, where NeRSemble outperforms other state-of-the-art dynamic NeRF methods.In summary, the paper introduces a novel representation and training procedure for reconstructing high-fidelity radiance fields of human heads from sparse multi-view video. The research hypothesis is that this approach will enable higher quality novel view synthesis compared to prior dynamic scene reconstruction techniques. The experiments seem to validate this hypothesis.
