# [Large Language Model for Participatory Urban Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17161)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional participatory urban planning methods are time-consuming, rely heavily on experienced planners, and fail to effectively incorporate diverse perspectives and needs of residents. Recent AI methods for urban planning also lack resident participation.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate participants in participatory urban planning. Specifically:

1) LLM agents are created to play the roles of an urban planner and thousands of residents with diverse backgrounds and needs.

2) The planner agent makes an initial land-use plan for a region. 

3) Neighboring resident agents discuss their opinions on the plan through multi-round "fishbowl" discussions to balance their diverse needs. 

4) The planner agent revises the plan based on the residents' feedback and aggregated discussion summaries.

5) This collaborative process generates an improved land-use plan catering to residents' needs.

Main Contributions:

- First work to apply LLMs to simulate participatory urban planning process with resident agents.

- Proposes a collaborative framework enabling planner and resident agents to effectively generate land-use plans considering diverse resident needs.

- Adopts "fishbowl" discussion method to enable efficient large-scale resident discussions.  

- Experiments on two real urban regions show the method outperforms baselines in resident satisfaction and inclusion metrics. Also achieves competitive performance in services accessibility and ecology metrics.

In summary, this work demonstrates the promise of using LLMs to simulate participatory planning processes to improve efficiency while still incorporating diverse stakeholder needs and perspectives. The multi-agent collaboration design is generalizable to other domains requiring engagement of a large number of participants.
