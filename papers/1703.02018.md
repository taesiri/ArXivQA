# [Combining Self-Supervised Learning and Imitation for Vision-Based Rope   Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02018)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can a robot learn to manipulate deformable objects like ropes by combining self-supervised learning of low-level dynamics with high-level demonstrations?The key points are:- The authors aim to develop a method for robots to manipulate deformable objects like ropes into desired configurations, which is very challenging. - Their approach combines self-supervised learning of an inverse dynamics model with imitation of human demonstrations. - The self-supervised inverse dynamics model allows the robot to learn how to make low-level deformations of the rope from its own autonomous experience. - The human demonstrations provide high-level guidance on the sequence of manipulations needed to achieve a goal configuration.- By combining the learned low-level model with high-level human guidance, the robot can manipulate the rope into various shapes just by watching image sequences of a human demonstrator.So in summary, the central research question is how self-supervised learning of dynamics and imitation of demonstrations can be combined for manipulating deformable objects like ropes, which poses challenges very different from rigid objects.
