# [Training Multi-layer Neural Networks on Ising Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03408)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Ising learning algorithm to train multi-layer feedforward neural networks on Ising machines. Two key techniques are used: constraint representation to formulate network topology and binary encoding to map variables onto Ising spins. Specifically, the algorithm first converts the network training problem into a quadratic constrained binary optimization (QCBO) problem by representing neural operations (e.g. linear transformations and activations) as equality constraints. It then transforms the QCBO into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem solvable on Ising machines, using penalty methods to eliminate constraints and Rosenberg order reduction to obtain a quadratic loss function. Theoretical analysis shows the space complexity scales quadratically with network width and linearly with depth and dataset size. Experiments on a simulated Ising machine demonstrate the algorithm's ability to train a small network to 98.3% accuracy on a simplified MNIST task. As Ising machines continue advancing, this algorithm shows promise for large-scale feedforward network training in a novel, non-gradient paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an Ising learning algorithm to train multi-layer feedforward neural networks on Ising machines for the first time by formulating network topology as constraints and reducing loss function order.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first algorithm that can train multi-layer feedforward neural networks on Ising machines. Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the training of quantized neural networks (QNNs) as a quadratic constrained binary optimization (QCBO) problem. This is done by representing the neural network topology and activation functions as equality constraints and encoding all variables into binaries. 

2) The paper then converts the QCBO problem into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that can be efficiently solved on Ising machines. This conversion eliminates the equality constraints and reduces the loss function into a quadratic one using penalty methods and Rosenberg order reduction.

3) Theoretical analysis shows the space complexity of the proposed algorithm is O(H^2L + HLNlogH), where H is the neural network width, L is the depth, and N is the dataset size. This quantifies the number of spins required on the Ising machine.

4) Experiments on a simulated Ising machine validate the correctness and feasibility of the algorithm by training a small QNN on a simplified MNIST dataset. After 700ms of annealing, 98.3% test accuracy is achieved with 72% probability of finding the optimal solution.

In summary, the key contribution is enabling the training of multi-layer feedforward neural networks on Ising machines for the first time, unlocking a new paradigm for training deep neural networks via quantum computing.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Ising machine - A dedicated quantum device that can efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems formatted as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems.

- Feedforward neural network - A network where information flows uni-directionally from input to output without any cycles, including multi-layer networks. The paper focuses on training quantized feedforward networks.  

- Quantized neural network (QNN) - A neural network where parameters and activations are quantized to a limited set of values. This allows representing them with fewer bits.

- Quadratic constrained binary optimization (QCBO) - An optimization problem with a quadratic objective function, equality constraints, and binary variables. Converting the QNN training to this format is an intermediate step.

- Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) - An optimization problem without constraints that has a quadratic objective function and binary variables. This format matches the Ising machine architecture. 

- Binary encoding - Encoding real-valued parameters as binary numbers by expanding them in a binary basis. This maps neural network parameters to Ising spins.

- Rosenberg polynomial - A method to reduce higher-order objective functions to quadratic by iteratively substituting terms and adding penalty functions. Used to convert the QCBO to a QUBO.

- Space complexity - The number of binary variables (Ising spins) needed to represent the formulated problem. Key metric for assessing feasibility on real hardware.
