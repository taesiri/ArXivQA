# [SpokesBiz -- an Open Corpus of Conversational Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Despite advances in ASR, spoken language corpora remain important for developing and evaluating language processing tools. 
- ASR performance can vary significantly across different types of spoken language.
- There is a need for more freely available Polish speech corpora.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper announces the release of SpokesBiz, a new 652-hour open corpus of conversational Polish.
- It is part of the Spokes family of Polish speech datasets developed over the past 20 years. 
- SpokesBiz comprises 7 subsets of recordings covering different domains like interviews, presentations, podcasts etc.

Key Details:
- The corpus has utterance-level speaker metadata like gender, age and education level. 
- It has been automatically transcribed and manually corrected. 
- The transcripts are annotated with punctuation, casing and aligned at word/utterance level.

Main Contributions:
- SpokesBiz significantly increases the accessibility of Polish speech data.
- It enables linguistic analyses leveraging speaker metadata. 
- It serves as evaluation and fine-tuning benchmark for ASR systems.
- The paper demonstrates sample use cases like ASR evaluation across subcorpora and corpus analysis of gender differences in pitch.

In summary, the paper introduces SpokesBiz, a new large multi-domain corpus of spoken Polish that is freely available to the research community and enables advanced speech and language research as well as ASR system development for Polish.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper announces the release of SpokesBiz, a new freely available corpus of over 650 hours of transcribed Polish speech recordings with speaker metadata that can be used for linguistic research and for developing and evaluating automatic speech recognition systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is the announcement and release of SpokesBiz, a new freely available corpus of over 650 hours of conversational Polish recordings. Specifically, the key points about SpokesBiz that constitute the main contribution are:

- It is a large corpus of natural conversational Polish across various domains like interviews, presentations, podcasts etc. 

- It contains over 650 hours of transcribed and diarized recordings from nearly 600 speakers.

- The transcripts are manually corrected and annotated with punctuation, casing, and speaker metadata like gender, age and education level. 

- It is freely available for non-commercial use for research purposes. 

- It has diverse use cases like linguistic analyses, evaluation and improvement of automatic speech recognition systems for Polish, as demonstrated through some examples in the paper.

So in summary, the paper's key contribution is the development and open release of this substantial new language resource for Polish - the SpokesBiz conversational speech corpus.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on scanning the content of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- SpokesBiz - The name of the new open corpus of conversational Polish being announced and described.

- speech corpora - The paper discusses the development and applications of speech corpora like SpokesBiz.

- language modeling - One intended use case is utilizing SpokesBiz for language modeling. 

- CLARIN-PL - The corpus was developed within the CLARIN-BIZ project under CLARIN-PL.

- ASR evaluation - Another key application is using SpokesBiz to evaluate and improve automatic speech recognition systems.

- sociolectal analyses - The speaker metadata enables running sociolinguistic analyses on lexical/phonetic variation. 

So in summary, the key terms reflect the name and origin of the corpus, its intended applications in ASR and language modeling, and the ability to run sociolinguistic analyses thanks to its speaker annotations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that SpokesBiz was developed under the CLARIN-BIZ project. What were the main goals and motivations behind creating this new Polish speech corpus under this project? 

2. The corpus contains over 650 hours of transcribed conversational speech. What methods and tools were used for the automatic transcription, diarization, and alignment of the recordings? How accurate were these methods?

3. Several subsets of the corpus originate from different sources like interviews, podcasts, presentations etc. What was the rationale behind including this diversity of speech data and what new research possibilities does it open up?

4. The paper reports ASR evaluation results on samples from the corpus. What conclusions can be drawn about the performance of modern ASR systems on conversational speech based on these results? What factors seem to impact accuracy the most?

5. One of the use cases mentioned is linguistic research enabled by speaker metadata. What kinds of sociolectal analyses could be performed leveraging information about speaker age, gender and education level? What hypotheses could be tested?

6. Beyond linguistic research, what other areas could benefit from such a large corpus of richly annotated conversational Polish speech? For example, could it be used for training dialogue systems?

7. The corpus is currently offered free of charge for non-commercial use. Do you expect that charging for access could limit its impact and adoption by researchers? What could be done to balance sustainability and openness? 

8. What procedures and safeguards are in place to protect speaker privacy given that the recordings contain spontaneous conversations on potentially sensitive topics?

9. Why focus efforts on developing resources for Polish versus other higher-resourced languages? What is the expected impact on technology support for Polish? What other resources are still missing?

10. The paper demonstrates a simple use case of analyzing pitch differences between genders. What other audio analyses could be performed leveraging the aligned transcripts, e.g. related to regional accents, speech disorders or paralinguistic phenomena?
