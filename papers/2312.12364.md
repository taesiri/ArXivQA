# [SpokesBiz -- an Open Corpus of Conversational Polish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Despite advances in ASR, spoken language corpora remain important for developing and evaluating language processing tools. 
- ASR performance can vary significantly across different types of spoken language.
- There is a need for more freely available Polish speech corpora.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper announces the release of SpokesBiz, a new 652-hour open corpus of conversational Polish.
- It is part of the Spokes family of Polish speech datasets developed over the past 20 years. 
- SpokesBiz comprises 7 subsets of recordings covering different domains like interviews, presentations, podcasts etc.

Key Details:
- The corpus has utterance-level speaker metadata like gender, age and education level. 
- It has been automatically transcribed and manually corrected. 
- The transcripts are annotated with punctuation, casing and aligned at word/utterance level.

Main Contributions:
- SpokesBiz significantly increases the accessibility of Polish speech data.
- It enables linguistic analyses leveraging speaker metadata. 
- It serves as evaluation and fine-tuning benchmark for ASR systems.
- The paper demonstrates sample use cases like ASR evaluation across subcorpora and corpus analysis of gender differences in pitch.

In summary, the paper introduces SpokesBiz, a new large multi-domain corpus of spoken Polish that is freely available to the research community and enables advanced speech and language research as well as ASR system development for Polish.
