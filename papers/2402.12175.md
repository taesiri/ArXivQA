# [Learning Discretized Bayesian Networks with GOMEA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12175)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian networks are useful for modeling relationships between variables under uncertainty and making predictions. They tend to be compact and relations can be directly inspected, making them interesting for explainable AI (XAI).
- In practice, data is often real-valued. Discretization is often needed unless assumptions of normality can be made. 
- Optimal discretization depends on variable relationships, complicating simultaneous learning of structure and discretization from data.

Proposed Solution:
- Extend Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) for structure learning to jointly learn variable discretizations (DBN-GOMEA).
- Use density function as fitness to optimize uniform discretizations. Add discretization counts to solution encoding.
- Compare to state-of-the-art algorithm LDBN on randomly generated networks with different sample sizes and number of variables.
- Also optimize discretizations after structure learning using real-valued GOMEA.
- Formulate multi-objective version to optimize accuracy, complexity and difference to expert network.

Main Contributions:
- First GOMEA-based algorithm to jointly learn Bayesian network structure and discretizations.
- Competitive performance to state-of-the-art on retrieving random ground truth networks.
- Optimization of discretizations after structure learning further improves networks.  
- Multi-objective formulation enables insightful trade-offs incorporating expert knowledge.
- Opens up potential for expert interaction and explainability.

In summary, this paper presents a novel GOMEA-based approach for learning discrete Bayesian networks from mixed data that jointly optimizes structure and discretizations. Key contributions include competitive performance and unique multi-objective capabilities for expert knowledge integration and explainability.
