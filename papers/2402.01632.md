# [Beyond Lengthscales: No-regret Bayesian Optimisation With Unknown   Hyperparameters Of Any Type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Bayesian optimization (BO) is used for sample-efficient black-box optimization, relying on Gaussian process (GP) models. GP models have hyperparameters that need to be set.
- Most theoretical work assumes GP hyperparameters are known. But in practice, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is used to estimate them based on the observed data.
- MLE is not theoretically guaranteed to recover the true hyperparameters, especially since BO is not collecting data uniformly. So there are no guarantees of BO performance with MLE-tuned hyperparameters.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new BO algorithm called HE-GP-UCB that achieves no-regret property even when the GP hyperparameters are unknown. This is the first algorithm to provably work under arbitrary unknown hyperparameters.
- The algorithm is optimistic regarding hyperparameters - selecting points by maximizing the UCB under the best hyperparameter. After observing function values, hyperparameters that poorly explain the data are eliminated.  
- The proof shows that either all models explain the data well enough or at least one model will be eliminated, ensuring convergence.

Main Contributions:
- First algorithm achieving no-regret under any unknown hyperparameters, for both Bayesian and frequentist settings of BO.
- New proof technique that could be extended to other BO variants. Demonstrated by adapting algorithm & proof for adversarially robust BO.  
- Empirical evaluation shows the algorithm can outperform MLE hyperparameter tuning on some problems.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel BO algorithm and analysis that provides theoretical guarantees even when GP hyperparameters are unknown, addressing a major limitation of existing theoretical work. The empirical results also demonstrate benefits over standard MLE tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new Bayesian optimization algorithm called HE-GP-UCB that achieves no-regret guarantees even when the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process model are unknown and can take arbitrary forms, supporting both Bayesian and frequentist settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes HE-GP-UCB, the first no-regret algorithm for Bayesian optimization (BO) which can handle unknown hyperparameters of arbitrary form. Specifically:

- It works with any type of hyperparameters, not just lengthscales or RKHS norms like previous methods. This includes things like periodicities, additive kernel decompositions, mean functions, etc.

- It achieves no-regret guarantees in both the Bayesian setting (where the objective is sampled from a GP) and frequentist setting. Prior methods only worked in the frequentist case. 

- It makes data-driven updates to eliminate implausible hyperparameter values over time, unlike previous approaches which shrink hyperparameters in a pre-defined way regardless of observations.

2) The proof technique for showing no-regret is novel and extends easily to other BO variants. The paper shows this by adapting HE-GP-UCB to adversarially robust BO.

3) Empirical evaluations show HE-GP-UCB can outperform maximum likelihood estimation for hyperparameters on some problems, demonstrating the benefit of its data-driven elimination strategy.

In summary, it significantly expands the range of problems and settings where we can now theoretically guarantee no-regret performance in BO under unknown hyperparameters, through a very versatile algorithm and analysis.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Bayesian Optimization (BO)
- Gaussian Processes (GPs) 
- Unknown hyperparameters
- No-regret algorithms

- Frequentist and Bayesian settings
- Confidence intervals

- Adversarially robust optimization

The paper proposes a new Bayesian optimization algorithm called HE-GP-UCB that can handle unknown hyperparameters of arbitrary forms and still achieve no-regret guarantees. It works in both frequentist and Bayesian settings. The algorithm eliminates implausible hyperparameter values in a data-driven way based on predictive errors. The proof techniques are novel and based on bounding cumulative regret by splitting iterations into "critical" and "non-critical" sets. Key terms like MIG, RKHS, confidence intervals etc. play an important role in the theoretical analysis. The algorithm is also extended to adversarially robust optimization using similar ideas.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims this is the first no-regret algorithm that can handle unknown hyperparameters of arbitrary form. What specifically about the proof technique allows it to handle arbitrary hyperparameters compared to prior work?

2. How does the algorithm balance exploration and exploitation? Does it exploit models that seem more accurate while still exploring other models that may actually be better?

3. One key aspect is optimistically selecting points based on the best UCB among models. How sensitive is performance to instead using an ensemble UCB prediction? What are the tradeoffs? 

4. For rejecting implausible hyperparameter values, the paper uses predictive errors on observed data points. What would be the effect of instead measuring errors in predicted variances or other statistics?

5. How does runtime scale with the number of hyperparameter values? Could efficient hyperparameter pruning methods further improve performance?

6. The proof relies on accurate confidence intervals from the GP. How would violations of GP assumptions in practice affect the regret guarantees and performance?

7. How does the performance compare to simply running an ensemble of GPs, one per hyperparameter value, and aggregating their predictions? What are the pros and cons?

8. What types of problems lead to worse performance compared to standard BO or MLE hyperparameter tuning? When does this method shine?

9. The method has a frequentist and Bayesian version. What are the practical differences between them and when is each preferred? 

10. How could the method be extended to handle discrete/categorical hyperparameters or complex hierarchical hyperparameter spaces?
