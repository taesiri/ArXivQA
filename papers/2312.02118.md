# [When it Rains, it Pours: Modeling Media Storms and the News Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02118)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new computational approach to quantifying media storms, defined as explosive and long-lasting news stories, across nearly two years and 4 million online news articles. The authors create a state-of-the-art news article similarity model to identify clusters of articles covering the same story. Using this, they identify 98 media storms which comprise over 20,000 articles covered widely across 417 news outlets. Analyzing these storms validates prior theoretical claims about their temporal dynamics, showing an explosive rise in coverage followed by a gradual decline over an average of 15 days. The paper also finds media storms cover a more skewed set of topics compared to typical news, with politics, disasters, court cases, and police issues being disproportionately represented. Finally, the analysis provides empirical evidence for hypothesized mechanisms governing storm development, including lowered gatekeeping thresholds within outlets and intermedia agenda setting in which outlets mimic the prominent coverage from influential news organizations. Overall, this computational analysis advances our understanding of how major news stories propagate.
