# [When it Rains, it Pours: Modeling Media Storms and the News Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02118)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Media storms are explosive events that gain high volume, widespread coverage for a sustained period of time across news outlets. They capture public attention and influence the public agenda. While prior work has theorized about media storms, there has been limited quantitative analysis of the conditions under which they emerge and their effects on the news ecosystem.

Solution:
This paper develops a state-of-the-art news article similarity model to identify story clusters from over 4 million articles spanning nearly 2 years. It uses the model to create a comprehensive corpus of 98 media storms. The paper then leverages this corpus to characterize media storms and validate claims about their temporal dynamics, topical distribution, and mechanisms of development.

Key Contributions:

- Creates a highly accurate news article similarity model using a bi-encoder strategy and data augmentation. Achieves 0.86 correlation on SemEval benchmark.

- Identifies 98 media storms from April 2020 - December 2021, releasing storm dataset.

- Confirms media storms last around 15 days on average. Shows coverage rises quickly then fades gradually. 

- Demonstrates media storms focus disproportionately on political and disaster events compared to other news.

- Provides empirical evidence that gatekeeping thresholds fall during storms, with related coverage rising.

- Reveals lead-lag relationships between media outlets during storms, supporting intermedia agenda setting theories.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and empirical contributions toward understanding media storms. It models news similarity to enable tracing stories over time, reveals new findings about storm dynamics and topics, and offers support for theories about their development. The resources produced move forward computational analyses in this space.
