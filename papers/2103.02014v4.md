# [Online Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02014v4)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we efficiently generate adversarial examples in an online setting where data arrives sequentially and decisions to attack must be made immediately?

The key elements of this online threat model are:

- Data arrives as a stream, so examples are only observed once. Attacking decisions must be made immediately and can't be reversed later. 

- The attacker has a limited budget (k attacks) and must decide which examples in the stream are most valuable to attack.

- The attacker has only partial knowledge of the target model. They use a surrogate model to estimate attack success likelihood.

To address this, the paper draws connections between online attacks and the k-secretary problem in theoretical computer science. It proposes a new algorithm called Virtual+ for intelligently selecting which examples to attack online. 

The main hypothesis seems to be that formalizing online attacks in this way and applying online selection algorithms like Virtual+ will enable more efficient attacks compared to naive approaches in this restricted online setting. Experiments across datasets support this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is how to perform adversarial attacks under the novel constraints imposed by an online threat model, which better captures real-world scenarios involving streaming data.
