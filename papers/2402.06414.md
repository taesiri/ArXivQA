# [Trust the Process: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning to Enhance Trust in   Generative AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models like GPT have enabled new capabilities but also raised concerns about fairness, transparency and reliability, especially in sensitive domains like medicine and law. 
- There is a lack of guarantees that users of remote generative AI services (e.g. ChatGPT) always interact with the precise model and performance level they pay for. This is an issue of "performance fairness".

Proposed Solution:
- Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) to enable users to verify the accuracy and provenance of AI model outputs without compromising model privacy. 
- ZKML allows model owners to publish a cryptographic commitment to their model while enabling users to verify that the outputs they receive were genuinely produced by the exact model via succinct proofs.
- This cryptographically ensures performance fairness without revealing sensitive intellectual property in the model weights.

Contributions:
- Introduction of "snarkGPT", a practical ZKML pipeline implementation for transformer models like GPT that generates a proof attesting to the correct execution for a given input.
- Proposal of protocol for using snarkGPT to enable guarantees about performance fairness for generative AI services.
- Empirical analysis demonstrating the feasibility of generating proofs for GPT-scale models within reasonable time and memory constraints.
- Demonstration that approach generalizes beyond just GPT architectures.
- Highlights ZKML as a vital tool for enabling transparent, reliable and equitable AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using zero-knowledge proofs to enable users of generative AI models like GPT to verify that the model is executing correctly on their inputs, thereby ensuring performance fairness without compromising model privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a protocol that uses zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) to ensure performance fairness and reliable quality in generative AI models served through cloud APIs. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a protocol where users can obtain a cryptographic proof from the AI model provider showing that their specific input was processed by the exact model they requested. This ensures all users get uniform quality.

- The viability of this approach is demonstrated through "snarkGPT", a prototype implementation for GPT-style models. Empirical evaluations on snarkGPT show the feasibility of generating proofs for models up to hundreds of millions of parameters.

- The paper frames this as an approach to promote performance fairness by guaranteeing uniform model execution across users, complementing existing techniques for mitigating biases. It also argues zero-knowledge proofs can enhance trust in sensitive applications like medicine and law.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a practical zero-knowledge based protocol to certify the correct and fair execution of generative AI models to remote users.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces "snarkGPT", a verifiable ZKML pipeline for GPT2-like models. What specific adaptations were made to the nanoGPT architecture to make it compatible with generating zkSNARK proofs? Why were these changes necessary?

2. The paper argues that using zkSNARKs can help address performance fairness issues in generative AI models. Concretely, how does the proposed ZKML protocol empower users to validate that remote generative AI services provide consistent quality across users? 

3. The authors present empirical results studying the scalability of snarkGPT by increasing model parameters like number of layers and embedding size. What key insights do these experiments provide regarding the feasibility of their approach? What factors limit scalability?

4. How exactly does the size (number of rows) allocated to represent the circuit matrix impact both proving time and memory costs? Why does the relationship appear to be non-linear? 

5. The paper argues ZKML can complement existing techniques for AI fairness. How specifically could snarkGPT or similar methods help enhance transparency and eliminate discrimination in applications like credit scoring models?

7. What architectural and methodological factors contribute to the constraints-to-parameters ratio in ZKML proofs? Why is minimizing this ratio an important area of research to improve efficiency?

8. The paper mentions using a "credible commitment device" to commit to model weights. What is the purpose of this component and how does it fit into the overall ZKML protocol?

9. How exactly could the proposed ZKML approach help address the problem introduced initially regarding premium vs free versions of ChatGPT? What guarantees does it provide?

10. What limitations or challenges remain in practice regarding deploying ZKML solutions like snarkGPT to production generative AI services? How might these be addressed in future work?
