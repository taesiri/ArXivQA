# [Trust the Process: Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning to Enhance Trust in   Generative AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06414)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generative AI models like GPT have enabled new capabilities but also raised concerns about fairness, transparency and reliability, especially in sensitive domains like medicine and law. 
- There is a lack of guarantees that users of remote generative AI services (e.g. ChatGPT) always interact with the precise model and performance level they pay for. This is an issue of "performance fairness".

Proposed Solution:
- Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) to enable users to verify the accuracy and provenance of AI model outputs without compromising model privacy. 
- ZKML allows model owners to publish a cryptographic commitment to their model while enabling users to verify that the outputs they receive were genuinely produced by the exact model via succinct proofs.
- This cryptographically ensures performance fairness without revealing sensitive intellectual property in the model weights.

Contributions:
- Introduction of "snarkGPT", a practical ZKML pipeline implementation for transformer models like GPT that generates a proof attesting to the correct execution for a given input.
- Proposal of protocol for using snarkGPT to enable guarantees about performance fairness for generative AI services.
- Empirical analysis demonstrating the feasibility of generating proofs for GPT-scale models within reasonable time and memory constraints.
- Demonstration that approach generalizes beyond just GPT architectures.
- Highlights ZKML as a vital tool for enabling transparent, reliable and equitable AI systems.
