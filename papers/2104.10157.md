# [VideoGPT: Video Generation using VQ-VAE and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a simple and scalable architecture for generating high-fidelity and diverse video samples?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Downsampling videos spatially and temporally using a VQ-VAE can produce a low-dimensional discrete latent representation that captures the core semantics. 

2) Modeling these discrete latents autoregressively with a transformer architecture can generate realistic and diverse video samples.

3) This two-stage generative modeling approach of VQ-VAE followed by transformers can produce strong video generation results while being simple and scalable.

The paper seems focused on demonstrating these hypotheses through empirical results on video generation tasks using the proposed VideoGPT architecture. The goal is to show VideoGPT can generate realistic and diverse videos competitively with state-of-the-art approaches, validating the core hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents VideoGPT, a conceptually simple architecture for video generation that combines VQ-VAE and transformer models. The key contributions are:

- Proposes a two-stage approach where a VQ-VAE is first trained to learn a discrete latent representation of the video, and then a transformer model is trained autoregressively on the latents. 

- Shows that this approach can generate high quality and diverse video samples on complex datasets like BAIR, UCF-101 and Tumblr GIFs. The samples are competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models.

- Provides careful ablation studies analyzing the impact of different design choices like axial attention in VQ-VAE, size of the latent space, number of codebooks, and model capacity. 

- Demonstrates the flexibility of the approach through conditional video generation, by using cross-attention and conditional norms in the transformer.

- Presents a simple and minimal implementation for transformer-based video generation that is easy to reproduce.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating VideoGPT, a straightforward combination of VQ-VAE and Transformers for likelihood-based video generation. The results show this simple approach can achieve strong performance and high quality generations.
