# [VideoGPT: Video Generation using VQ-VAE and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a simple and scalable architecture for generating high-fidelity and diverse video samples?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Downsampling videos spatially and temporally using a VQ-VAE can produce a low-dimensional discrete latent representation that captures the core semantics. 

2) Modeling these discrete latents autoregressively with a transformer architecture can generate realistic and diverse video samples.

3) This two-stage generative modeling approach of VQ-VAE followed by transformers can produce strong video generation results while being simple and scalable.

The paper seems focused on demonstrating these hypotheses through empirical results on video generation tasks using the proposed VideoGPT architecture. The goal is to show VideoGPT can generate realistic and diverse videos competitively with state-of-the-art approaches, validating the core hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents VideoGPT, a conceptually simple architecture for video generation that combines VQ-VAE and transformer models. The key contributions are:

- Proposes a two-stage approach where a VQ-VAE is first trained to learn a discrete latent representation of the video, and then a transformer model is trained autoregressively on the latents. 

- Shows that this approach can generate high quality and diverse video samples on complex datasets like BAIR, UCF-101 and Tumblr GIFs. The samples are competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models.

- Provides careful ablation studies analyzing the impact of different design choices like axial attention in VQ-VAE, size of the latent space, number of codebooks, and model capacity. 

- Demonstrates the flexibility of the approach through conditional video generation, by using cross-attention and conditional norms in the transformer.

- Presents a simple and minimal implementation for transformer-based video generation that is easy to reproduce.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating VideoGPT, a straightforward combination of VQ-VAE and Transformers for likelihood-based video generation. The results show this simple approach can achieve strong performance and high quality generations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes VideoGPT, a video generation model combining VQ-VAE for learning a discrete latent representation and a transformer autoregressive prior, achieving strong results on datasets like BAIR, UCF-101, and TGIF.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this ICML 2021 sample paper compares to other research in the field of video generation:

- The overall approach of using VQ-VAE to learn a discrete latent representation followed by an autoregressive model over the latents is similar to other work like VQ-VAE-2 and DALL-E. However, this paper presents a simpler and more minimal implementation focused specifically on video generation. 

- Compared to other video generation methods like GANs, this approach is likelihood-based which has some advantages like ease of training and evaluation. The samples are competitive with state-of-the-art GANs like DVD-GAN according to the FVD metric.

- The axial attention mechanism used in the VQ-VAE encoder/decoder seems to improve reconstruction quality compared to just using convolutions. This is consistent with findings in other work showing benefits of attention for generative models.

- Ablation studies provide insights on model design choices like the right latent size tradeoff, benefits of a single codebook, and transformer capacity. These help guide architecture decisions compared to prior work.

- The model is able to generate reasonable 64x64 videos on complex datasets like UCF-101 and TGIF. But quality still seems limited compared to state of the art on higher resolutions, suggesting opportunities for improvement.

- The approach is shown to work for conditional video generation tasks like generating robotic pushing videos conditioned on an initial frame. This demonstrates flexibility beyond just unconditional generation.

Overall, this paper provides a solid reference implementation for transformer-based video generation using VQ-VAE. While quality/resolution is still limited compared to leading approaches, the simplicity and strong ablation studies are valuable contributions to guide progress in this area.
