# [VideoGPT: Video Generation using VQ-VAE and Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10157)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a simple and scalable architecture for generating high-fidelity and diverse video samples?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Downsampling videos spatially and temporally using a VQ-VAE can produce a low-dimensional discrete latent representation that captures the core semantics. 

2) Modeling these discrete latents autoregressively with a transformer architecture can generate realistic and diverse video samples.

3) This two-stage generative modeling approach of VQ-VAE followed by transformers can produce strong video generation results while being simple and scalable.

The paper seems focused on demonstrating these hypotheses through empirical results on video generation tasks using the proposed VideoGPT architecture. The goal is to show VideoGPT can generate realistic and diverse videos competitively with state-of-the-art approaches, validating the core hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents VideoGPT, a conceptually simple architecture for video generation that combines VQ-VAE and transformer models. The key contributions are:

- Proposes a two-stage approach where a VQ-VAE is first trained to learn a discrete latent representation of the video, and then a transformer model is trained autoregressively on the latents. 

- Shows that this approach can generate high quality and diverse video samples on complex datasets like BAIR, UCF-101 and Tumblr GIFs. The samples are competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models.

- Provides careful ablation studies analyzing the impact of different design choices like axial attention in VQ-VAE, size of the latent space, number of codebooks, and model capacity. 

- Demonstrates the flexibility of the approach through conditional video generation, by using cross-attention and conditional norms in the transformer.

- Presents a simple and minimal implementation for transformer-based video generation that is easy to reproduce.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating VideoGPT, a straightforward combination of VQ-VAE and Transformers for likelihood-based video generation. The results show this simple approach can achieve strong performance and high quality generations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes VideoGPT, a video generation model combining VQ-VAE for learning a discrete latent representation and a transformer autoregressive prior, achieving strong results on datasets like BAIR, UCF-101, and TGIF.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this ICML 2021 sample paper compares to other research in the field of video generation:

- The overall approach of using VQ-VAE to learn a discrete latent representation followed by an autoregressive model over the latents is similar to other work like VQ-VAE-2 and DALL-E. However, this paper presents a simpler and more minimal implementation focused specifically on video generation. 

- Compared to other video generation methods like GANs, this approach is likelihood-based which has some advantages like ease of training and evaluation. The samples are competitive with state-of-the-art GANs like DVD-GAN according to the FVD metric.

- The axial attention mechanism used in the VQ-VAE encoder/decoder seems to improve reconstruction quality compared to just using convolutions. This is consistent with findings in other work showing benefits of attention for generative models.

- Ablation studies provide insights on model design choices like the right latent size tradeoff, benefits of a single codebook, and transformer capacity. These help guide architecture decisions compared to prior work.

- The model is able to generate reasonable 64x64 videos on complex datasets like UCF-101 and TGIF. But quality still seems limited compared to state of the art on higher resolutions, suggesting opportunities for improvement.

- The approach is shown to work for conditional video generation tasks like generating robotic pushing videos conditioned on an initial frame. This demonstrates flexibility beyond just unconditional generation.

Overall, this paper provides a solid reference implementation for transformer-based video generation using VQ-VAE. While quality/resolution is still limited compared to leading approaches, the simplicity and strong ablation studies are valuable contributions to guide progress in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring larger and more complex video datasets beyond UCF-101 and BAIR. The authors mention that UCF-101 may be too small and overfit easily by VideoGPT. Larger and more diverse video datasets could allow training more powerful generative video models.

- Extending the conditional generation capabilities of VideoGPT, such as generation from natural language descriptions or other modalities. The authors show some initial results on conditional generation but suggest there is room for improvement.

- Investigating alternatives to axial attention in the VQ-VAE, such as full 3D attention. The axial attention helps but may still limit modeling long-range dependencies. 

- Experimenting with hierarchical multi-scale VQ-VAE architectures, instead of just a single scale of latent codes. The authors mention this could allow scaling to even higher resolutions and fidelity.

- Comparing likelihood-based models like VideoGPT to other popular generative model families like GANs and diffusion models in a standardized benchmark. This could reveal strengths/weaknesses of different approaches.

- Exploring semi-supervised and self-supervised pre-training schemes for video generation models, to make better use of large unlabeled video datasets.

- Investigating auxiliary losses and techniques to improve optimization and stability when scaling up model size and datasets.

In summary, the main themes seem to be scaling up in terms of model capacity, dataset complexity, conditional generation capabilities, and benchmarking different modeling approaches for video generation. The overall goal remains generating diverse, high-fidelity, controllable video samples.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This ICML 2021 paper proposes VideoGPT, a conceptually simple architecture for video generation that combines VQ-VAE and transformers. The method first uses a 3D convolutional VQ-VAE to learn discrete latent representations of the raw video frames. Axial self-attention blocks are incorporated in the VQ-VAE encoder and decoder. The discrete latents are then modeled autoregressively using a GPT-style transformer with spatio-temporal position encodings. Despite the simplicity, VideoGPT can generate high quality videos competitive with state-of-the-art GANs, as demonstrated on the BAIR robot pushing dataset, UCF-101, and Tumblr GIF datasets. Ablation studies analyze the impact of various architecture choices like axial attention blocks, latent space size, number of codebooks, and transformer capacity. The paper presents a minimalistic and reproducible implementation of transformer-based video generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents VideoGPT, a conceptually simple architecture for scaling likelihood based generative modeling to natural videos. The architecture has two main components: a VQ-VAE and a transformer. The VQ-VAE uses 3D convolutions and axial self-attention to learn a discrete latent representation that captures the contents of the raw video frames. This discretized latent space removes spatial and temporal redundancies. An autoregressive transformer model is then used to generate sequences in this latent space, employing spatio-temporal position encodings. Despite the simplicity, VideoGPT is able to generate high quality and diverse video samples on complex datasets like BAIR, UCF-101, and TGIF. It is competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models on BAIR while being straightforward to train.

The authors present ablation studies analyzing the effects of different design choices like axial attention blocks, latent space size, number of codebooks, and model capacity. VideoGPT can also be adapted for conditional generation, with examples shown on BAIR and ViZDoom environments. The hope is that VideoGPT can serve as a simple and reproducible reference implementation for transformer based video generation. The core ideas are leveraging VQ-VAE to create a compressed latent representation combined with a powerful autoregressive transformer prior to model sequences in this space.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents VideoGPT, a conceptually simple architecture for scaling likelihood based generative modeling to natural videos. The method has two main stages:

1) Learning downsampled discrete latent representations of raw videos using a VQ-VAE. The VQ-VAE uses 3D convolutions and axial self-attention to encode the videos into discrete latents. 

2) Modeling the discrete latents autoregressively using a simple GPT-like architecture with spatio-temporal position encodings. This serves as the prior network.

For inference, latents are first sampled from the prior network and then decoded to video samples using the VQ-VAE decoder. Despite the simplicity, VideoGPT is able to generate high-fidelity and diverse video samples competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models on datasets like BAIR, UCF-101 and TGIF.
