# [Can Factual Statements be Deceptive? The DeFaBel Corpus of Belief-based   Deception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10185)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presentation of a new deception corpus (DeFaBel) containing argumentative texts in German, labeled for deceptiveness. This is the first publicly available German corpus for studying deception from a language perspective. 

2. The corpus uses a novel annotation scheme where deceptive intent is aligned to argumentation that contradicts one's own beliefs. This is the first dataset that disentangles factuality and belief in the context of deception.

3. Analysis of the corpus showing that people are more confident in arguments aligned with their beliefs, but less confident when arguing factual statements. 

4. Laying the foundation for new deception detection models that can disentangle deceptiveness and factuality, with potential applications in both deception research and improvement of fact-checking models.

In summary, the key contribution is the creation of a new deception dataset that allows, for the first time, to study the interplay between factuality, belief, and deceptive intent based on argumentative texts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Deception

- Corpus
- Argumentation
- Crowd-sourcing
- Persuasion
- Factuality
- Misinformation
- Disinformation
- TruthfulQA
- DeFaBel

The paper introduces the DeFaBel corpus for studying the interplay between factual accuracy, personal beliefs, and intent to deceive in argumentative texts. It uses a novel annotation scheme to align deceptive intent with arguments that contradict one's beliefs. The corpus contains German argumentative texts collected via crowd-sourcing, labeled for deceptiveness based on the authors' beliefs about the factual accuracy of statements. Key goals are disentangling deceptiveness and factuality in language, and improving deception and fact-checking models. So the key terms reflect concepts around deception, persuasion, beliefs, and factuality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How did the authors select the initial set of 50 questions from the TruthfulQA dataset to assess people's beliefs on? What criteria did they use and why?

2. In the belief assessment survey, why did the authors choose a 5-point Likert scale to capture people's belief levels? Would a different scale with fewer or more points have been more effective? Why or why not?

3. The authors used a diversity score to filter the questions for the argument generation task. Can you explain the details of how this diversity score was calculated? What was the rationale behind using those specific parameters?  

4. In formulating the argument generation task instructions, what considerations went into converting the yes/no belief assessment questions into argument generation prompts?

5. Why did the authors have participants disclose their actual beliefs after writing each argument instead of before? What potential issue were they trying to avoid?  

6. For the deception labels, arguments were labeled as deceptive if belief was >=3. What would be the implications of using a higher or lower threshold for the deception labeling?

7. Why did the authors collect information on both topic familiarity and confidence in argument persuasiveness? How might these two measures relate or differ?  

8. The analysis revealed higher confidence for non-deceptive arguments. Could this be attributed more to belief alignment or higher topic familiarity? How could the authors further analyze this?   

9. What statistical test did the authors use to validate the assumption that selected questions exhibited belief distribution diversity? Why was that test suitable?

10. Could the proposed method be adapted to create comparable deception corpora in other languages? What considerations would need to be made?


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents the DeFaBel corpus of 1031 German argumentative texts labeled for deceptiveness based on contradiction with authors' beliefs, to study the interplay between deception, factuality, and personal beliefs.
