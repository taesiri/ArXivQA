# [Not all Minorities are Equal: Empty-Class-Aware Distillation for   Heterogeneous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02329)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Heterogeneous data distributions across clients is a major challenge in federated learning, leading to poor performance especially for minority and empty classes. 
- Prior methods try to balance minority/majority classes but neglect empty classes which are completely absent in some clients' data. This causes severe overfitting and performance decline.

Proposed Solution - FedED:
- Integrates two components - empty-class distillation and logit suppression
- Empty-Class Distillation: Leverages knowledge distillation to retain information about empty classes from global model when training local clients. Prevents disregarding empty classes.  
- Logit Suppression: Regularizes the output logits for non-label classes to penalize misclassifying minority classes into majority classes. Improves generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies issue of disregarding empty classes in prior federated learning methods
- Proposes FedED with above two components to preserve empty class information and prevent overfitting
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets and varying heterogeneity levels
- Ablation studies validate efficacy of both distillation & suppression components in FedED
- Shows robustness - consistency across backbones, client participation rates, comm rounds etc.

In summary, it proposes an innovative federated learning algorithm FedED to address the problem of empty classes being neglected, through explicit empty class distillation and logit suppression for minority classes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent and significant gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning method called FedED that integrates empty-class distillation and logit suppression to address performance decline in minority and empty classes under heterogeneous label distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new heterogeneous federated learning method called FedED that integrates both empty-class distillation and logit suppression to address the issue of poor performance on minority classes, especially empty classes, under heterogeneous label distributions. Specifically:

1) Empty-class distillation leverages knowledge distillation during local training on each client to retain essential information related to empty classes from the global model. This helps mitigate the disregard of empty classes in previous methods. 

2) Logit suppression directly penalizes network logits for non-label classes, effectively addressing misclassifications in minority classes that may be biased toward majority classes. This further improves generalization of local models.

3) Extensive experiments validate that FedED outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets with varying degrees of label distribution shift. It consistently achieves higher accuracy, especially for minority and empty classes, demonstrating the efficacy of both the empty-class distillation and logit suppression components.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the FedED method to effectively handle label distribution shift in federated learning by explicitly considering and preserving information about empty classes and suppressing incorrect minority class predictions.

The paper introduces a new federated learning method called FedED to address performance declines in minority and empty classes under heterogeneous label distributions across clients. The key components of FedED are empty-class distillation to retain information about empty classes and logit suppression to regularize predictions for non-label classes. The paper demonstrates improved class-wise accuracy, mitigation of local overfitting, and higher communication efficiency compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.
