# [A Whac-A-Mole Dilemma: Shortcuts Come in Multiples Where Mitigating One   Amplifies Others](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is whether existing methods can overcome multiple shortcuts in images or struggle in a "Whac-A-Mole" game, where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Real-world images contain multiple visual cues (shortcuts) that models can exploit, beyond the oversimplified assumption of a single shortcut made in prior work.

2) When multiple shortcuts are present, both standard models and existing techniques designed to combat shortcuts will struggle, caught in a "Whac-A-Mole" dilemma where mitigating one shortcut amplifies others.

To test these hypotheses, the paper introduces two new benchmarks with precisely controlled or naturally occurring multiple shortcuts - UrbanCars and ImageNet-W. It then conducts extensive experiments evaluating a wide range of models and mitigation methods. The key findings confirm the "Whac-A-Mole" effect, supporting the paper's central hypothesis that combating multiple shortcuts is an overlooked challenge. The paper aims to motivate more research into this critical direction for improving model robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing two new datasets to study multi-shortcut learning: UrbanCars and ImageNet-W. 

- UrbanCars contains precisely controlled spurious correlations of multiple shortcuts (background and co-occurring object). This allows controlled experiments on multi-shortcut learning and mitigation methods.

- ImageNet-W overlays watermarks on ImageNet validation images to reveal a pervasive watermark shortcut that nearly all modern vision models rely on. Along with texture and background, ImageNet-W enables evaluating models on multiple naturally occurring shortcuts in ImageNet.

2. Through extensive experiments on the new datasets, the paper reveals that mitigating one shortcut can amplify reliance on others in a "Whac-A-Mole" phenomenon. This is observed across various methods, including those designed for shortcut mitigation, and even large foundation models. 

3. Proposing a new method called Last Layer Ensemble (LLE) that can mitigate multiple known shortcuts simultaneously without Whac-A-Mole behavior by training an ensemble of last layers with different augmentations and a distributional shift classifier.

In summary, the key contribution is revealing the overlooked challenge of multi-shortcut mitigation through new datasets and models, as existing works make the tenuous assumption that only a single shortcut exists. The paper argues the community should move beyond this simplifying assumption to advance robust and reliable vision systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new benchmarks revealing that computer vision models universally struggle to overcome multiple shortcuts in a "Whac-A-Mole" dilemma, where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others, and introduces a new method to mitigate multiple shortcuts jointly without this issue.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several important contributions to the study of shortcut learning and mitigation in computer vision models:

- It proposes two new datasets for evaluating multi-shortcut learning: UrbanCars and ImageNet-W. Previous datasets like Waterbirds have focused on a single spurious shortcut, but real-world images contain multiple shortcuts. These new datasets enable more rigorous testing of models' robustness to multiple shortcuts.

- Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that many existing methods designed to mitigate shortcuts struggle when multiple shortcuts are present. This phenomenon is likened to a "Whac-A-Mole" game, where mitigating one shortcut can amplify reliance on others. This reveals that multi-shortcut mitigation remains an open challenge. 

- The paper proposes a new method, Last Layer Ensemble (LLE), to mitigate multiple known shortcuts without Whac-A-Mole behavior. LLE trains an ensemble of classifiers to handle different data augmentations targeting each shortcut type. A distribution shift classifier then dynamically aggregates predictions based on the predicted shortcut.

- The paper tests shortcut mitigation methods much more extensively than prior works, evaluating not just specialized techniques but also standard regularization methods, self-supervised models, and foundation models. The ubiquity of the Whac-A-Mole problem is concerning.

Overall, this paper significantly advances the study of robustness in vision systems by shifting focus to the overlooked but critical problem of multi-shortcut learning. The new datasets, extensive experiments, Whac-A-Mole characterization, and LLE approach help expose this problem and chart a path forward. This work highlights the need to move beyond simplified assumptions commonly made in prior shortcut research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Drop the unrealistic single-shortcut assumption and be aware of the multiple-shortcut problem when designing methods for shortcut mitigation. Researchers should sanity check various inductive biases like the usage of shortcut labels, assumptions about when shortcuts are learned during training, data augmentation strategies, etc. to see if they could lead to amplifying unlabeled shortcuts.

- Create new benchmark datasets with a broader range of factors of variation (FoVs) as potential shortcuts, either through controlled construction or by developing better techniques to detect multiple shortcuts in wild datasets. This will facilitate more rigorous evaluation of multi-shortcut mitigation.

- Develop new methods that can mitigate multiple known shortcuts simultaneously without amplifying unknown shortcuts. The authors propose Last Layer Ensemble as an initial solution but note limitations when shortcut types are unknown. 

- Apply ideas of multi-shortcut mitigation to shortcut detection as well. Current detection benchmarks only consider single shortcuts and may not expose failures on multiple shortcuts.

- Explore human-in-the-loop solutions that first detect/interpret shortcuts via methods like saliency maps and then apply mitigation methods like the authors' Last Layer Ensemble to fix known shortcuts.

- Conduct further theoretical analysis to explain phenomena like the observed asynchronous learning of different shortcuts during training that leads to the Whac-A-Mole effect when pseudo-labeling methods try to identify all shortcuts.

In summary, the key directions are developing multi-shortcut aware datasets, methods, and benchmarks while also advancing theory around training dynamics with multiple shortcuts. I think these suggestions would significantly advance reliability and out-of-distribution generalization of vision systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two new benchmarks to evaluate the ability of machine learning models to mitigate reliance on multiple spurious correlations (shortcuts) in image data. First, they create a new dataset called UrbanCars which contains two controlled shortcuts - background and co-occurring objects. Second, they discover a pervasive watermark shortcut in ImageNet that causes models to incorrectly predict images as the "carton" class when a watermark is added. Using these datasets, they evaluate many state-of-the-art vision models including standard training, data augmentations, shortcut mitigation methods, self-supervised learning and foundation models. They find that these models often exhibit a "Whac-A-Mole" behavior where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. To address this, they propose a simple yet effective method called Last Layer Ensemble that uses an ensemble of classifiers trained on different augmentations to mitigate multiple known shortcuts jointly. Their work demonstrates that multi-shortcut mitigation is an overlooked challenge and proposes useful benchmarks and a promising solution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes new benchmarks and methods for studying and mitigating the problem of multiple shortcuts in image classification models. The authors introduce two new datasets, UrbanCars and ImageNet-W, that contain precise combinations of multiple spurious correlations that allow controlled study of multi-shortcut learning. Through extensive experiments, they find that many state-of-the-art models, including standard training, data augmentations, and shortcut mitigation methods, encounter a "Whac-A-Mole" problem when multiple shortcuts are present - mitigating one shortcut can amplify reliance on others. 

To address this challenge, the authors propose a new method called Last Layer Ensemble (LLE) that trains an ensemble of classification layers to mitigate reliance on multiple known shortcut types via targeted data augmentation, without needing shortcut labels. Each layer specializes in images augmented to remove one shortcut type. A distribution shift classifier predicts weights for aggregating predictions based on the augmentation used at test time. Experiments show LLE can mitigate reliance on multiple shortcuts without the Whac-A-Mole effect on both controlled and natural image datasets. The new benchmarks and analysis reveal multi-shortcut mitigation as an overlooked challenge for advancing the reliability of vision systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called Last Layer Ensemble (LLE) to mitigate multiple known shortcuts in vision models without requiring shortcut labels. LLE trains an ensemble of classification layers on top of a shared feature extractor, where each classification layer is trained on images augmented with a different data augmentation technique to modify a specific known shortcut cue (e.g. texture, background). A distributional shift classifier is also trained on top of the feature extractor to predict which augmentation was applied to an image, and this guides ensembling the predictions from the classification layers at test time. By training specialized classification layers for each augmentation type and using the distributional shift classifier to combine them, LLE is able to mitigate reliance on multiple known shortcuts simultaneously without exhibiting "Whac-A-Mole" behavior where reducing one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. A key aspect is not requiring ground truth shortcut labels, making the approach scalable.

The key research question is whether existing methods that try to address shortcut learning can overcome multiple shortcuts simultaneously, or if they struggle in a "Whac-A-Mole" game where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others.

Some key points:

- Most prior work makes the unrealistic assumption that only a single shortcut exists in the data. In real images there are often multiple shortcuts like background, texture, objects, etc. 

- The paper proposes two new datasets to study multi-shortcut learning: UrbanCars with controlled background and co-occurring object shortcuts, and ImageNet-W which reveals a new watermark shortcut in ImageNet models.

- Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that many existing methods exhibit "Whac-A-Mole" behavior - reducing one shortcut but amplifying others. This includes data augmentation methods as well as techniques that use shortcut labels.

- The paper proposes a new method called Last Layer Ensemble that can mitigate multiple known shortcuts simultaneously without Whac-A-Mole problems.

In summary, the key contribution is revealing multi-shortcut mitigation as a major overlooked challenge in improving model robustness, and providing new datasets and analysis to understand this problem. The paper aims to motivate more research into jointly mitigating multiple shortcuts.
