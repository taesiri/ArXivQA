# [A Whac-A-Mole Dilemma: Shortcuts Come in Multiples Where Mitigating One   Amplifies Others](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question is whether existing methods can overcome multiple shortcuts in images or struggle in a "Whac-A-Mole" game, where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. The key hypotheses are:1) Real-world images contain multiple visual cues (shortcuts) that models can exploit, beyond the oversimplified assumption of a single shortcut made in prior work.2) When multiple shortcuts are present, both standard models and existing techniques designed to combat shortcuts will struggle, caught in a "Whac-A-Mole" dilemma where mitigating one shortcut amplifies others.To test these hypotheses, the paper introduces two new benchmarks with precisely controlled or naturally occurring multiple shortcuts - UrbanCars and ImageNet-W. It then conducts extensive experiments evaluating a wide range of models and mitigation methods. The key findings confirm the "Whac-A-Mole" effect, supporting the paper's central hypothesis that combating multiple shortcuts is an overlooked challenge. The paper aims to motivate more research into this critical direction for improving model robustness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing two new datasets to study multi-shortcut learning: UrbanCars and ImageNet-W. - UrbanCars contains precisely controlled spurious correlations of multiple shortcuts (background and co-occurring object). This allows controlled experiments on multi-shortcut learning and mitigation methods.- ImageNet-W overlays watermarks on ImageNet validation images to reveal a pervasive watermark shortcut that nearly all modern vision models rely on. Along with texture and background, ImageNet-W enables evaluating models on multiple naturally occurring shortcuts in ImageNet.2. Through extensive experiments on the new datasets, the paper reveals that mitigating one shortcut can amplify reliance on others in a "Whac-A-Mole" phenomenon. This is observed across various methods, including those designed for shortcut mitigation, and even large foundation models. 3. Proposing a new method called Last Layer Ensemble (LLE) that can mitigate multiple known shortcuts simultaneously without Whac-A-Mole behavior by training an ensemble of last layers with different augmentations and a distributional shift classifier.In summary, the key contribution is revealing the overlooked challenge of multi-shortcut mitigation through new datasets and models, as existing works make the tenuous assumption that only a single shortcut exists. The paper argues the community should move beyond this simplifying assumption to advance robust and reliable vision systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes new benchmarks revealing that computer vision models universally struggle to overcome multiple shortcuts in a "Whac-A-Mole" dilemma, where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others, and introduces a new method to mitigate multiple shortcuts jointly without this issue.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper makes several important contributions to the study of shortcut learning and mitigation in computer vision models:- It proposes two new datasets for evaluating multi-shortcut learning: UrbanCars and ImageNet-W. Previous datasets like Waterbirds have focused on a single spurious shortcut, but real-world images contain multiple shortcuts. These new datasets enable more rigorous testing of models' robustness to multiple shortcuts.- Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that many existing methods designed to mitigate shortcuts struggle when multiple shortcuts are present. This phenomenon is likened to a "Whac-A-Mole" game, where mitigating one shortcut can amplify reliance on others. This reveals that multi-shortcut mitigation remains an open challenge. - The paper proposes a new method, Last Layer Ensemble (LLE), to mitigate multiple known shortcuts without Whac-A-Mole behavior. LLE trains an ensemble of classifiers to handle different data augmentations targeting each shortcut type. A distribution shift classifier then dynamically aggregates predictions based on the predicted shortcut.- The paper tests shortcut mitigation methods much more extensively than prior works, evaluating not just specialized techniques but also standard regularization methods, self-supervised models, and foundation models. The ubiquity of the Whac-A-Mole problem is concerning.Overall, this paper significantly advances the study of robustness in vision systems by shifting focus to the overlooked but critical problem of multi-shortcut learning. The new datasets, extensive experiments, Whac-A-Mole characterization, and LLE approach help expose this problem and chart a path forward. This work highlights the need to move beyond simplified assumptions commonly made in prior shortcut research.
