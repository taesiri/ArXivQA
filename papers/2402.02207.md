# [Safety Fine-Tuning at (Almost) No Cost: A Baseline for Vision Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper addresses concerns around the potential for vision language models (VLLMs) to generate harmful content or be susceptible to attacks to elicit unsafe outputs. As VLLMs gain adoption, ensuring they remain helpful while mitigating risks is critical. 

The authors first analyzed how fine-tuning VLLMs can negatively impact safety compared to the underlying language models, finding the vision-language data contains some harmful content that affects alignment. They then created the first VLLM safety fine-tuning dataset called VLGuard, with training and test data across privacy, risky behaviors, deception and hate speech.

Two fine-tuning approaches with VLGuard were proposed - post-hoc after the VLLM is trained, or mixed directly into existing training. Experiments on models like LLaVA and MiniGPT show VLGuard fine-tuning significantly enhances safety - reducing attack success rates from upwards of 80% to nearly 0% on various adversarial datasets - with no loss in model helpfulness.

The key contributions are:
(1) Analysis showing how VLLM fine-tuning impacts safety of underlying LMs 
(2) New VLGuard safety fine-tuning dataset for VLLMs
(3) Demonstrating VLGuard's ability to improve safety with negligible impact on helpfulness
(4) Versatile dataset that can plug into existing training or post-hoc fine-tune pre-trained VLLMs

The VLGuard dataset enables safer VLLMs and provides a valuable resource for future research into robust VLLM alignment techniques that remain helpful while mitigating emerging risks.
