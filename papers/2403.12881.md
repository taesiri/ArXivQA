# [Agent-FLAN: Designing Data and Methods of Effective Agent Tuning for   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success on various NLP tasks, but still lag behind API models when acting as agents to accomplish real-world tasks. Integrating effective agent abilities into general purpose LLMs is an important challenge. 

Key Observations:
- Most agent training data deviates from LLMs' original pretraining domain (natural conversations), causing inadequate learning.  
- LLMs exhibit varying learning speeds on different capabilities needed for agent tasks.  
- Existing approaches overlook prevalent hallucination issues in agent model outputs.

Proposed Solution - Agent-FLAN:
- Aligns agent tuning data to natural chat format to focus learning on core agent abilities.  
- Explicitly decomposes tasks into capabilities (reasoning, retrieval etc) and balances training data based on model's learning rates.
- Constructs comprehensive benchmark "Agent-H" to measure hallucinations, and uses negative samples to mitigate.

Key Results:
- Agent-FLAN advances SOTA by 3.5% on Llama2-7B over prior works on held-out agent tasks.
- It greatly alleviates hallucination issues while maintaining performance.
- Analysis shows agent tuning brings improvements with model scaling, and also benefits general capabilities.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies key weaknesses in current agent tuning approaches via novel observations.
- Presents innovations in data/method design for integrating agent abilities into general LLMs. 
- Outperforms prior arts across agent tasks; comprehensive analyses provide insights.
