# [Can LLMs Produce Faithful Explanations For Fact-checking? Towards   Faithful Explainable Fact-Checking via Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact checking requires providing clear explanations to build user trust, but the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful explanations remains underexplored. 
- The paper investigates whether LLMs can generate faithful explanations for fact checking in a zero-shot prompting setup. Experiments prompting ChatGPT reveal that zero-shot prompting often fails, with 80% of explanations including hallucinated details.

Solution - Multi-Agent Debate Refinement (MADR):
- Proposed framework that uses multiple LLM agents in different roles in an iterative process to refine explanations and enhance faithfulness. 
- Roles include two Debaters to provide feedback, a Judge to determine consensus, and a Refiner to update the explanation based on the feedback. 
- Ensures rigorous validation of the final explanation from multiple perspectives, significantly reducing unfaithful elements.

Key Contributions:
- First study analyzing LLMs' ability to produce faithful fact checking explanations.
- Introduction of a novel typology defining common errors in LLM-generated explanations.
- Proposal of an effective MADR framework leveraging multi-agent debate to improve explanation faithfulness.
- Experiments demonstrate MADR substantially boosts faithfulness upon baselines.
- Analysis identifies most suitable LLM-based evaluation protocols for assessing faithfulness.

In summary, the paper tackles the important but understudied problem of improving faithfulness in LLM-generated explanations for fact checking. It makes multiple contributions, including the new MADR technique, which shows great promise in addressing this challenge.
