# [Can LLMs Produce Faithful Explanations For Fact-checking? Towards   Faithful Explainable Fact-Checking via Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fact checking requires providing clear explanations to build user trust, but the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate faithful explanations remains underexplored. 
- The paper investigates whether LLMs can generate faithful explanations for fact checking in a zero-shot prompting setup. Experiments prompting ChatGPT reveal that zero-shot prompting often fails, with 80% of explanations including hallucinated details.

Solution - Multi-Agent Debate Refinement (MADR):
- Proposed framework that uses multiple LLM agents in different roles in an iterative process to refine explanations and enhance faithfulness. 
- Roles include two Debaters to provide feedback, a Judge to determine consensus, and a Refiner to update the explanation based on the feedback. 
- Ensures rigorous validation of the final explanation from multiple perspectives, significantly reducing unfaithful elements.

Key Contributions:
- First study analyzing LLMs' ability to produce faithful fact checking explanations.
- Introduction of a novel typology defining common errors in LLM-generated explanations.
- Proposal of an effective MADR framework leveraging multi-agent debate to improve explanation faithfulness.
- Experiments demonstrate MADR substantially boosts faithfulness upon baselines.
- Analysis identifies most suitable LLM-based evaluation protocols for assessing faithfulness.

In summary, the paper tackles the important but understudied problem of improving faithfulness in LLM-generated explanations for fact checking. It makes multiple contributions, including the new MADR technique, which shows great promise in addressing this challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Debate Refinement (MADR) framework that leverages multiple LLMs with diverse roles to iteratively debate and refine explanations for fact-checking, significantly enhancing their faithfulness compared to simpler prompting methods or self-refinement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It presents the first study of large language models' (LLMs) ability to produce faithful fact-checking explanations. 

2. It presents Multi-Agent Debate Refinement, an effective framework to produce faithful explanations based on iterative debating among LLMs.

3. The correlation analysis reveals the most suitable LLM-based evaluation protocol for assessing the faithfulness of generated explanations for fact-checking.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a new method (Multi-Agent Debate Refinement) for improving the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations for fact-checking. The paper also provides the first analysis on this problem and identifies the best automatic evaluation approach.

The paper examines the ability of large language models to generate faithful, trustworthy explanations for fact-checking, especially in complex, multi-hop scenarios. It finds LLMs often produce unfaithful explanations in zero-shot settings. To address this, the authors propose a Multi-Agent Debate Refinement framework that uses multiple LLMs with different roles to iteratively debate, provide feedback, and refine explanations to enhance faithfulness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Debate Refinement (MADR) framework. What are the key advantages of using a multi-agent setup compared to relying on a single refiner agent? How does debate between agents help enhance faithfulness?

2. The MADR framework utilizes two debater agents, one judge agent and one refiner agent. What are the distinct roles and responsibilities assigned to each of these agents? How do they collaborate in the overall refinement process?  

3. What prompts are provided to the two debater agents in MADR to ensure they identify different types of potential errors in the generated explanations? How does this promote comprehensive error analysis?

4. Explain the debating and judgment process in detail. How many iterations of debate occur and when does the judge determine agreement has been reached between debaters? What is the criteria for stopping further debate iterations?

5. Once the debaters reach a consensus on identified errors, how is the accumulated feedback utilized by the refiner agent to enhance the explanation's faithfulness? Does the refiner make revisions beyond just addressing the feedback? 

6. Why does the MADR framework opt for an iterative debating approach instead of directly refining the explanation within the debate itself? What are the advantages of using the debate mainly for feedback generation?

7. How adaptable is the MADR framework to incorporating additional debater agents beyond just two? Could the error identification and overall faithfulness be further improved with more debating perspectives? What might be some limitations?

8. The paper evaluates MADR performance using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. What key insights did the human evaluation provide that the automatic metrics failed to capture adequately? What were the implications from this analysis?

9. Based on the correlation analysis between human judgments and the automatic evaluation protocols, what recommendations does the paper suggest for reliable LLM-based faithfulness assessments in future work?

10. The MADR framework relies entirely on large language models currently. Do you think incorporating non-LLM based debating agents could provide additional value? What kind of agents might be worth exploring?
