# [Aalap: AI Assistant for Legal &amp; Paralegal Functions in India](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01758)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI for legal tasks has challenges like data privacy issues, need for domain-specific knowledge, and cost of hosting large models. 
- There is a need for smaller, specialized models that can perform well on specific Indian legal tasks.
- Existing benchmarks to evaluate legal reasoning abilities of models are based on US law.

Proposed Solution:
- Created Aalap model - a 7B parameter Mistral model fine-tuned on instruction-based legal datasets using parameter-efficient methods.  
- Aalap instruction dataset covers tasks like issue generation, argument generation, event timeline creation based on Indian court judgments and FIRs. 
- Used real legal documents and synthetic responses from OpenAI where actual data was not available.
- Focused on teaching legal reasoning rather than just recall.

Main Contributions:
- Aalap instruction dataset with over 22K examples on 11 Indian legal tasks.
- Aalap model hosted on HuggingFace that can handle longer texts.
- Evaluation using GPT-4 evaluator shows Aalap performs better than GPT-3.5 Turbo on 31% of test data. 
- Analysis on AIBE exam data and LegalBench data shows areas of improvement.

The paper demonstrates specialized fine-tuning of smaller models can give good performance on specific tasks while being cost-effective. Next steps are to improve data quality, evaluate real-world performance, support Indian languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Aalap, a 7B parameter Mistral model fine-tuned on a dataset of over 22,000 instructions and responses for Indian legal tasks, which outperforms GPT-3.5 Turbo on 31% of a test set when evaluated by GPT-4.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Aalap instructions dataset: 22272 legal instructions and synthetically generated responses with a maximum input token length of 16k.

2) Aalap model: 7B Mistral model fine-tuned on the Aalap dataset with a maximum context length of 32k which can perform well for specific legal tasks in Indian context. 

3) AIBE data: AIBE dataset containing 1158 multiple-choice questions and answers from past 12 AIBE exams.

So in summary, the key contributions are:

- Aalap instructions dataset for legal tasks
- Aalap fine-tuned model for legal tasks
- AIBE dataset for evaluating legal models

The paper introduces these new datasets and model to help develop AI assistants for legal and paralegal functions, with a focus on the Indian context.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method for fine-tuning. Can you explain in more detail how LoRA works and why it was chosen over other fine-tuning methods? 

2. The training infrastructure utilized 4 X A100 80GB GPUs. What considerations went into determining the appropriate hardware configuration and compute resources for training?

3. The maximum token length was set to 16384 during training. How was this length determined? What impact does the maximum token length have on model training and performance?

4. Flash attention was used to enhance training speed. Can you explain how flash attention works and why it improves training efficiency? What are the tradeoffs?

5. What validation methodology was used during training to track model performance? How frequently was validation conducted and what metrics were monitored? 

6. The paper mentions using "Deepseed stage 3" during training. What is deepseed and what advantages does it provide? Why was stage 3 chosen?

7. How was the learning rate schedule and other key hyperparameters like batch size, weight decay etc. determined? What guidelines or methodologies were followed?

8. The model was trained for 6500 steps equating to 10 epochs. What informed this decision? What criteria was used to determine when to stop training?

9. The trained model is compared to GPT-3.5 Turbo. What are the key architectural and capability differences between these two models? Why choose GPT-3.5 Turbo as a baseline?

10. The trained model does not perform as well on few-shot tasks. Why does fine-tuning impact few-shot ability and how can this issue be mitigated?
