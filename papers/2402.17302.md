# [Can LLM Generate Culturally Relevant Commonsense QA Data? Case Study in   Indonesian and Sundanese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17302)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- It is unclear whether current large language models (LLMs) can generate high-quality question answering (QA) datasets that incorporate cultural knowledge and nuances for non-English languages, especially lower-resource languages like Indonesian and Sundanese.  

Methods:
- The authors create new Indonesian and Sundanese commonsense QA datasets using various methods:
   - Adapting existing English CSQA data via LLMs
   - Manually creating datasets using human annotators from diverse Indonesian regions
   - Using LLMs like GPT-4 to automatically generate datasets
- The final dataset contains ~3K LLM-generated and ~1.5K human-generated QA pairs per language.

Analysis and Findings:  
- LLMs can adequately adapt English concepts into Indonesian but struggle with Sundanese translation.
- GPT-4 can generate Indonesian questions with basic local knowledge when provided categories/concepts by humans. But it produces errors in Sundanese, showing worse performance for lower-resource languages.
- Humans create more diverse questions/options compared to LLMs.
- LLMs perform better on LLM-generated test sets compared to human-created ones, revealing dataset limitations.

Contributions:
- New largest Indonesian and Sundanese commonsense QA dataset created via both LLMs and human annotators.
- Analysis of LLM effectiveness in generating culturally-relevant QA data for medium-resource (Indonesian) and low-resource (Sundanese) languages.
- Benchmark of various LLMs on the new datasets.

The paper highlights issues in utilizing current LLMs for generating meaningful non-English QA data and creates resources to facilitate related research.
