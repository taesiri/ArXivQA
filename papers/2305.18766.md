# [HiFA: High-fidelity Text-to-3D with Advanced Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18766)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How can we improve upon existing text-to-3D synthesis methods to generate 3D assets with higher fidelity and greater consistency across multiple views? The authors note limitations in prior work such as Dreamfusion and Magic3D, which rely on 2D diffusion models to optimize 3D representations like NeRFs. These methods can result in artifacts and inconsistencies across views due to the diffusion models' limited understanding of 3D geometry. To address this, the authors propose several key enhancements:1) A reformulation of the diffusion model's optimization loss to use image residuals rather than noise residuals.2) A new time step annealing approach during training to gradually reduce noise levels.3) Additional supervision for the NeRFs through depth prediction and density regularization to improve geometry.The central hypothesis is that these improvements will allow for higher quality 3D asset generation from text prompts, with improved photo-realism and multi-view consistency compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.In summary, the key research question is how to enhance existing diffusion-guided text-to-3D synthesis approaches, and the central hypothesis is that the authors' proposed methodological improvements will achieve superior fidelity and consistency for this task.
