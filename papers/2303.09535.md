# [FateZero: Fusing Attentions for Zero-shot Text-based Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09535)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is how to apply diffusion-based generative models for real-world visual content editing, especially for videos. 

The key points I gathered are:

- Diffusion-based models have shown success in generating high-quality images and videos from text prompts. 

- However, it is challenging to apply them for real-world visual content editing due to the randomness in the generation process.

- The paper proposes a new method called FateZero for zero-shot text-based editing of real videos, without needing per-prompt training or user-provided masks.

- The key ideas are: 1) Capturing and fusing intermediate attention maps during inversion to retain motion and structure information. 2) Using cross-attention maps as masks during attention fusion to prevent semantic leakage. 3) Reforming self-attention to ensure frame consistency.

- The method enables style, attribute, and shape editing of real videos using pre-trained image and video diffusion models.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by strategically capturing and fusing attention maps during the inversion and generation process, diffusion models can be adapted for consistent video editing without additional per-prompt tuning. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new zero-shot text-based video editing method called FateZero. The key ideas are:

- Using intermediate attention maps from the inversion process to retain motion and structure information, rather than just relying on inversion and generation. 

- Blending self-attentions with a mask obtained from cross-attention to prevent semantic leakage from the source video and improve shape editing.

- Reformulating self-attention to spatial-temporal attention to improve frame consistency in videos.

Overall, the paper presents the first framework for temporal-consistent zero-shot text-based video editing using pre-trained image diffusion models, without needing per-prompt training or user-specific masks. The method shows applications in video style editing, attribute editing, and shape-aware object editing.

In summary, the main novelty is in designing techniques to adapt image diffusion models for temporally consistent video editing in a zero-shot manner, by using and remixing attention maps in creative ways during inversion and generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FateZero, a new method for zero-shot text-driven video editing that achieves temporal consistency by fusing attention maps from the inversion and generation stages of the diffusion model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in text-based video editing:

- This paper presents a zero-shot approach to text-based editing of real videos using pre-trained diffusion models, without needing per-prompt fine-tuning or user masks. Most prior work requires per-prompt optimization or tuning to edit videos. The zero-shot capability is novel.

- The method utilizes intermediate attention maps from the inversion process to help preserve motion and structure during editing. Other recent works tend to rely solely on inversion and generation, which can lead to temporally inconsistent results when applied framewise to video. The use of intermediate inversion attention is a new technique.

- For shape-aware editing, the method shows improved results compared to naive application of DDIM inversion to a pre-trained one-shot video diffusion model. This demonstrates the benefits of their proposed attention blending approach for challenging shape editing tasks.

- The ability to leverage widely available pre-trained image diffusion models, rather than requiring fine-tuned video-specific models, is notable. This could enable broader applications by building on existing image generative priors.

- For evaluation, the paper presents comparison to optimization-based baselines using neural metrics and human judgments. The results demonstrate improved temporal consistency and editing quality over the baselines.

Overall, the zero-shot capability, use of inversion attention, and generative editing results seem to advance text-based video editing research. The method appears to outperform previous approaches reliant on per-prompt optimization or fine-tuning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing the proposed method on publicly available large-scale video diffusion models once they become available, to further evaluate and improve the editing capabilities. The current work relies on image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and video methods based on injecting temporal information into them. Applying the approach to full video diffusion models could enhance the diversity of possible edits and motion generation.

- Extending the method to other pretrained image/video diffusion models besides Stable Diffusion, such as Imagen Video, Make-A-Video, etc. The authors propose their approach as a general editing framework applicable to various models. Evaluating on more diffusion models would verify the generalization.

- Investigating possibilities for generating completely novel motions and shapes during editing, instead of relying primarily on the motions in the input video. The current approach struggles with large shape/motion differences between input and target (e.g. swan to pterosaur). Stronger generative video priors could help achieve more significant out-of-distribution editing.

- Considering additional applications of the method, such as video super-resolution, inpainting, etc. The authors demonstrate promising results for object removal and enhancement in limited experiments. More applications could be enabled by the proposed spatial-temporal attention manipulation framework.

- Developing interactive video editing interfaces leveraging the zero-shot text-driven editing capability. The fast inference could enable real-time preview and iterative refinement of edits through natural language prompts.

In summary, the main suggested directions are applying the approach to true video diffusion models, evaluating on more model architectures, enhancing the editing diversity, and exploring more applications and interfaces for video manipulation. Advancing generative video modeling seems key to unlocking the full potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FateZero, a zero-shot text-based video editing method that can edit the style, attributes, and shape of real-world videos using pretrained diffusion models without requiring per-prompt training or user-provided masks. FateZero stores the attention maps during video inversion and replaces them during the denoising steps to provide motion and structure guidance. It uses cross-attention maps as blending masks to prevent semantic leakage from the source video and improve shape editing. FateZero also reforms the self-attention blocks to spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency. Experiments show FateZero can directly edit real videos for style and attribute changes using pretrained image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. With video diffusion models like Tune-A-Video, it also enables better shape-aware editing than simple DDIM inversion. FateZero provides an effective way to leverage powerful pretrained generative models for consistent video editing without tedious per-video tuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FateZero, a new zero-shot text-driven video editing framework that performs temporal consistent editing of attributes, style, and shape. FateZero makes use of self-attention and cross-attention maps from the diffusion model's encoder during the inversion process. It stores these attention maps and then replaces them during the diffusion model's decoder denoising steps. This allows FateZero to preserve motion and structure information from the original video while still enabling editing driven by the new text prompt. A key contribution is the Attention Blending Block which utilizes the source prompt's cross-attention map as a spatial mask during attention remixing. This helps prevent semantic leakage from the original video and improves the shape editing capability. The method is evaluated on style, attribute, and shape editing tasks. It shows improved temporal consistency and editing quality compared to previous video and image editing techniques.

The core ideas behind FateZero are: 1) Storing and remixing attention maps from inversion helps retain motion and structure better than just using the latent vector. 2) Using cross-attention as a spatial mask when blending self-attentions prevents semantic leakage and improves shape editing. 3) Converting self-attentions to spatial-temporal helps ensure frame consistency. The extensive experiments demonstrate applications in video style editing, attribute editing, and shape-aware editing. Both qualitative and quantitative results show FateZero's superior temporal consistency and editing quality versus previous methods. The ability to do zero-shot editing on real videos with a pretrained image diffusion model is a notable achievement. Limitations include difficulty with large motion and shape changes. Overall, it is an effective framework for temporal consistent text-driven video editing.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes FateZero, a zero-shot text-based video editing framework that performs temporal consistent editing of attributes, styles, and shapes. The key idea is to store and utilize the intermediate self-attention and cross-attention maps during the DDIM inversion process. Specifically, the self-attention maps retain motion and structure information which is fused during the DDIM denoising to ensure consistency. The cross-attention maps provide spatial layout guidance for blending self-attentions to minimize semantic leakage from the source video. Additionally, the framework reforms the self-attention blocks to spatial-temporal blocks to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. By replacing and remixing the attention maps between inversion and generation, FateZero enables direct editing of real-world videos using pretrained image diffusion models, with applications in video style transfer, attribute editing, and shape manipulation demonstrated.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of editing real-world videos using diffusion models that are trained only for text-to-image generation. Specifically, it focuses on the problem of how to achieve temporally consistent editing of video styles, attributes, and object shapes in a zero-shot manner without per-prompt training or user-provided masks. 

Some key problems/questions the paper tries to tackle:

- Existing diffusion models like Stable Diffusion are trained only for image generation and lack temporal awareness to ensure consistency across frames when applied to video. How can they be adapted for temporally consistent video editing?

- Previous diffusion-based image editing methods rely on inverting images to latent codes and then generating edited images from the inverted codes. But directly applying this pipeline to videos can cause flickering and inconsistency between frames due to error accumulation in the inversion process. How can this issue be addressed?

- For tasks like shape-aware object editing in video, specialized video diffusion models are needed. But publicly available models are lacking. How can video editing be achieved using widely available image diffusion models?

- Most prior video/image editing methods require per-prompt tuning or user-provided masks. How can consistent video editing be achieved in a zero-shot manner without such constraints?

- How can motion, structure, and semantics from the input video be retained during the editing process for temporal consistency while still allowing style/attribute/shape changes?

So in summary, the key focus is on enabling temporally consistent, zero-shot text-based editing of real videos using pretrained image diffusion models, which is a challenging problem previously unsolved. The proposed FateZero method aims to address these challenges.
