# [FateZero: Fusing Attentions for Zero-shot Text-based Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09535)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is how to apply diffusion-based generative models for real-world visual content editing, especially for videos. The key points I gathered are:- Diffusion-based models have shown success in generating high-quality images and videos from text prompts. - However, it is challenging to apply them for real-world visual content editing due to the randomness in the generation process.- The paper proposes a new method called FateZero for zero-shot text-based editing of real videos, without needing per-prompt training or user-provided masks.- The key ideas are: 1) Capturing and fusing intermediate attention maps during inversion to retain motion and structure information. 2) Using cross-attention maps as masks during attention fusion to prevent semantic leakage. 3) Reforming self-attention to ensure frame consistency.- The method enables style, attribute, and shape editing of real videos using pre-trained image and video diffusion models.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by strategically capturing and fusing attention maps during the inversion and generation process, diffusion models can be adapted for consistent video editing without additional per-prompt tuning. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new zero-shot text-based video editing method called FateZero. The key ideas are:- Using intermediate attention maps from the inversion process to retain motion and structure information, rather than just relying on inversion and generation. - Blending self-attentions with a mask obtained from cross-attention to prevent semantic leakage from the source video and improve shape editing.- Reformulating self-attention to spatial-temporal attention to improve frame consistency in videos.Overall, the paper presents the first framework for temporal-consistent zero-shot text-based video editing using pre-trained image diffusion models, without needing per-prompt training or user-specific masks. The method shows applications in video style editing, attribute editing, and shape-aware object editing.In summary, the main novelty is in designing techniques to adapt image diffusion models for temporally consistent video editing in a zero-shot manner, by using and remixing attention maps in creative ways during inversion and generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes FateZero, a new method for zero-shot text-driven video editing that achieves temporal consistency by fusing attention maps from the inversion and generation stages of the diffusion model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in text-based video editing:- This paper presents a zero-shot approach to text-based editing of real videos using pre-trained diffusion models, without needing per-prompt fine-tuning or user masks. Most prior work requires per-prompt optimization or tuning to edit videos. The zero-shot capability is novel.- The method utilizes intermediate attention maps from the inversion process to help preserve motion and structure during editing. Other recent works tend to rely solely on inversion and generation, which can lead to temporally inconsistent results when applied framewise to video. The use of intermediate inversion attention is a new technique.- For shape-aware editing, the method shows improved results compared to naive application of DDIM inversion to a pre-trained one-shot video diffusion model. This demonstrates the benefits of their proposed attention blending approach for challenging shape editing tasks.- The ability to leverage widely available pre-trained image diffusion models, rather than requiring fine-tuned video-specific models, is notable. This could enable broader applications by building on existing image generative priors.- For evaluation, the paper presents comparison to optimization-based baselines using neural metrics and human judgments. The results demonstrate improved temporal consistency and editing quality over the baselines.Overall, the zero-shot capability, use of inversion attention, and generative editing results seem to advance text-based video editing research. The method appears to outperform previous approaches reliant on per-prompt optimization or fine-tuning.
