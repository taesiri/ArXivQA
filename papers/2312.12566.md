# [Johnsen-Rahbek Capstan Clutch: A High Torque Electrostatic Clutch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12566)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Clutches are important components in robotic systems to reduce weight and power consumption. However, conventional clutches have limitations in generating high enough holding torques needed in many applications while maintaining low size, weight and power.  

- Electrostatic clutches can operate at low power but have had limited ability to generate the required holding torques or shear stresses. 

- Combining the exponential torque scaling of the capstan effect with electrostatic adhesion could improve performance but had limited previous demonstration.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a new electrostatic clutch design that combines the Johnsen-Rahbek (JR) effect with the capstan effect in a multi-wrap configuration, called the JR-effect capstan clutch (JRCC). 

- A theoretical model is derived that governs the behavior of the JRCC, capturing the contributions of both the JR electrostatic adhesion forces and the capstan effect over multiple wraps.

- A clutch prototype is designed and fabricated using a stainless steel band wrapped around a polybenzimidazole (PBI) dielectric shaft. Both thin (25.4 μm) and thick (76.2 μm) steel bands are tested.

Contributions:
- The designed JRCC can generate a maximum holding torque of 7.1 N·m while consuming only 2.5 mW/cm2, representing the highest specific shear stress reported.

- First demonstration of unfilled PBI polymer exhibiting the JR effect for electrostatic adhesion.

- Experimental validation of the theoretical JRCC model over varying wrap angles and input tensions.

- Analysis and demonstration of the exponential advantage of the JRCC design over an equivalent planar electrostatic clutch.

- Evaluation of the effects of band thickness, surface finish and wrap angle on the efficiency and torque capacity.

In summary, the paper presents a novel electrostatic clutch design that can achieve significantly higher torque capacity than prior electrostatic devices, enabled by the combined capstan and JR effects. The design is thoroughly modeled and validated experimentally.
