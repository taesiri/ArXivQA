# [VGFlow: Visibility guided Flow Network for Human Reposing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08540)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research contributions appear to be:

1) Proposing a new deep learning framework (VGFlow) for high-quality human image reposing guided by a target pose. 

2) A visibility-guided flow module to disentangle visible and invisible regions of the person for simultaneous texture preservation and style manipulation.

3) A self-supervised patch-wise "realness" loss to handle varying body shapes and reduce artifacts.

The key research question seems to be: How can we generate realistic and high-quality reposing of humans in arbitrary target poses, while properly handling issues like texture preservation, pattern coherence, cloth boundaries, occlusions, skin generation, etc? 

The paper hypothesizes that explicitly modeling the visibility of regions, using separate flows for visible/invisible parts, and adding an adversarial realness loss will allow their proposed VGFlow framework to address the challenges better than previous methods. The experiments aim to validate if their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on human image reposing.
