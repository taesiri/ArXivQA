# [VGFlow: Visibility guided Flow Network for Human Reposing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08540)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research contributions appear to be:

1) Proposing a new deep learning framework (VGFlow) for high-quality human image reposing guided by a target pose. 

2) A visibility-guided flow module to disentangle visible and invisible regions of the person for simultaneous texture preservation and style manipulation.

3) A self-supervised patch-wise "realness" loss to handle varying body shapes and reduce artifacts.

The key research question seems to be: How can we generate realistic and high-quality reposing of humans in arbitrary target poses, while properly handling issues like texture preservation, pattern coherence, cloth boundaries, occlusions, skin generation, etc? 

The paper hypothesizes that explicitly modeling the visibility of regions, using separate flows for visible/invisible parts, and adding an adversarial realness loss will allow their proposed VGFlow framework to address the challenges better than previous methods. The experiments aim to validate if their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on human image reposing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this CVPR paper appear to be:

1. A novel visibility-guided appearance flow prediction module to disentangle visible and invisible regions of the person image in the target pose. 

2. An image decoder employing multi-scale texture modulated pose encoding.

3. A patch-wise adversarial objective to improve output realism and reduce artifacts.

4. Achieving state-of-the-art results on image quality metrics for the human reposing task, through the proposed model called VGFlow.

5. Extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis comparing to previous baselines.

6. Ablation studies demonstrating the importance of different components of their pipeline.

The key ideas seem to be using visibility information to guide the flow prediction and warping of the source image, handling visible and invisible regions separately, and incorporating a patch adversarial loss for improved realism. The proposed VGFlow model outperforms prior work in human reposing/reposing according to the quantitative image metrics and qualitative examples presented.
