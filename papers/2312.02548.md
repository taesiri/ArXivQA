# [GeNIe: Generative Hard Negative Images Through Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02548)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GeNIe, a novel data augmentation method that generates hard negatives to improve model training. GeNIe leverages a text-conditioned diffusion model to merge a source image from one category with a text prompt suggesting a different target category. By controlling the amount of noise and diffusion iterations, GeNIe generates images sharing low-level features with the source image while representing the target category semantics. These images act as challenging examples lying close to the decision boundary, making them effective hard negatives for augmentation. Through extensive experiments on few-shot learning, long-tail distribution, and fine-grained image classification, the authors demonstrate GeNIe's ability to enhance training, especially for categories with limited data. The method outperforms baselines using traditional augmentations and text-to-image generation alone. A key insight is determining the appropriate noise level to balance retaining source image information and incorporating the target category prompt when reversing the diffusion process. Overall, GeNIe presents an innovative augmentation approach exploiting recent advances in generative models to synthesize hard negatives guiding improved model learning.
