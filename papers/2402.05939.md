# [Uncertainty Awareness of Large Language Models Under Code Distribution   Shifts: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05939)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on programming language analysis tasks. However, their reliability can degrade under various code distribution shifts that commonly occur in real-world scenarios, such as changes in library versions over time, shifts across projects with similar functionality, or changes in coding style from new developers' contributions. This issue of unreliable predictions undershifts is related to models' lack of uncertainty awareness and calibration. 

Proposed Solution:  
This paper proposes evaluating state-of-the-art probabilistic methods for improving the uncertainty calibration and estimation of CodeLlama model under three realistic code distribution shift patterns (timeline, project, author) with varying intensities. Specifically, methods like Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, Mutation Testing, Dissector and Temperature Scaling are adapted and studied. The uncertainty awareness is assessed via expected calibration error, selective prediction, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection experiments.

Main Contributions:
- A large-scale benchmark dataset is introduced, consisting of Java code snippets extracted from open-source projects, aligned to three shift patterns at multiple intensities.

- A comprehensive study of various probabilistic methods' impact on CodeLlama's prediction quality under distribution shifts is presented. The findings reveal these methods generally improve calibration and uncertainty estimation.

- The analysis also uncovers variability in performance across different evaluation criteria (e.g. calibration error vs selective prediction) and shifts intensities. This highlights the need to select appropriate methods based on context.

- A trade-off is demonstrated between uncertainty estimation efficacy and computational efficiency. This underscores choosing suitable techniques based on practical requirements.

In summary, this is the first work to systematically assess uncertainty calibration techniques for LLMs on programming languages under real-world distribution shifts. The benchmark dataset and analysis of methodological nuances provide a strong foundation for improving reliability of models in code analysis.
