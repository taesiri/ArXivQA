# [A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-modal Conversational Emotion Recognition   with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multi-modal conversational emotion recognition (MCER) aims to recognize emotions expressed in conversations using multiple modalities like text, audio, and video. MCER is challenging as it needs to model complex emotional interactions between speakers over long contexts across modalities. However, there is a lack of a systematic taxonomy and review of MCER methods, especially those based on deep learning.  

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and review of deep learning based MCER methods. The key aspects covered are:

1) Popular MCER Datasets: Summarizes 7 widely used benchmarks like IEMOCAP, MELD, SEMAINE etc.

2) Feature Extraction: Reviews commonly used techniques to extract features from text, audio and video modalities. 

3) Taxonomy of Methods: Classifies MCER techniques into 4 categories - context-free modeling, sequential context modeling, distinguishing speaker modeling and speaker relationship modeling.

4) Experimental Analysis: Compares performance of different categories of methods on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets. Context modeling and speaker relationship modeling achieve the best performance.

5) Applications: Discusses usecases of MCER in social media analysis, healthcare, recommendations systems etc.  

6) Challenges: Analyzes key open issues like scarcity of training data, heterogeneous and noisy data, unbalanced distributions etc. that limit accuracy of current MCER models.

7) Future Directions: Suggests promising research avenues in multi-modal data generation, deep feature fusion, incomplete MCER, zero-shot MCER etc.

Main Contributions:

- Provides the first comprehensive taxonomy and review of deep learning based MCER models, covering datasets, feature extraction, techniques, experiments, applications, challenges and future work.

- Organizes a wide variety of MCER techniques into 4 modeling categories to enable better understanding. 

- Analyzes limitations of current models and suggests multiple future research directions for the community.

The paper delivers a timely, structured and thorough overview of the MCER literature. By covering the breadth of the field in a single source, it can significantly aid researchers and developers working on emotion recognition models using multi-modal conversational data.
