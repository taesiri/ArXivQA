# [A novel data generation scheme for surrogate modelling with deep   operator networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Operator learning methods like DeepONets show promise for surrogate modeling of physical systems by learning the mapping between input and output functions. However, generating training data is computationally expensive as it requires numerically solving PDEs using methods like FEM. This hinders the practical deployment of DeepONets.

Proposed Solution:  
- The key idea is that for a PDE, it is easier to compute derivatives from a given field compared to integrating the PDE to obtain the field. 
- A novel data generation strategy is proposed that first randomly generates the output field using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), satisfying specified boundary conditions. 
- The corresponding input field is then calculated from the output field using finite difference methods, without needing to solve the PDE.

- For homogeneous boundary conditions, GPR with a single length scale parameter generates satisfactory fields.  
- For heterogeneous BCs, a two length-scale approach is proposed:
   (i) A heterogeneous field satisfying BC using large length scale
   (ii) Homogeneous fields with small length scale
   (iii) Adding (i) and (ii)

Main Contributions:

- A computationally cheaper way to generate input-output pairs for training DeepONets without needing expensive PDE solvers.
- Applicable to arbitrary domains and variety of boundary conditions.
- Demonstrated for heat equation on square, triangular, annular domains with constant/varying conductivity.
- Will allow more practical deployment of DeepONets and other operator learning methods for surrogate modeling.

In summary, the paper makes data generation for operator learning more efficient by cleverly using GPR and finite-differences, instead of solving PDEs numerically. This facilitates the adoption of methods like DeepONets for surrogate modeling.
