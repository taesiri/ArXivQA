# [UniControl: A Unified Diffusion Model for Controllable Visual Generation   In the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11147)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: How to develop a unified diffusion model that can handle diverse visual conditions and achieve controllable image generation, while still being adaptable to new unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner.The key points are:- The paper proposes UniControl, a novel unified diffusion model for controllable visual generation. - UniControl can accommodate pixel-level precise control using various visual conditions like edges, maps, skeletons etc. At the same time, it allows flexible high-level control through text prompts.- The model is designed to handle diverse visual control tasks within a single framework through the use of a Mixture of Experts (MOE) adapter and a task-aware HyperNet.- UniControl is trained on a large dataset of over 20M images covering 9 different control tasks.- Experiments demonstrate UniControl's ability to outperform single task models and also generalize to unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner.In summary, the central hypothesis is that a properly designed unified diffusion model can achieve multi-tasking on diverse control tasks while retaining zero-shot adaptability, which UniControl aims to demonstrate.
