# [Is a PET all you need? A multi-modal study for Alzheimer's disease using   3D CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02094)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that fusing structural MRI (sMRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) does not improve classification accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to using FDG-PET alone. The authors note that several previous studies have shown improved AD classification accuracy when combining sMRI and FDG-PET with deep learning models. However, this conflicts with established clinical knowledge that FDG-PET better captures AD-specific pathologies compared to sMRI. To test their hypothesis, the authors evaluate single- and multi-modal deep neural networks using sMRI, FDG-PET, and combined sMRI+FDG-PET for binary AD classification. Through several experiments, they demonstrate that FDG-PET alone performs best, matching clinical intuition.In summary, the central hypothesis is that multi-modal fusion of sMRI and FDG-PET does not improve AD classification accuracy over FDG-PET alone, contradicting some previous deep learning literature but confirming clinical knowledge about the utility of these modalities. The authors test this via systematic experiments with uni- and multi-modal networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposes a framework for systematically evaluating multi-modal deep neural networks to determine the contribution of each modality. This includes training on correct paired data, as well as on random/mismatched modalities.- Critically re-evaluates single vs multi-modal deep neural networks for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using MRI and FDG-PET. Experiments show that FDG-PET alone performs best, conforming with clinical knowledge that it better captures AD patterns. - Argues that most prior work on multi-modal fusion for AD is disconnected from clinical knowledge and does not properly evaluate modality contributions.- Suggests future multi-modal fusion work should follow their evaluation framework to assess modality importance. Also suggests moving beyond binary classification to differential dementia diagnosis where multi-modal fusion aligns more with clinical need.In summary, the key contribution is a rigorous framework to evaluate multi-modal neural networks, which is applied to question the value of MRI+PET fusion for AD diagnosis specifically. The results conform more with established clinical knowledge and highlight issues in prior work.
