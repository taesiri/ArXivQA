# [Is a PET all you need? A multi-modal study for Alzheimer's disease using   3D CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02094)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that fusing structural MRI (sMRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) does not improve classification accuracy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to using FDG-PET alone. The authors note that several previous studies have shown improved AD classification accuracy when combining sMRI and FDG-PET with deep learning models. However, this conflicts with established clinical knowledge that FDG-PET better captures AD-specific pathologies compared to sMRI. To test their hypothesis, the authors evaluate single- and multi-modal deep neural networks using sMRI, FDG-PET, and combined sMRI+FDG-PET for binary AD classification. Through several experiments, they demonstrate that FDG-PET alone performs best, matching clinical intuition.In summary, the central hypothesis is that multi-modal fusion of sMRI and FDG-PET does not improve AD classification accuracy over FDG-PET alone, contradicting some previous deep learning literature but confirming clinical knowledge about the utility of these modalities. The authors test this via systematic experiments with uni- and multi-modal networks.
