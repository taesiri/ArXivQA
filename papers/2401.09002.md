# [AttackEval: How to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Jailbreak Attacking on   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09002)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces two enhanced evaluation frameworks (a revised coarse-grained and a fine-grained evaluation) along with a comprehensive ground truth dataset to assess the effectiveness of attack prompts used to coerce large language models into generating prohibited content.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The development of two innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing attack prompts in jailbreak tasks: a coarse-grained evaluation matrix and a fine-grained evaluation matrix. These introduce a nuanced scaling system from 0 to 1 to evaluate the effectiveness of attack strategies.

2. The creation of a comprehensive ground truth dataset that establishes a benchmark for evaluating jailbreak attack prompts. This encompasses diverse attack scenarios and prompt variations, enabling thorough and consistent assessment of LLM responses across models.

In summary, the key contributions are new multi-faceted evaluation approaches and a tailored dataset to enable more accurate and comparative analysis of attack prompt effectiveness on large language models.

The paper introduces two new evaluation frameworks - a coarse-grained framework and a fine-grained framework - to assess the effectiveness of attack prompts used in jailbreaking large language models. It also develops a comprehensive ground truth dataset tailored for jailbreak tasks to serve as a benchmark. The key focus areas are evaluating attack prompts, understanding model vulnerabilities, measuring attack success rates, and comparing new evaluation approaches to traditional binary metrics of success/failure.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these two frameworks and how they offer complementary perspectives? 

2. The coarse-grained evaluation matrix incorporates a weighting system to account for different robustness levels of models. Can you explain the methodology used to calculate these model weights? How does this weighting process enhance the accuracy of the coarse-grained evaluation?

3. The fine-grained evaluation is conducted both with and without ground truth data. What is the motivation behind evaluating the attack prompts from these two angles? What unique insights does each approach provide?

4. The paper states that the ground truth dataset encompasses a diverse range of attack scenarios and prompt variations. What were some of the key considerations and selection criteria when curating this dataset? 

5. When calculating effectiveness scores using ground truth data, the maximum similarity score is selected from a set of 3 ground truth responses. What is the rationale behind using 3 ground truth responses instead of just 1? How does this method improve the reliability of the evaluation?

6. In the fine-grained evaluation without ground truth, a specialized scoring system with only 4 options is introduced. Why is this condensed scoring approach suitable for scenarios without ground truth availability? What are its limitations?

7. The paper discovers that attack prompts for “Political Lobbying” consistently achieve high effectiveness scores. What factors might contribute to the higher susceptibility of models under this category? 

8. Between the coarse-grained and fine-grained evaluation approaches, which framework enables easier detection of model vulnerabilities that could be exploitable by attackers? What are the trade-offs?

9. The correlation analysis reveals alignment between the proposed evaluation methods and the baseline. However, the effectiveness scores for individual attack prompts vary considerably. What might account for these scoring differences at the granular level?

10. Could components of the proposed evaluation frameworks be applicable for assessing vulnerabilities beyond just jailbreak attacks? What are some examples of other security issues for Large Language Models that could leverage these methods?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 I have read through the paper and summarized the key points below:

The paper proposes novel methods to evaluate the effectiveness of attack prompts used to try to coerce large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into generating harmful content that violates their safety policies. 

The authors argue that most prior work has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs to attacks rather than evaluating the attack prompts themselves. They introduce two new evaluation frameworks:

1) A coarse-grained evaluation that assigns attack prompts an overall effectiveness score based on whether different LLMs generate prohibited content in response. This provides a broad view of attack impact across models.

2) A fine-grained evaluation that analyzes the specific attack prompt and LLM response in more detail, using similarity metrics to compare the response to expert-curated answers in a purpose-built dataset. This allows more nuanced scoring.

The authors also created a comprehensive dataset covering diverse jailbreaking scenarios to serve as a benchmark for analysis. 

In experiments, the authors showed their evaluation methods align with baseline approaches on overall trends but provide richer insights. They consistently found "Political Lobbying" prompts were most effective across models.

The main contributions are the two evaluation frameworks for precisely analyzing attack prompt effectiveness, and the novel jailbreak dataset that can serve as a resource for future research. More accurate evaluation better equips developers to improve model robustness.

In summary, the paper offers innovative techniques to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of attack prompts aimed at generating harmful content from AI systems. The goal is to provide stronger safeguards against the misuse of rapidly advancing language models.
