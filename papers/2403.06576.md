# [FFAD: A Novel Metric for Assessing Generated Time Series Data Utilizing   Fourier Transform and Auto-encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06576)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of effective metrics to evaluate the quality of generative models for time series data, unlike image data which has Fréchet Inception Distance (FID). This is due to absence of a widely accepted feature vector extractor pre-trained on time series datasets.
- Time series data can vary greatly in length, making it difficult to train models on them. Fourier Transform can be used to convert time series from time domain to frequency domain for standardized representation.

Proposed Solution:
- Use Fourier Transform to convert varying length time series to frequency domain and select a suitable number of frequency components to represent each series. This ensures a consistent input length for training models.
- Train a recurrent autoencoder on various time series datasets to learn robust hidden representations. Use the encoder for feature extraction.
- Define a new metric called Fréchet Fourier-transform Auto-encoder Distance (FFAD) inspired by FID to measure similarity of time series distributions using the autoencoder encodings.

Main Contributions:
- Determine right number of frequency components to balance reconstruction capability and compression.
- Demonstrate effectiveness of autoencoder trained on multiple datasets to learn compressed representations of time series.
- Introduce FFAD score to distinguish between same and different class time series, making it suitable for evaluating conditional generative models.
- Overall, FFAD is shown to be a promising metric for assessing quality and diversity of generatively modeled time series.
