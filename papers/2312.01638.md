# [J-Net: Improved U-Net for Terahertz Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01638)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes J-Net, a novel convolutional neural network architecture for super-resolution of terahertz images. Terahertz imaging suffers from low resolution due to the long wavelength of terahertz waves compared to visible light. The authors introduce an enhanced U-Net architecture called J-Net tailored to learn the mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution terahertz images efficiently. A key contribution is customizing the degradation model during training to simulate real-world impairments in terahertz imaging including blurring, downsampling, and noise with spatial variations. J-Net adds an extra upsampling path compared to U-Net for increased feature map size and uses simple baseline blocks that stabilize training. Experiments conducted on the DIV2K+Flickr2K dataset and real-world terahertz images of a metal knife demonstrate superior peak signal-to-noise ratio and visual quality by J-Net over other methods including bicubic interpolation, Lucy-Richardson deconvolution, as well as other deep learning techniques. The customized architecture and training regime equip J-Net to super-resolve the unique degradation present in terahertz imaging, making it a promising technique to enhance terahertz image resolution for applications spanning security screening to medical imaging.
