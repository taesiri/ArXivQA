# [Fisher information dissipation for time inhomogeneous stochastic   differential equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the convergence analysis and rates for time-dependent stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are widely used for modeling and Bayesian sampling. Specific examples include simulated annealing and Langevin dynamics. A key challenge is analyzing the convergence of the probability density function for the solution of time-inhomogeneous SDEs towards an invariant or target distribution. 

Main Contributions:

1. The paper formulates the Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density as a gradient flow with an extra non-gradient term in the probability density function space. This allows decomposing the dynamics into reversible and non-reversible components.

2. A time-dependent relative Fisher information functional is introduced as a Lyapunov functional to characterize the convergence. Conditions are derived involving the time-dependent Hessian matrix of a modified entropy functional to guarantee Fisher information dissipation.

3. The conditions and convergence rates are analyzed for three examples - overdamped Langevin, irreversible drift Langevin, and underdamped Langevin dynamics. For overdamped dynamics with strongly convex potentials, an O(1/t) convergence rate is shown in KL divergence.

4. For irreversible Langevin dynamics, the convergence rate can be improved near the optima with a specially constructed non-gradient drift term. Conditions for convergence are analyzed for underdamped Langevin dynamics.

5. Several numerical examples demonstrate and verify the convergence analysis for time-inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations and simulated annealing dynamics.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in establishing Hessian matrix conditions for convergence rates of densities for time-dependent and irreversible SDEs based on information theoretic functionals. The analysis and examples provide valuable insights into designing stochastic algorithms for sampling and optimization.
