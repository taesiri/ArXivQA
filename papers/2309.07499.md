# [Efficiently Robustify Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07499)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we efficiently induce robustness to large-scale pretrained models without sacrificing their original properties like clean accuracy, transfer learning capabilities etc.?

The authors highlight that existing techniques like fine-tuning with advanced augmentations or interpolation-based methods can make models robust but are computationally expensive and can cause the models to forget their original knowledge. 

To address this, the authors propose a knowledge transfer approach where robustness is first induced in a small model which then acts as a teacher to transfer robustness to a large pretrained model. The key aspects of their approach are:

- Using a small robust teacher model to distill knowledge, which is efficient. 

- Introducing multiple heads in the large model - a clean head, robust head and combined head. This helps preserve clean accuracy while gaining robustness.

- A novel uncertainty-aware knowledge distillation method to reliably choose between the clean and robust heads at test time.

Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that their approach can efficiently induce robustness in large vision models like CLIP, ViT etc. while maintaining clean accuracy and transfer learning abilities, unlike prior techniques.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that knowledge transfer from a small robust model can be an efficient and effective way to make large pretrained models robust without sacrificing their original strengths. The proposed techniques help achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Benchmarking the robustness performance of large-scale vision models, including both unimodal (image-only) and multimodal (vision+language) models, under different types of synthetic and natural perturbations/distribution shifts. 

- Proposing an efficient knowledge transfer method to induce robustness in large pretrained models without sacrificing their original properties like clean accuracy, transfer learning capabilities etc. The key ideas are:

(i) Using a small robust teacher model to transfer robustness knowledge to the large student model. Making the small model robust is computationally cheaper. 

(ii) Only tuning a small part of the large student model to induce robustness while keeping most of it fixed, to maintain original properties.

(iii) Employing a multi-headed architecture and uncertainty-aware distillation approach to ensure clean accuracy is preserved in one head and robustness induced in another head.

(iv) Selecting the appropriate head at test time via uncertainty estimation and divergence calculation between head predictions.

- Showing through extensive experiments that the proposed method makes large vision models robust to various synthetic and natural perturbations more efficiently than prior techniques like data augmentation or complete fine-tuning, while retaining properties like clean accuracy and transfer learning ability.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be an efficient knowledge transfer framework to make large vision models robust without sacrificing their original capabilities, which is challenging to achieve with existing methods. The multi-headed architecture and uncertainty-guided distillation approach help achieve this.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method to induce robustness in large pre-trained vision models without sacrificing their original properties, by robustifying a small model first and then using it to transfer robust knowledge via uncertainty-aware distillation to tune only a small portion of the large model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on robustifying large vision models:

- Benchmarking robustness: The paper provides a comprehensive benchmarking of different model sizes, architectures, and training modalities (unimodal vs multimodal) on various synthetic and natural distribution shifts. This analysis of model robustness under distribution shift is quite extensive compared to prior work. 

- Efficient robustification: The paper proposes a novel method to efficiently robustify large pretrained models without sacrificing their original performance or properties like transfer learning abilities. This approach is more efficient than prior robust training methods like full fine-tuning or advanced augmentations.

- Knowledge transfer for robustness: Using knowledge transfer from a small robust model to induce robustness in a large model is a novel direction. Most prior knowledge distillation works focus on model compression, so this application to robustness is innovative.

- Uncertainty-aware distillation: The proposed uncertainty-aware knowledge distillation technique using multiple heads and uncertainty modeling is unique. It allows preserving both clean and robust accuracy unlike typical distillation.

- Analysis: The paper provides extensive analysis like pareto fronts relating accuracy and training time, ablation studies, comparison of model architectures/modalities for knowledge transfer. This offers useful insights on model robustness.

Overall, the large-scale robustness analysis, efficient robust training approach via uncertainty-aware knowledge transfer, and detailed empirical analysis are the key novel aspects compared to related work on robustness and knowledge distillation. The proposed method pushes state-of-the-art on making large vision models robust.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Theoretical analysis: The authors mention that a theoretical underpinning of their approach is currently missing. Developing a theoretical analysis of their uncertainty-aware knowledge distillation technique could be an interesting direction for future work.

- Exploration of different robustification methods for the teacher model: The authors suggest exploring other methods like PixMix to further improve the robustness of the teacher model, which can then improve the student model robustness. 

- Analysis across different modalities: The authors demonstrate their method on vision models, but suggest it could be extended to other modalities like text, speech etc. Exploring knowledge transfer across modalities could be worthwhile.

- Scaling to larger models: The authors suggest their method could potentially be scaled to induce robustness in even larger models with billions of parameters. Evaluating the feasibility of this could be impactful.

- Combining with other techniques: The authors suggest their method is orthogonal to several other robustness techniques, so exploring combinations with methods like adversarial training or test-time optimization could prove useful.

- Theoretical justification: Developing theoretical justifications for why their method is effective in transferring robustness from smaller to larger models would strengthen the approach.

So in summary, some key directions are: theoretical analysis, exploring combinations with other techniques, scaling to larger models, evaluating on new modalities, and improving the teacher robustification methods. The authors provide a novel robust knowledge transfer technique and suggest several interesting ways to build on it.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method to induce robustness to large scale pretrained vision models without sacrificing their original properties like clean accuracy and transfer learning capabilities. First, the authors benchmark the performance of recent large models like CLIP under various distribution shifts and find they are still brittle. Then, they propose a knowledge transfer approach where a small robust model is used as a teacher to induce robustness into a large model, which serves as the student. To ensure robustness is learned while preserving original accuracy, the student model is augmented with multiple prediction heads - one for clean data, one for shifted data, and one combined. These heads are selectively used during inference based on uncertainty and divergence estimates. By updating only a small portion of the large model, the method achieves robustness efficiently without losing clean accuracy or transfer capabilities. Experiments validate gains over baselines on ImageNet perturbations and other robustness tasks while retaining properties like zero-shot performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method to make large pre-trained vision models robust to real-world distribution shifts without sacrificing their original capabilities. The authors first benchmark the performance of popular large scale models like ViTs, ResNets and CLIP under various synthetic and natural distribution shifts. They find that while these models achieve good performance on clean datasets, their accuracy significantly degrades under distribution shifts. To address this, the authors propose a knowledge distillation based approach to transfer robustness from a small robust teacher model to the large student model. Specifically, they introduce a multi-headed architecture with separate heads for clean and corrupted examples, and distill knowledge from the small robust model into the corrupted head of the large model. An uncertainty-aware inference procedure is used to select the appropriate head at test time. This approach induces robustness while preserving clean accuracy and transfer learning abilities of the large models. Experiments on ImageNet variations and other datasets demonstrate improved robust accuracy with minimal overhead compared to prior techniques like data augmentation and full fine-tuning.

In summary, the key ideas are:

1) Benchmarking robustness of large scale vision models and finding they are brittle to distribution shifts. 

2) Proposing a knowledge distillation approach with multi-headed architecture and uncertainty-based inference to make these models robust efficiently while retaining their capabilities like clean accuracy and transfer learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient method to make large pre-trained vision models robust to distribution shifts without sacrificing their original representation capabilities. The key idea is to use a small robust model as a teacher to transfer robust knowledge to the large model (student) via a novel multi-headed architecture and uncertainty-aware distillation. Specifically, two additional prediction heads are plugged into the student model - a "clean" head and a "robust" head, along with the original "combined" head. The clean head preserves accuracy on clean data by mimicking the original student weights, while the robust head learns robustness from the small robust teacher model on shifted data. The combined head is trained on both clean and shifted data. During inference, the head for a given sample is selected based on modeling uncertainty of each head's predictions via Monte Carlo dropout, as well as the KL divergence between heads. This allows efficiently inducing robustness in the student while retaining its original capabilities, without expensive fine-tuning.
