# [PANDAS: Prototype-based Novel Class Discovery and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17420)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Object detectors are typically trained on a fixed set of classes. However, in real-world deployment, new object classes inevitably emerge that were not seen during training. This paper tackles the problem of novel class discovery and detection, which requires extending a detector to i) spot the presence of novel classes in unlabeled data, ii) automatically discover those classes, and iii) detect both the original base classes and the newly discovered classes. This is challenging as it requires distinguishing novel classes from background patterns, avoiding catastrophic forgetting of base classes, and adding novel classes automatically without manual intervention.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose PANDAS, a prototype-based novel class discovery and detection method. It has two phases:

1) Base Phase: An off-the-shelf Faster R-CNN detector is trained on labeled data from base classes. Prototypes are computed for each base class by averaging ground truth features.

2) Discovery Phase: The base detector is used to extract features from unlabeled data. These features are clustered using k-means to obtain novel class prototypes.  

During inference, features are extracted for each detected region and compared to both base and novel prototypes using a distance-based classifier. This allows detecting both base and discovered classes.

Main Contributions:
- PANDAS outperforms recent state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC and COCO-to-LVIS benchmarks, while being simpler and faster. For example, it is 36x faster than RNCDL on VOC and 5x faster on COCO-to-LVIS.
- It does not require storing base class images during discovery to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This reduces storage needs.
- It does not need to know the number of novel classes a priori.
- Analysis of different design choices shows the benefits of using a background classifier and ground truth vs learned prototypes.
- Qualitative results demonstrate that PANDAS can sometimes detect novel objects missed by the ground truth annotations.

In summary, PANDAS is a simple, fast and effective approach for novel class discovery and detection that demonstrates strong empirical performance against existing methods. Its simplicity also makes it widely applicable in practice.
