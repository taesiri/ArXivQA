# [BVR Gym: A Reinforcement Learning Environment for Beyond-Visual-Range   Air Combat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17533)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- BVR (beyond visual range) air combat is important in modern warfare but manually creating tactics is time-consuming. Reinforcement learning (RL) could help discover novel maneuvers and tactics.  
- Existing RL environments either lack high-fidelity physics simulation, are not open source, or are not adapted to the BVR domain. There is a need for an open-source, high-fidelity RL environment for exploring BVR air combat.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop an open-source RL environment called BVR Gym based on the JSBSim flight dynamics simulator. 
- The environment includes an F-16 aircraft model and a long-range missile model adapted for BVR combat, with the ability to customize scenarios.
- Three example scenarios are provided:
   1) Evading one missile
   2) Evading two missiles 
   3) One vs one BVR "dogfight" between an F-16 aircraft (controlled by the RL agent) and an adversary F-16 aircraft with a pre-defined behavior tree policy.
- The environment has a simple OpenAI Gym-style interface to facilitate integrating various RL algorithms.  

Main Contributions:
- BVR Gym is an open-source, high-fidelity RL environment for investigating BVR air combat tactics.  
- It provides realistic F-16 aircraft and missile models tailored for BVR combat.
- The modular scenarios and OpenAI Gym interface allow easy integration of RL algorithms. 
- Results demonstrate the ability to train policies for missile evasion and defeating an adversary in BVR combat.
- BVR Gym helps fill the gap between existing high-fidelity simulators and environments adapted to the BVR domain. It enables researchers to explore novel maneuvers and tactics for modern air warfare.

In summary, the paper introduces BVR Gym as a specialized RL environment to research BVR air combat tactics using high-fidelity simulation. The open-source and customizable nature of BVR Gym facilitates experimentation with policies and scenarios in this complex domain.
