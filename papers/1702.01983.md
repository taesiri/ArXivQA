# [Face Aging With Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01983)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform realistic face aging while preserving the original person's identity. Specifically, the authors propose a conditional generative adversarial network (Age-cGAN) approach to synthesize aged and rejuvenated face images, while ensuring the identity is maintained.The key contributions are:1) Designing an Age-cGAN model that can generate high quality synthetic face images within specified age categories. 2) Proposing a novel "Identity-Preserving" optimization approach for reconstructing an input face image using Age-cGAN's latent vectors, with a focus on preserving the identity.The main hypothesis is that their proposed identity-preserving optimization of Age-cGAN's latent vectors will allow synthesized aged and rejuvenated faces to maintain the original identity, while still looking realistic. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis by testing face recognition performance on the reconstructed and aged faces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) approach for face aging that can synthetically age or rejuvenate an input face image while preserving the person's identity. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. The design of an Age Conditional GAN (Age-cGAN) that can generate high quality synthetic face images within specified age categories. 2. A new "Identity-Preserving" latent vector optimization method that allows Age-cGAN to reconstruct an input face image while preserving the original identity. This is done by optimizing the latent vector to minimize the distance between facial identity embeddings rather than pixel-wise differences.3. Demonstrating both subjectively and objectively using facial recognition systems that the proposed identity-preserving optimization generates aged faces that maintain the original identity much better than previous pixel-wise optimization approaches.4. Showing that the optimized Age-cGAN can realistically age faces across different age ranges (e.g. aging a young face to look elderly) while preserving the core identity.In summary, the key novelty is the identity-preserving GAN framework for face aging that can transform facial age while maintaining the person's identity, which has been a challenging problem in previous face aging work. The proposed techniques provide improved solutions for applications like age-invariant face recognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a novel GAN-based method for automatic face aging that emphasizes preserving the original person's identity in the aged version of their face through a new "Identity-Preserving" optimization approach for GAN's latent vectors.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research on face aging using generative adversarial networks (GANs):- It proposes a novel conditional GAN called Age-cGAN that can generate high quality synthetic face images within specified age categories. This allows better control over aging compared to prior work like Larsen et al. that did binary aging.- It introduces a new "Identity-Preserving" latent vector optimization method to reconstruct the input face while preserving the person's identity. This is a key contribution compared to prior GAN aging works that often lost identity.- The proposed aging approach of optimizing the latent vector z and changing the age condition y allows aging while keeping the identity, as demonstrated both visually and through face recognition tests. This is superior to prior works.- Objective evaluations using a state-of-the-art face recognizer and age estimator demonstrate the effectiveness of Age-cGAN for identity-preserving aging. Quantitative comparisons to other methods are lacking but would be useful.- The proposed approach is limited to aging discrete age categories rather than continuous aging, which restricts the granularity. Some recent works have focused on continuous aging.- The use of a pre-trained face recognizer network for optimization is interesting but dependent on that external model. An end-to-end trained approach could be more robust.Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions around conditional image generation and identity-preserving optimization for face aging. The proposed Age-cGAN model outperforms prior GAN-based approaches, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on aging with identity preservation. More comparisons and ablation studies could solidify the improvements over prior arts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Use the face aging method for synthetic augmentation of face datasets and for improving the robustness of face recognition solutions in cross-age scenarios.- Further improve the face reconstruction part of the method by combining "Pixelwise" and "Identity-Preserving" optimization approaches into one unified objective function.- Explore conditional GANs for altering other facial attributes beyond age (e.g. adding beard, sunglasses, etc) while still preserving identity. - Investigate other potential applications of the identity-preserving latent vector optimization approach, since it is universal and not limited to face aging.- Enhance the age conditional GAN model itself, for example by using more age categories, improving disentanglement of age and identity information, generating higher resolution images, etc.In summary, the main future directions are to build on this work to enable both better conditional face image generation and synthesis, as well as improved identity preservation when manipulating facial attributes. There are opportunities to enhance the technical approach, broaden the applications, and scale up the datasets and models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a GAN-based method for face aging that can synthesize realistic face images with a specified target age while preserving the identity of the original face. The key contributions are:1) Age-cGAN, a conditional GAN that generates faces belonging to specific age categories. It disentangles age information (encoded in the condition vector) from other facial attributes like identity, pose, etc. (encoded in the latent vector). 2) An "identity-preserving" latent vector optimization technique to find the latent vector that best reconstructs a given input face while preserving its identity. This allows transformation to a target age category in a way that maintains the original identity. Experiments show this method outperforms a baseline "pixelwise" optimization approach in identity preservation.Overall, this identity-preserving face aging method enables applications like dataset augmentation and improving cross-age face recognition while generating realistic aged faces that retain the person's identity.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method for synthesizing aged and rejuvenated faces using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model called Age-cGAN. The method consists of two main steps. First, the input face image is reconstructed by finding an optimal latent vector approximation that preserves the person's identity. This is done through a novel "identity-preserving" latent vector optimization approach. Second, the face is aged or rejuvenated by simply changing the age condition input to the generator network. The key contributions of the paper are the design of Age-cGAN for generating high quality face images conditioned on age, and the identity-preserving latent vector optimization method. This optimization approach minimizes the distance between face embeddings from the original and reconstructed images to improve identity preservation. Experiments show the proposed method can realistically age and rejuvenate faces while maintaining the original identity much better than previous pixel-wise optimization methods. The face aging method has applications in cross-age face recognition and dataset augmentation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a face aging method based on a conditional generative adversarial network (Age-cGAN). The method has two main steps:1. Reconstruct the input face image by finding an optimal latent vector z* that allows the Age-cGAN generator to produce an image very close to the original input image. A novel "identity-preserving" optimization approach is used to find z* in order to preserve the identity of the person in the reconstructed image. 2. Perform face aging by simply changing the age condition input to the Age-cGAN generator using the optimized z* found in step 1. This allows generating an aged version of the input face while preserving the original identity due to the optimized z* vector.The key contributions are the Age-cGAN model for controlled age-based face image generation and the identity-preserving latent vector optimization approach for face reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate the method's ability to generate faces with target ages while retaining the person's identity.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper addresses the problem of face aging, which involves synthetically altering a face image to look older or younger while preserving the person's identity. The main questions/goals addressed in the paper are:- How to generate synthetic face images that look natural across different age categories using generative adversarial networks (GANs).- How to modify/reconstruct a given face image to a different age in an identity-preserving manner using a conditional GAN model. - Proposing a novel "identity-preserving" latent vector optimization approach to find the optimal latent vector that reconstructs the input face while preserving the person's identity, compared to a "pixelwise" optimization approach.In summary, the key focus is on developing a GAN-based face aging method that can realistically synthesize faces at target ages, while preserving the identity of the original person. The novel contributions are the Age-cGAN model and the proposed identity-preserving latent vector optimization approach.
