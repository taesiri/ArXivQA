# [Robust Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition with Boundary Discrimination   and Correlation Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07961)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores the vulnerability of existing few-shot named entity recognition (NER) models under textual adversarial attacks. The authors construct adversarial examples using synonym substitution to evaluate model robustness. They find that current models exhibit a significant performance drop on unseen entity types when facing these attacks. To address this, the authors propose a robust two-stage few-shot NER method called BDCP. In the span detection stage, an entity boundary discriminative module provides a robust representation space to detect spans. In the entity typing stage, correlation purification is performed between entities and contexts to minimize interference information and facilitate correlation generalization, alleviating perturbations from attacks. Comprehensive experiments on two few-shot NER datasets with adversarial examples demonstrate the superiority and robustness of BDCP. The proposed boundary discrimination and correlation purification are shown to be effective techniques for improving model robustness to textual attacks in few-shot cross-domain NER transfer scenarios.
