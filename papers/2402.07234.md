## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is a lack of specialized benchmarks to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex public security tasks. Existing benchmarks struggle to fully capture the unique challenges and stringent accuracy requirements of public security applications. 

Proposed Solution - CPSDBench:
- The authors construct a specialized Chinese public security domain benchmark called CPSDBench to assess LLM performance. 
- CPSDBench contains real-world datasets across text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation.
- Customized prompt engineering and evaluation metrics are designed to better fit public security tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive LLM evaluation across key public security work dimensions using specialized datasets.  
- Innovative two-stage evaluation metric for information extraction to improve accuracy.
- Analysis of 10 mainstream Chinese LLMs to reveal strengths/limitations on public security data.
- Revealed limitations of existing LLMs on sensitive/adversarial data, guiding future optimize direction.

In summary, the paper introduces CPSDBench to fill the gap in LLM evaluation for the complex and unique public security domain. The benchmark and analysis provide insights to guide the development of customized LLMs better suited for public security needs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces CPSDBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models on Chinese public security tasks across four dimensions: text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Constructing CPSDBench, a specialized evaluation benchmark dataset tailored for the Chinese public security domain. CPSDBench integrates real-world public security related datasets across four key dimensions - text classification, information extraction, question answering, and text generation - to enable a comprehensive assessment of large language models' capabilities in handling public security tasks.

The paper also introduces innovative evaluation metrics designed specifically to quantify the performance of large language models in public security scenarios more precisely. This includes a two-stage evaluation metric for information extraction that calculates both exact match and fuzzy match scores.

Additionally, the paper conducts an in-depth analysis and evaluation of 9 mainstream large language models using CPSDBench. The results provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current models in addressing public security issues, serving as a reference for future development of more accurate and customized models for this field.

In summary, the key contribution is constructing a specialized benchmark to evaluate large language models for Chinese public security tasks, along with optimized evaluation metrics and extensive empirical analysis of mainstream models.
