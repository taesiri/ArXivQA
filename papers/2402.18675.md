# [Robot Body Schema Learning from Full-body Extero/Proprioception Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper aims to enable robots to autonomously learn and represent their own body structure, termed as the "body schema", using only onboard sensory data. Specifically, the body schema refers to the interconnections and joints among different links and end effectors of the robot. Obtaining this knowledge is challenging since the underlying topology of a robot's body is not directly observable, especially in cases where such information is unavailable, e.g. for robots with unknown or evolving configurations.   

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that by analyzing the dependency relationships between variations in IMU (inertial measurement unit) and joint encoder data across the robot's body using a novel heterogeneous dependency matrix, the implicit topology of the robot can be inferred. 

Specifically, this is achieved by:
1) Training a neural network per IMU sensor to estimate its global pose relative to the base frame as a function of the joint angles. 
2) Extracting the Jacobian of these neural networks which encodes dependencies between joint motions and IMU poses.
3) Constructing a heterogeneous dependency matrix by stacking and merging the Jacobian-based dependency features across sensors.
4) Proving the equivalence between the extracted matrix and a heterogeneous out-tree representation of the robot topology.
5) Designing algorithms to translate between the two representations and handle cases like partial observability or sensing noise.

When provided only with proprioceptive and exteroceptive measurements, this approach can successfully recognize the body structures of simulated and real robots across diverse configurations.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the robot body topology learning problem from onboard sensing 
- Introduction of heterogeneous dependency matrix and proof of its equivalence to heterogeneous out-tree body representation
- Neural network and data processing pipeline to extract such body schema representations from raw sensor data
- Algorithms to reconstruct valid body structures under partial/noisy observations
- Experiments demonstrating successful body schema recognition on simulated and physical robots
