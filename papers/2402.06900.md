# [Can LLMs Recognize Toxicity? Structured Toxicity Investigation Framework   and Semantic-Based Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit bias and toxicity, but most existing metrics for evaluating toxicity rely on datasets and classifiers which have limitations around out-of-distribution generalization.
- Upstream bias in LLMs can also negatively impact downstream tasks like self-debiasing.
- It's unclear how suitable LLMs are as toxicity evaluators themselves and what factors influence their evaluation performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a framework to investigate inherent toxicity of LLMs across factors like demeaning content, partiality, and ethical preference. This determines "safe" domains for each LLM.
- Propose LLMs As ToxiciTy Evaluators (LATTE), a robust automatic metric grounded in LLMs themselves to evaluate toxicity.
- LATTE uses the LLMs' zero-shot capabilities so it can adapt to different definitions of toxicity without retraining.
- Analyze the impact of factors like model choice, prompt format, content and scale on LATTE's evaluation performance.  

Main Contributions:
- Toxicity investigation framework and benchmarks to test awareness and neutrality of LLMs across different factors.
- Demonstration that upstream toxicity and bias impacts downstream evaluation performance.  
- Proposed LATTE metric outperforms SOTA baselines by 12 F1 points without any training by leveraging suitable LLMs.
- Analysis of optimal factors and templates for using LLMs as toxicity evaluators.
- Showed applicability of evaluation prompt to other LLMs besides original test cases.

In summary, the paper introduces a methodology to reliably use LLMs as toxicity evaluators based on their capabilities, provides in-depth analysis of the factors that influence evaluation, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a robust metric called LATTE to evaluate the toxicity of language model responses by leveraging the models themselves as evaluators, after qualifying them through a toxicity investigation framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LATTE (LLMs As ToxiciTy Evaluators), a robust automatic metric to detect toxicity in language model outputs. Specifically:

- They define toxicity using three factors: demeaning content, partiality, and ethical preference. 

- They propose a framework to investigate the inherent toxicity in LLMs across those factors to determine which domains are "safe" for the models to evaluate toxicity.

- They develop the LATTE metric that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs to detect toxicity without requiring additional training. LATTE outperforms other toxicity metrics by 12 F1 points.

- They analyze the impact of different prompt formats and contents on LATTE's effectiveness. They find that providing a clear definition of toxicity tailored to the evaluation dataset yields the best results.

- They demonstrate that upstream model toxicity/biases can significantly impact downstream evaluation performance, highlighting the importance of their qualification process.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a superior toxicity evaluation metric using LLMs by first assessing their safety and suitability across different toxicity factors.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Toxicity detection/evaluation
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness
- Toxicity factors (demeaning, partiality, ethical preference)  
- Toxicity investigation framework
- LLMs As ToxiciTy Evaluators (LATTE) metric
- Prompt engineering (format, content, scale, etc.)
- Multilingual capabilities
- Model neutrality 
- Few-shot learning

The paper proposes a toxicity evaluation metric called LATTE that leverages the capabilities of large language models. It first defines different factors of toxicity and investigates whether LLMs exhibit neutrality towards these factors. After qualifying certain models, the LATTE metric is constructed using careful prompt engineering. Experiments demonstrate the robustness and state-of-the-art performance of LATTE in detecting toxicity across different datasets. The analysis also shows the importance of model neutrality and multilingual handling for reliable toxicity evaluation.

In summary, the key focus is on evaluating and ensuring model safety through robust toxicity detection, enabled via a calibrated use of LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a toxicity investigation framework to determine which toxicity factors the LLMs are inherently biased towards and which factors they can evaluate neutrally. What are some ways this framework could be expanded to cover additional toxicity factors beyond the three proposed (demeaning content, partiality, ethical preference)?

2. The paper introduces a metric called LATTE that utilizes the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs to evaluate toxicity without further training. How could this metric be adapted to provide more granular toxicity scores beyond just binary classification? Could a regression approach work?

3. The prompt engineering process for LATTE considers factors like format, content, scale, and language. What other prompt factors could be explored to further optimize LATTE's performance? For example, how might positive and negative exemplars impact results?

4. The paper shows how upstream toxicity biases in LLMs can negatively impact downstream evaluation performance. What mechanisms could be incorporated into LATTE to account for and mitigate these upstream biases? 

5. The paper demonstrates how providing explicit toxicity definitions to LATTE improves evaluation accuracy. However, defining toxicity is complex. What processes could be used to systematically and responsibly construct toxicity definitions for LATTE across different contexts?

6. The paper experiments with multilingual prompts but finds mixed results. What best practices around incorporating non-English languages into prompts could help improve multilingual evaluation? How might translation quality impact results?

7. The paper indicates that LATTE struggles with assessing some ethical preference factors. What modifications could make LATTE better suited for evaluating complex ethical considerations beyond just offensiveness?

8. The paper shows how adding few-shot examples to prompts can improve robustness. What other techniques from prompt-based few-shot learning could be beneficial for LATTE?

9. LATTE is shown to outperform existing toxicity classifiers because it avoids overfitting to specific datasets. However, LLMs have their own inherent biases. How can we safeguard against LATTE simply detecting biases already present in LLMs themselves?

10. The paper demonstrates LATTE for English but mentions it could work for other languages pending sufficient upstream model sizes. What multilingual data and models would be needed to produce reliable toxicity evaluation from LATTE across many languages?
