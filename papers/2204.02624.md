# There Are a Thousand Hamlets in a Thousand People's Eyes: Enhancing   Knowledge-grounded Dialogue with Personal Memory

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1. Can introducing personal memory into knowledge selection enhance knowledge-grounded dialogue by making it more personalized and human-like? 2. Can modeling the relationship between personal memory and knowledge selection via latent variables and dual learning improve knowledge selection in knowledge-grounded conversation?3. Does incorporating personal memory into knowledge selection lead to more informative, engaging, and persona-consistent responses in knowledge-grounded dialogue systems?The central hypothesis appears to be that incorporating personal memory into knowledge selection will improve knowledge selection and allow for more personalized, human-like responses in knowledge-grounded conversation systems. The key ideas are:- Personal memory influences knowledge selection in human conversations, but this aspect is ignored in existing knowledge-grounded dialogue systems.- Modeling the relationship between personal memory and knowledge selection via latent variables $Z^p$ and $Z^k$ can capture this influence.- Using dual learning to train the mappings between $Z^p$ and $Z^k$ in both directions allows the model to learn this relationship. - Incorporating the selected personal memory and knowledge into response generation will produce more personalized and engaging responses.The paper aims to demonstrate these hypotheses through the proposed model and experiments on a new knowledge-grounded dialogue dataset featuring personal memory. The results appear to confirm the hypotheses and show improvements over existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method to introduce personalization into knowledge-grounded dialogue by modeling the relationship between personal memory and knowledge selection. Specifically:- The paper explores personalization in knowledge selection for knowledge-grounded conversation (KGC), which has not been studied before. It proposes using user-specific personalized memory to guide knowledge selection.- It constructs a new KGC dataset featuring user-specific utterance history as personal memory. This provides a testbed for research on personalized KGC.- It proposes a variational method with two latent variables to model the dependence between personal memory and knowledge selection. Dual learning is used to learn the mapping between memory and knowledge in both directions.- Experiments show the proposed method significantly outperforms existing KGC methods and personalized dialogue methods on both automatic metrics and human evaluation. This demonstrates the efficacy of incorporating personal memory into knowledge selection.In summary, the key contribution is enhancing knowledge selection in KGC via personalized memory, enabled by a new dataset and a novel dual learning approach. The results validate the importance of personalization for knowledge selection in dialogue systems.
