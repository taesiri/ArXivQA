# [Semi-Supervised Learning for Anomaly Traffic Detection via Bidirectional   Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Anomaly detection in network traffic is critical for network security. Supervised methods require labeled anomaly data which is difficult to obtain. Hence, semi-supervised methods are preferred which train only on normal data.
- Existing semi-supervised methods have limitations - GANs require large data and can only generate similar data; geometric transformations used in images don't apply to network traffic packets.

Proposed Solution:
- A 3-stage framework for anomaly detection using only normal traffic:
   1) Feature Extractor: Autoencoder pre-trained on normal traffic to extract features.
   2) Bidirectional Flow Module: Normalizes feature vectors to a standard normal distribution.
   3) Classifier: Distinguishes between normal and simulated anomaly samples.
- Key idea is to simulate anomaly samples by manipulating normalized vectors:
   - Normal samples mapped to standard normal distribution
   - Anomalies fall outside this distribution
   - Add noise to normalized vectors to simulate anomalies
   - Generate anomalies using flow module's generation capability

Main Contributions:
- First use of normalizing flows to simulate network traffic anomalies without needing anomaly patterns
- Bidirectional flow module effectively normalizes and generates anomalies
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets
- Efficient computation and small model size for deployment
- Framework is end-to-end trainable and improves anomaly detection through simulated anomalies

In summary, the paper introduces a novel way to synthesize anomaly network traffic by leveraging normalizing flows, without requiring any real anomaly samples or patterns during training. The simulated anomalies help build an effective classifier to detect anomalies. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across evaluation datasets.
