# [Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) require long context to handle critical applications like reading comprehension of long documents. However, existing LLMs have limited context windows (e.g. 4K tokens). 
- Existing solutions like fine-tuning or modifying LLM architectures have downsides like expensive training costs, inferior quality, incompatibility with existing LLMs.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose "Extensible Embedding", which are token embeddings that represent information from an extensible context scope rather than a single token. This allows packing more context into the LLM's limited window.
- An "extensible embedder" model transforms input chunks into output embeddings, which are downsampled to get the final extensible embeddings at a desired compression rate.
- The embedder is trained via a two-stream auto-regression method that enables comprehensive loss calculation and exceptional sample efficiency. 
- Downsampling rate can be flexibly adjusted at inference time to enable ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths.

Main Contributions:
- Extensible embedding provides an effective, low-cost method to incorporate long context into LLMs with limited windows.
- The tailored model architecture enables flexible context extension to arbitrary lengths. 
- Two-stream training achieves superior sample efficiency.
- Seamless compatibility as a "plug-in" module without compromising LLM's original capabilities.
- Evaluations show quality improvement in language modeling and understanding with extended context over 100K tokens. Also demonstrates efficiency and compatibility advantages.

In summary, extensible embedding is highlighted for its effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility and compatibility as a method to multiply LLM's usable context length.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes extensible embeddings, a flexible and efficient method to extend the context length of large language models through compact input representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) Extensible embedding presents a simple but effective method to establish a long context for LLMs based on compact representation of the input. 

2) The tailored model architecture facilitates superior and flexible extension for different context lengths.

3) The sample-efficient two-stream auto-regressive task enables cost-effective training of the model.

4) Comprehensive experiments verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method for extending the context length of LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing extensible embeddings as a novel way to effectively and flexibly extend the context length that LLMs can handle, through compact input representations learned in a sample-efficient manner. This enables superior long-context language modeling and understanding while maintaining efficiency and compatibility with existing LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the extensible embedding method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that the size of the context window constrains the input units rather than the limit of context an LLM can perceive. What is the theoretical basis behind this argument? How does extensible embedding implement this idea in practice?

2. The extensible embedder employs a lightweight architecture. What are the design considerations and trade-offs when determining the size and depth of this embedder model? What impacts will this have on effectiveness, flexibility and efficiency? 

3. The two-stream auto-regression training method is highlighted for its superior sample efficiency. Why is the sample efficiency so critical for learning the extensible embeddings? What aspects of the two-stream design contribute to the high sample efficiency?

4. Down-scaling through strided sampling is proposed as a simple but effective approach. What are the pros and cons compared to other down-scaling methods like pooling? Why does strided sampling provide flexibility for diverse context lengths?

5. Compatibility with fine-tuned LLM derivatives is observed but not expected. What intrinsic properties of the training process account for this transferability? Why does direct application work well without further adaptation?  

6. How does the online versus offline mode impact the memory usage and time efficiency during inference? What are the tradeoffs and deciding factors between the two modes for practical deployment?

7. Ablation studies reveal that embedder size, down-scaling method and dynamic sampling all impact overall performance. What is the relationship between these factors and how can they be jointly optimized in practice?

8. The paper demonstrates extension to over 100k context length. What hardware, optimization and architectural constraints need to be addressed to reach even longer contexts such as 1 million? 

9. Error analysis reveals cases where extensible embedding fails to preserve coherence and completeness of context. What modifications could make the embeddings more robust in these cases?

10. How well would the extensible embeddings transfer cross LLM architectures (e.g. decoder-only vs. encoder-decoder)? What adaptations may be needed for new model designs?
