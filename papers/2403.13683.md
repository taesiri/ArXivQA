# [DVMNet: Computing Relative Pose for Unseen Objects Beyond Hypotheses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of estimating the relative pose (3D rotation) of a previously unseen object between a query image and a reference image. This is challenging because the objects in the test set are different from those seen during training. Prior methods rely on scoring a large set of pose hypotheses, which is computationally expensive. Image matching methods also struggle with large viewpoint differences between the query and reference.  

Method:
The paper proposes a Deep Voxel Matching Network (DVMNet) to estimate the relative pose in an end-to-end, hypothesis-free manner. An autoencoder first lifts the query and reference RGB images to voxelized 3D representations. A deep voxel matching module then computes similarities between all pairs of query and reference voxels. To handle unreliable voxels, a Weighted Closest Voxel (WCV) algorithm is introduced to assign confidence scores to each voxel pair based on predicted 2D masks and 3D objectness maps. The relative pose is obtained by solving a weighted least-squares problem using the aligned voxel pairs and their confidence scores.

Main Contributions:
- A hypothesis-free framework to estimate relative pose of unseen objects in a single forward pass, avoiding expensive scoring of pose hypotheses.
- A deep voxel matching strategy to establish voxel-level correspondences between query and reference views.
- A weighted closest voxel algorithm for robust pose estimation by reducing the influence of noisy voxels.
- State-of-the-art performance on CO3D, LINEMOD and Objaverse datasets, with improved efficiency and accuracy over prior arts.
