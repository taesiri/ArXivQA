# [Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt: Bridging the Gap between Graph   Pre-training and Inductive Fine-tuning From Spectral Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13556)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paradigm of "graph pre-training and fine-tuning" has shown great promise in improving graph neural networks (GNNs) by enabling them to learn general graph knowledge without manual annotations. However, there is an immense gap between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, limiting model performance, especially in the inductive setting where fine-tuning graphs differ significantly from pre-training ones. Existing methods are transductive, requiring the same graphs for pre-training and fine-tuning, or require access to pre-training data which is often unavailable. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel graph prompt-based method called Inductive Graph Alignment Prompt (IGAP) to bridge the gap for inductive fine-tuning. 

The key ideas are:
1) Analyze graph pre-training using spectral graph theory to show it aligns graph signals more with low-frequency components capturing essential patterns.
2) Identify two gaps causing issues in inductive setting: graph signal gap and graph structure (spectral space) gap. 
3) Introduce learnable prompts to compensate signal gap and align spectral spaces using low-frequency components, without needing access to pre-training data.
4) Use label prompt to reformulate fine-tuning task into pre-training paradigm.

Contributions:
- Provide theoretical analysis of graph pre-training using spectral graph theory.
- Identify two key gaps limiting inductive fine-tuning.  
- Propose innovative graph prompt solution to compensate signal gap and align spectral space recessively focusing only on low-frequency components essential for transfer.
- Extensive experiments validate effectiveness for node and graph classification under transductive, semi-inductive and inductive settings.

The proposed IGAP framework successfully bridges the gap enabling high-quality inductive fine-tuning without needing access to pre-training data. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate clear improvements.
