# [DGL: Dynamic Global-Local Prompt Tuning for Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10588)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Text-video retrieval is an important multimodal task where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant video for a given text query. Fully finetuning large pretrained models like CLIP on this downstream task is expensive due to the increasing model size. Prompt tuning has emerged as a more efficient alternative but existing methods have two main limitations: (1) They fail to ensure alignment between the text and visual encoders, (2) They are unable to effectively model videos and extract useful temporal information. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a dynamic global-local prompt tuning framework called DGL that addresses the above limitations. The key ideas are:

(1) Generate local-level prompts for both text (word prompts) and vision (frame prompts) from a shared latent space to encourage cross-modal interaction and alignment. Two variants are explored - using a transformer or simple linear layers.

(2) Introduce global-local video attention via global and local prompts to enable modeling videos at both global and local levels. The global prompt captures inter-frame dynamics while local frame prompts focus on each frame.

Main Contributions:

- A cross-modal prompt tuning strategy that generates aligned text and visual prompts from a shared space to maximize interaction.

- A global-local video attention mechanism using hierarchical prompts to comprehensively model video information.

- State-of-the-art or comparable retrieval performance to fully finetuned models on 4 datasets while only tuning 0.67% of the parameters.

In summary, the key novelty of DGL lies in effectively combining ideas from prompt tuning and self-attention to enable efficient yet expressive tuning of large pretrained models for text-video retrieval. The global-local video modeling specifically counteracts limitations of using pretrained image-text models like CLIP for video understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a dynamic global-local prompt tuning method called DGL that generates aligned cross-modal prompts for text and videos from a shared latent space and introduces a global-local attention mechanism to model videos at both the local frame level and global video level for improved text-video retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes DGL, a cross-modal dynamic prompt tuning method with global-local video attention for text-video retrieval. 

2. It generates local-level prompts for text and vision branches from a shared latent space to enhance cross-modal interaction.

3. It proposes a new attention mechanism to create local and global prompts tailored for videos to capture both local frame information and global video information. 

4. Extensive experiments show that compared to fully fine-tuning methods or naive parameter-efficient learning methods, DGL achieves superior or comparable performance on four text-video retrieval datasets while only tuning 0.83M parameters.

So in summary, the key innovations are the cross-modal dynamic prompt tuning strategy and the global-local video attention mechanism that allows capturing both local and global video information effectively and efficiently.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Text-video retrieval - The main task that this paper focuses on. Retrieving the most relevant videos for a given text query.

- Parameter-efficient learning (PEFL) - The paper introduces prompt tuning, a form of PEFL, to text-video retrieval to reduce the parameter cost of adapting large pretrained models like CLIP.

- Cross-modal prompt tuning - The paper proposes joint optimization of visual and text prompts from a shared latent space to ensure cross-modal alignment. 

- Dynamic global-local prompt tuning (DGL) - The main method proposed in the paper. DGL generates dynamic local prompts in both modalities and models videos with global-local attention to capture inter-frame relationships.

- Global-local video attention - A video encoding mechanism proposed that uses global prompts and local frame prompts to perceive both high-level video information as well as fine-grained frame details.

- MSR-VTT, VATEX, LSMDC, ActivityNet - Public video-text retrieval benchmarks used for evaluation.

So in summary, the key focus is introducing efficient prompt tuning strategies for adapting CLIP to video-text retrieval tasks, using techniques like cross-modal prompt generation and multi-granularity video modeling.
