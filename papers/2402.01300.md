# [Two Approaches to Diachronic Normalization of Polish Texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the task of diachronic normalization of Polish texts - converting historical spellings and formatting to contemporary standards to facilitate search and analysis. 

- Diachronic normalization is challenging due to lack of training data, low density of changes needed, and evaluation metrics that reward trivial copying. Prior work has found rule-based approaches can outperform ML, but neural approaches may have potential.

Proposed Solutions:
- The paper presents two approaches: (1) a rule-based solution called "Transducers" that uses handcrafted normalization rules encoded as Java regular expressions and dictionaries, taking a conservative approach focused on high-precision rules; (2) Neural sequence-to-sequence models based on the T5 text-to-text transformer architecture, finetuned on a dataset extracted from novels.

Data:
- The data consists of 248K aligned paragraphs from 87 matched novel editions sourced from Wikisource (historical) and Wolne Lektury (contemporary), preprocesses and aligned. Four dataset variants are created with different pruning and train/test separation strategies.

Experiments & Results:  
- Experiments compare the rule-based Transducers system against the neural T5 models on the four dataset variants using character and word error rates.
- The rule-based system outperforms neural models on three of four variants, but the neural model surpasses it given a fully separated test set with pruning.

Analysis:
- Qualitative analysis shows the neural model handles irregular cases well due to flexibility and context, while rule-based system reliably transforms regular phenomena.

Conclusions & Future Work:
- The rule-based approach is highly effective but the neural approach shows promise. The authors aim to explore hybrid solutions and improve the neural approach to surpass the rule-based performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares two approaches to diachronic normalization of Polish texts: a rule-based solution using handcrafted patterns, and a neural text-to-text model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper discusses and compares two approaches to the diachronic normalization of Polish texts: (1) a rule-based solution relying on handcrafted normalization rules, and (2) neural normalization models based on the T5 text-to-text transfer transformer architecture. The key contribution is an empirical evaluation and analysis comparing these two approaches on variants of a prepared dataset of historical and contemporized Polish texts. The results show that the rule-based solution outperforms the neural approach on 3 out of 4 dataset variants, although the neural approach has advantages in flexibility and irregular pattern recognition. The paper also discusses the preparation of the dataset in detail. Overall, the main contribution is an empirical analysis and comparison of rule-based and neural approaches to diachronic text normalization for Polish.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on a review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Diachronic normalization - The main focus of the paper is on methods for diachronic normalization of texts, which involves transforming historical spelling and punctuation to contemporary standards.

- Polish language - The proposed normalization methods are designed specifically for Polish texts.

- Rule-based methods - One of the approaches explored is a handcrafted, rule-based solution for normalization relying on regular expressions and transformation dictionaries. 

- Neural methods - The other main approach is a neural sequence-to-sequence model based on the T5 architecture finetuned on a parallel corpus.

- Evaluation - Different variants of the prepared Polish dataset are used to train models and quantitatively evaluate the normalization approaches using metrics like character error rate and word error rate.

- Analysis - Qualitative analysis comparing the context flexibility of neural models vs the strict rule application of the rule-based solution.

- Future work - The paper mentions plans to explore hybrid methods combining the rule-based and neural approaches.

In summary, the key terms cover the diachronic normalization task, the language and models used, the evaluation methodology, comparative analysis, and directions for future research.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses both rule-based and neural network approaches to diachronic normalization. What are some of the key differences and relative advantages/disadvantages between these two approaches?

2. The rule-based approach uses handcrafted rules defined with regular expressions. What are some examples of these rules and what types of spelling changes do they aim to address? How were these rules developed?

3. What preprocessing steps were applied to the texts before creating the training and evaluation datasets? Why were these steps necessary?

4. Four variants of the dataset were created based on two criteria - pruning and separation of novels. Explain what these criteria mean and why exploring them leads to more robust evaluation.

5. The neural models are based on the T5 architecture. Why was this architecture selected over other sequence-to-sequence models? What modifications, if any, were made for this task?

6. Training details such as optimizer, learning rate scheduler, batch size etc. are provided. Analyze these choices - are they optimal and how could they be improved? 

7. Both character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER) metrics are reported. What are the relative merits of each for evaluating this task? Which one is more informative and why?

8. The rule-based approach outperformed neural models on 3 out of 4 dataset variants. Analyze and discuss the possible reasons behind this result.

9. The discussion section provides a qualitative analysis of errors made by each approach. Summarize the key differences in both successes and failures between the two approaches.

10. The conclusion mentions some future research directions, including testing hybrid approaches. Elaborate on what a hybrid normalization system might look like and how it could combine strengths of both existing approaches.
