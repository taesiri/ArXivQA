# [MODA: Mapping-Once Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Dual Attentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10008)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we generate high-fidelity and multimodal talking portrait videos from audio in a unified framework?The key points are:- Previous methods for audio-driven portrait animation often focus on lip sync but ignore other movements like head pose. This leads to unnatural results. - The paper proposes a unified framework called MODA to generate multiple motion representations for talking portraits, including lip sync, head pose, eye blinking, and torso motion.- MODA uses a novel dual attention module to handle both deterministic mappings (e.g. accurate lip sync) and probabilistic sampling (e.g. natural head movements).- The proposed method contains a facial composer network and temporally guided renderer to add details and achieve high visual quality.- Experiments demonstrate their method generates more natural, diverse and high-fidelity talking portrait videos compared to prior works.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by jointly modeling lip sync and other portrait motions in a unified framework with dual attentions, they can achieve more realistic audio-driven talking portrait videos. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:- They propose a unified system MODA (Mapping-Once network with Dual Attentions) for generating multimodal talking portrait videos from audio.- They propose a dual attention module in MODA to learn both accurate lip sync from audio as well as diverse modalities like head pose and eye blinking. - They design a facial composer network (FaCoNet) to refine the facial landmarks with details. - They propose a temporally guided renderer with positional encoding to generate high quality and stabilized portrait videos.- Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on talking portrait generation. It can generate videos with accurate lip sync, natural head movements, high image quality and temporal stability.- Their unified framework simplifies the pipeline and can generalize to new subjects without retraining. This makes the system easy to deploy.In summary, the key contribution is a complete system with several novel components for high fidelity and multimodal talking portrait video generation from just audio input. The dual attention mechanism and temporally guided rendering are important technical innovations proposed in this work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a three-stage system called MODA for generating realistic and expressive talking portrait videos from audio, using a unified mapping network with dual attention to produce diverse motion representations, a facial composer network to add detail, and a temporally guided renderer for high quality and stable results.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in audio-driven facial animation:- This paper proposes an end-to-end system for generating realistic talking portrait videos from audio. Many prior works focus only on generating lip sync or lower-quality results. This paper aims to generate high-fidelity and expressive full talking portrait videos.- The proposed MODA network is a unified model to generate diverse facial representations including lip, head pose, eye blinking etc. in one forward pass. Many previous works train separate models for different facial components. MODA simplifies the pipeline. - The dual attention mechanism in MODA enables generating both accurate lip sync driven by audio, as well as probabilistic diverse motions like blinking for naturalness. This helps overcome limitations of prior works that often ignore diversity.- The Facial Composer Network refines and adds details to facial landmarks for high-quality results. Many previous works use sparse landmarks leading to loss of details.- The temporally guided renderer with a U-Net architecture generates high-fidelity and temporally coherent results. Many prior image-based renderers can have temporal inconsistency artifacts.- Overall, the proposed end-to-end pipeline aims to address key limitations in prior arts to generate more realistic, high-quality, diverse and temporally coherent talking portrait videos from just audio input in a simplified model.- Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to recent audio-driven facial animation methods. The user study also shows preference for this method.In summary, the key novelty of this paper is the end-to-end pipeline designed to achieve realistic and high-fidelity talking portrait animation by addressing limitations of prior works through unified mapping, dual attentions, facial composing and temporal rendering. The strong results validate the effectiveness of the approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving the generalization ability of the model to unseen subjects or extremely out-of-domain audio. The authors note the current method does not generalize very well in these scenarios, so developing techniques to improve generalization is an area for future work.- Finding a person-invariant renderer that can achieve high-quality synthesis without requiring additional fine-tuning for new avatars. The authors suggest developing a renderer that is more robust to new subjects.- Exploring ways to disentangle different aspects of motion like head movements and facial expressions. The paper generates these together through the dual attention mechanism, but disentangling them could allow finer control.- Developing an end-to-end model rather than the current multi-stage approach. The authors use separate modules for audio to features, composing landmarks, and rendering. An end-to-end approach could be more elegant.- Improving diversity of generated motions beyond just head and eye movements. Adding things like more body movements could increase realism.- Reducing artifacts around shoulder/neck regions. The authors note some baseline methods have blurring in these regions, so reducing artifacts is an area for improvement.- Increasing inference speed further, as real-time generation remains challenging. So in summary, the main directions are improving generalization, developing a unified renderer, disentangling controls, end-to-end modeling, increasing diversity, reducing artifacts, and improving inference speed. The authors lay out a number of ways their current method could be extended in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a unified system for generating talking portrait videos from audio. The system consists of three stages - 1) A Mapping-Once Network with Dual Attentions (MODA) that generates multimodal and accurate semantic representations like mouth movements, head pose, eye blinking etc from the audio and subject image. MODA uses a novel dual attention module with specific and probabilistic branches to capture deterministic and diverse motions. 2) A Facial Composer Network that combines the outputs from MODA and generates detailed facial landmarks. 3) A temporally guided portrait renderer that generates high quality and temporally stable videos from the landmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets and metrics. The proposed method is more efficient, requiring only one-time training for new subjects compared to re-training other methods. Ablation studies validate the different components of the system. Overall, the paper presents a complete system for generating realistic, diverse and synchronized talking portrait videos.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes MODA, a unified framework for mapping an input audio signal and subject condition to generate a synchronized and diverse talking portrait animation. The approach consists of three main stages - 1) The Mapping-Once network with Dual Attentions (MODA) generates multimodal portrait representations including mouth movements, head pose, eye blinking, and torso from the audio and subject condition in a single forward pass. A novel dual attention module is designed to generate temporally aligned features for accurate lip-sync as well as diverse features for natural head movements and blinking. 2) The Facial Composer Network (FaCo-Net) takes the facial components from MODA and adds details to output dense facial landmarks. 3) Finally, a Temporally Guided Renderer uses the landmarks and a reference image to synthesize high-quality and temporally stable portrait videos.Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the method in terms of both quantitative metrics like mouth landmark distance, velocity, and synchronization as well as qualitative results based on user studies. The unified mapping and dual attention allow generating realistic talking portraits with accurate lip-sync as well as naturally diverse motions. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the different components. Overall, the proposed MODA system provides an effective framework for generating high-fidelity, synchronized, and multimodal talking portrait videos from audio.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes MODA, a mapping-once network with dual attentions for multimodal and high-fidelity portrait video animation from audio. MODA contains a dual-attention module that learns both specific mapping between audio and lip movements, as well as probabilistic mapping between audio and other portrait motions like head pose and eye blinking. This allows generating results with accurate lip-sync as well as natural and diverse motions. MODA outputs mouth, eyes, head pose, and torso representations in a single forward pass. These are fed into a facial composer network to generate detailed facial landmarks. Finally, a temporally guided renderer synthesizes high-fidelity and stabilized talking portrait videos. The proposed system can generate vivid results for multiple subjects from arbitrary audio with a unified framework.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the paper are:- It addresses the problem of generating realistic and expressive talking portrait videos from audio. Previous methods have limitations in generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent, and diverse talking portraits. - The main question it tries to tackle is how to produce natural and high-quality talking portrait videos that have accurate lip synchronization as well as vivid head movements, facial expressions, and upper body motions.Specifically, the paper identifies three key challenges in talking portrait generation:1) Correctness - The synthesized video should have accurate lip sync with the input audio. 2) Visual Quality - The video should be high-resolution with fine details.3) Diversity - Besides lip sync, other motions like head movement should also be natural and diverse over time.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a talking portrait system with three main components:1) A mapping-once network with dual attentions (MODA) to generate multimodal and accurate representations from audio.2) A facial composer network to produce detailed facial landmarks. 3) A temporally guided renderer to synthesize high-fidelity and temporally smooth videos.In summary, the key focus is on generating realistic, high-quality, and expressive talking portrait videos, with an emphasis on proper lip sync, natural diversity of motions, and temporal smoothness. The proposed method aims to overcome limitations of prior arts in achieving these goals.
