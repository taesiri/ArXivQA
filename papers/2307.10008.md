# [MODA: Mapping-Once Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Dual Attentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10008)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we generate high-fidelity and multimodal talking portrait videos from audio in a unified framework?The key points are:- Previous methods for audio-driven portrait animation often focus on lip sync but ignore other movements like head pose. This leads to unnatural results. - The paper proposes a unified framework called MODA to generate multiple motion representations for talking portraits, including lip sync, head pose, eye blinking, and torso motion.- MODA uses a novel dual attention module to handle both deterministic mappings (e.g. accurate lip sync) and probabilistic sampling (e.g. natural head movements).- The proposed method contains a facial composer network and temporally guided renderer to add details and achieve high visual quality.- Experiments demonstrate their method generates more natural, diverse and high-fidelity talking portrait videos compared to prior works.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by jointly modeling lip sync and other portrait motions in a unified framework with dual attentions, they can achieve more realistic audio-driven talking portrait videos. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- They propose a unified system MODA (Mapping-Once network with Dual Attentions) for generating multimodal talking portrait videos from audio.- They propose a dual attention module in MODA to learn both accurate lip sync from audio as well as diverse modalities like head pose and eye blinking. - They design a facial composer network (FaCoNet) to refine the facial landmarks with details. - They propose a temporally guided renderer with positional encoding to generate high quality and stabilized portrait videos.- Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on talking portrait generation. It can generate videos with accurate lip sync, natural head movements, high image quality and temporal stability.- Their unified framework simplifies the pipeline and can generalize to new subjects without retraining. This makes the system easy to deploy.In summary, the key contribution is a complete system with several novel components for high fidelity and multimodal talking portrait video generation from just audio input. The dual attention mechanism and temporally guided rendering are important technical innovations proposed in this work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a three-stage system called MODA for generating realistic and expressive talking portrait videos from audio, using a unified mapping network with dual attention to produce diverse motion representations, a facial composer network to add detail, and a temporally guided renderer for high quality and stable results.
