# [Improving Topic Relevance Model by Mix-structured Summarization and   LLM-based Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Topic relevance models in social search face two key challenges: 
  1) Long documents contain much redundant information unrelated to the query. 
  2) Lack of reliable training data, especially for multi-class relevance models.

Proposed Solutions:

1. Mix-structured Summarization
   - Extract a query-focused summary from the document containing information relevant to the query
   - Extract a general document summary without considering the query, covering key points
   - Connect the two summaries to provide a mix of query-relevant and overall document information
   - Helps the model distinguish degrees of relevance better than using query-focused summaries alone
   
2. LLM-based Data Augmentation
   - Use capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation
   - Query Rewriting: Generate synonyms and antonyms of queries as new queries
   - Query Generation: Extract keywords from documents as new queries
   - Creates more diversity in training data and helps improve model generalization

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrated improving document input with mix-structured summarization enhances model accuracy in distinguishing strong vs weak relevance
- Showed feasibility of using LLMs to augment and diversify training data for relevance models
- Improved performance of relevance scoring in social search scenarios through offline experiments and online A/B testing

The solutions are easy to implement and provide clear benefits for long document relevance tasks in real-world social search systems.
