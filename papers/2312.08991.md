# [A Sim-to-Real Deep Learning-based Framework for Autonomous Nano-drone   Racing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08991)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper describes the deep learning-based navigation system that won first place at the IMAV 2022 Nanocopter AI Challenge drone competition. The authors developed a fully onboard system for a 10cm nano-drone with severe constraints on size, weight, power, and compute resources. Their approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for obstacle avoidance trained purely in simulation, aggressive data augmentation and other sim-to-real techniques to address the reality gap, and a waypoint-based navigation policy tailored for the competition parameters. In their best run, the nano-drone flew for the full 5 minutes at 1.5m/s while avoiding dynamic obstacles, scoring 115 meters traveled without any crashes. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their design rationale, dataset generation process, state estimation characterization, and extensive in-simulation and real-world evaluations of alternative approaches. They significantly advance the state-of-the-art for aggressive autonomous nano-drone flight and provide a solid foundation to progress visual navigation for extremely constrained platforms.
