# [Measuring Vision-Language STEM Skills of Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision-language benchmarks often focus on only one STEM subject area and do not comprehensively evaluate models across science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills. 
- Many datasets aim to test expert-level skills, while fundamental STEM understanding is still lacking in models.
- There is a need for a large-scale, multimodal benchmark to systematically evaluate vision-language models on diverse, real-world STEM skills.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new STEM benchmark called \dataset\ with over 1 million questions spanning 448 skills across science, technology, engineering and math.
- The dataset is designed based on the K-12 curriculum to focus on fundamental skills. Questions are multimodal, containing text and diagrams/images.
- State-of-the-art models like CLIP and GPT-3.5 Turbo are evaluated on the benchmark in a zero-shot setting. Even with recent advances, models still underperform average elementary school students.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of \dataset, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal STEM benchmark with vision-language questions based on K-12 skills.
- Analysis of state-of-the-art model performance, showing AI still has very limited capabilities on elementary STEM compared to humans. 
- The benchmark and analysis provide the community with a challenging testbed to make progress on real-world, multimodal understanding across diverse STEM areas.

In summary, the paper introduces an impactful new STEM benchmark highlighting major gaps between AI and human intelligence for elementary scientific reasoning, using a meticulously constructed multimodal dataset based on the K-12 curriculum.
