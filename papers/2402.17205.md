# [Measuring Vision-Language STEM Skills of Neural Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vision-language benchmarks often focus on only one STEM subject area and do not comprehensively evaluate models across science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills. 
- Many datasets aim to test expert-level skills, while fundamental STEM understanding is still lacking in models.
- There is a need for a large-scale, multimodal benchmark to systematically evaluate vision-language models on diverse, real-world STEM skills.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new STEM benchmark called \dataset\ with over 1 million questions spanning 448 skills across science, technology, engineering and math.
- The dataset is designed based on the K-12 curriculum to focus on fundamental skills. Questions are multimodal, containing text and diagrams/images.
- State-of-the-art models like CLIP and GPT-3.5 Turbo are evaluated on the benchmark in a zero-shot setting. Even with recent advances, models still underperform average elementary school students.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of \dataset, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal STEM benchmark with vision-language questions based on K-12 skills.
- Analysis of state-of-the-art model performance, showing AI still has very limited capabilities on elementary STEM compared to humans. 
- The benchmark and analysis provide the community with a challenging testbed to make progress on real-world, multimodal understanding across diverse STEM areas.

In summary, the paper introduces an impactful new STEM benchmark highlighting major gaps between AI and human intelligence for elementary scientific reasoning, using a meticulously constructed multimodal dataset based on the K-12 curriculum.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new large-scale multimodal benchmark called STEM-Visual to evaluate the science, technology, engineering, and math problem-solving abilities of AI models, finding that while recent models like CLIP and GPT-3.5 Turbo improve over previous methods, their scores are still far below (averaging 54.7% lower) that of average elementary school students, indicating significant room for algorithmic advancement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

(i) It creates a new dataset called STEM-VIZ to benchmark the STEM skills of neural models. STEM-VIZ is the largest multimodal STEM dataset, containing over 1 million questions spanning 448 skills across science, technology, engineering, and math.

(ii) It benchmarks a variety of neural models, including foundation models like CLIP and GPT-3.5 Turbo, on the STEM-VIZ dataset. The results show current models are still far below human performance. 

(iii) It provides analysis to understand model capabilities and limitations at different granularities like subject, skill, and grade level. The paper also explores model scaling and finetuning.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel benchmark to test multimodal STEM skills of AI systems, evaluates state-of-the-art models, and provides insights to guide future research towards developing stronger AI problem solving abilities. The goal is to motivate innovations for real-world STEM challenges.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new STEM dataset called STEM-UP. What are some key differences in the design of STEM-UP compared to existing STEM datasets like VQA and CLEVR? For example, how does the skill coverage and question difficulty compare?

2. The paper evaluates foundation models like CLIP and GPT-3.5 Turbo on STEM-UP. What are some strengths and weaknesses in the approaches taken by these models? For instance, does the vision module in CLIP provide an advantage over pure language models?  

3. The paper shows there is still a large performance gap between neural models and average elementary school students on STEM-UP. What kinds of reasoning skills are models still lacking to perform at the level of students? For example, what challenges remain in mathematical or spatial reasoning?

4. The paper concludes that new algorithmic innovations are necessary for models to master STEM skills. What kinds of innovations could help? For instance, how could incorporating more structured representations or employing hybrid reasoning systems improve performance?

5. The STEM-UP dataset is collected from IXL Learning questions designed for K-12 curriculum. How well do you think the dataset captures the full range and complexity of real-world STEM problems? What other data sources could complement the skills coverage?

6. The paper uses exam scores and accuracies for human evaluation. What other evaluation metrics could provide more insight into model competencies? For example, could open-ended question formats reveal more about reasoning gaps?

7. Model performance shows marginal improvements from scaling up model size alone. What other training methodology innovations could improve model mastery of STEM skills? For instance, how could curriculum learning help?

8. The paper analyzes model performance across subjects, skills, and grade levels. What other analyses could reveal useful insights? For example, how do common student misconceptions compare to model errors? 

9. The paper establishes baseline results with standard pre-trained models. How much room for improvement is there by using more customized model architectures or pretraining procedures tailored for STEM domains?

10. The paper focuses on a multiple choice question format. How challenging would it be to extend the skill evaluation to free-response questions requiring models to provide open-ended explanations?
