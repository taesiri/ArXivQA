# [HumanEval on Latest GPT Models -- 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and the impact of prompt engineering is crucial as we aim to leverage their potential for automating programming tasks. However, there is limited research evaluating GPT-4's performance on code generation and the effect of prompt engineering techniques.

Proposed Solution and Methodology:
- The paper proposes evaluating GPT-4 on the Python coding problems from the HumanEval benchmark to test its code generation abilities. Both pass@1 and pass@10 metrics are used.
- The impact of different prompt engineering strategies like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and reasoning via planning is also analyzed regarding enhancing GPT-4's performance. 
- The goal is to compare GPT-4 with previous LLMs and determine if future models can demonstrate advanced AI abilities without prompt engineering.

Key Contributions:
- Provides a comparison of GPT-4 with predecessors like Codex, CodeGen, GPT-3, and earlier versions of GPT-4 in code generation using HumanEval.
- Evaluates different prompt engineering techniques and their utility in improving GPT-4's code generation skills.
- Discusses the potential for future LLMs to exhibit human-like coding abilities and reduce the need for prompt engineering through innate learning over time.
- Releases open-source code and dataset to enable further research on prompt engineering strategies and LLM evaluations for code generation.

The paper delivers valuable insights into GPT-4's capabilities and the role of prompt engineering, facilitating the integration of LLMs into software development processes.
