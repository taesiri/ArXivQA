# [conv_einsum: A Framework for Representation and Fast Evaluation of   Multilinear Operations in Convolutional Tensorial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03384)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art results on many vision tasks but have huge numbers of parameters. Tensorial neural networks (TNNs) can compress CNNs without much loss in accuracy by reshaping weights into higher order tensors and decomposing them. 

- However, TNN layers involve expensive multilinear operations (MLOs) during training. The evaluation order of these MLOs greatly impacts computation time and memory usage. Existing MLO libraries like numpy's einsum cannot handle convolutions, the key operation in CNNs.

- Thus there is a need for a framework to represent and efficiently evaluate sequences of MLOs with convolutions during TNN training to improve speed and reduce memory overhead.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper develops \conveinsum, an einsum-like notation and meta-algorithm to express and optimally evaluate convolutional tensor networks.

- It allows compact representation of tensorial CNN layers as generalized einsum strings containing convolutions. 

- The \conveinsum meta-algorithm can evaluate these strings by minimizing floating point operations using an optimal sequencer algorithm extended from prior work.

- It also utilizes gradient checkpointing to reduce memory overhead during backpropagation.

Main Contributions:
- A notation and algorithm for optimal evaluation order of multilinear operations with convolutions in tensorial CNNs.

- Theorems showing significant FLOPs reduction is possible over naive evaluation order for common TNN layers.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating faster training and reduced memory usage across tasks and architectures by using \conveinsum. 

- An open-source Python library implementing \conveinsum for training a variety of tensorized ResNets.

In summary, the paper addresses a key bottleneck in training compact TNN-based CNN models by developing a framework to represent and efficiently execute their expensive multilinear operations involving convolutions. Both theorems and experiments validate the acceleration and memory savings possible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a framework called conv_einsum for efficient representation and evaluation of multilinear operations, including convolutions, in tensorial neural networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a framework called "conv_einsum" for efficient representation and evaluation of multilinear operations, including convolutions, in convolutional tensorial neural networks (TNNs). Specifically:

1) They propose a generalized einsum notation that can express multilinear operations with convolutions, as well as a meta-algorithm called "conv_einsum" that can evaluate these operations efficiently. 

2) They develop an optimal sequencer algorithm that can determine the optimal evaluation order to minimize floating point operations (FLOPs) for tensor networks with convolutions.

3) They provide theory and experiments demonstrating that using conv_einsum for evaluating TNNs can significantly improve computational and memory efficiency compared to naive left-to-right evaluation.

4) They release an open-source library implementation for training tensorized ResNets using conv_einsum under different compression rates and tensor decompositions.

In summary, the key innovation is extending einsum to support convolutions and using it to optimize evaluation of tensorial neural networks, providing both algorithmic contributions as well as empirical evidence of efficiency gains. The release of the open-source library also makes this optimization more accessible.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Tensorial neural networks (TNNs)
- Multilinear operations (MLOs) 
- Tensor decompositions (e.g. CP, Tucker, TT)
- Convolutional layers
- Einsum notation

- Optimal evaluation order
- Conveinsum (proposed generalization of einsum to support convolutions)

The main focus of the paper seems to be introducing a framework ("conveinsum") for efficiently evaluating multilinear operations with convolutions in tensorial neural networks. This involves developing algorithms to determine optimal evaluation order to minimize FLOPs. Key ideas include representing TNN computations in a generalized einsum notation, extending the netcon algorithm to support convolutions, and using gradient checkpointing to reduce memory overhead. The experiments demonstrate improved efficiency of convolutional TNN training using conveinsum over standard Pytorch implementations.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new framework called \conveinsum for representing and efficiently evaluating multilinear operations through convolutional tensor layers. Can you provide more details on the key innovations in this framework compared to prior work? How does it generalize/extend existing methods?

2. The paper discusses converting a \conveinsum computation with two inputs to a collection of atomic PyTorch operations. Can you explain this conversion process in more detail? What are some of the key operations it reduces to and why? 

3. When handling a \conveinsum function with an arbitrary number of inputs, the paper utilizes an optimal sequencer to decompose it into a minimal sequence. How does this sequencer work? What algorithm does it leverage and how was it extended to support convolutions?

4. The paper proves two theorems (Theorem 1 and 2) which assert cheaper evaluation paths exist for certain tensor network architectures. Can you summarize what these theorems state and how they are proven? What assumptions are made?

5. For managing memory overhead during backpropagation, the method utilizes gradient checkpointing. Can you explain how this technique works and why it is beneficial? How was it incorporated into the framework?

6. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency using \conveinsum versus naive implementations. Can you analyze these results in more depth - what trends can be observed? How do the gains vary across different tasks, models, and metrics?

7. The paper focuses on computational and memory efficiency improvements from optimized evaluation order. How well does the accuracy of models trained with \conveinsum compare? What factors impact accuracy in this context?

8. The method is evaluated on a diverse set of models (ResNet, Conformer, two-stream networks) and tasks. What modifications were required to handle these different architectures in the framework?

9. The paper claims the approach can work with both PyTorch and TensorFlow. Why is this the case? How are computations mapped to the underlying CUDA libraries?

10. The work is focused on convolutional tensor layers, but mentions handling other layer types like fully-connected layers. What is required to extend the optimizations more broadly across layer types? What challenges exist?
