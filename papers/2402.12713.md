# [Are Large Language Models Rational Investors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12713)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly used for financial analysis, but their reliability is challenged by inherent biases like risk preference bias which can skew market interpretations.  
- There is a need to thoroughly evaluate the "financial rationality" of LLMs before deploying them for finance applications.
- Existing methodologies for bias detection have limitations - they lack grounding in behavioral finance theory or focus only on data checks rather than reasoning processes.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a novel framework called "Financial Bias Indicators" (FBI) to assess LLM rationality in finance. 
- FBI covers two dimensions - Belief Bias and Risk Preference Bias. It evaluates phenomena like anchoring bias, overconfidence, loss aversion etc. based on principles of behavioral finance.
- The framework analyzes LLM reactions to financial news events and decision scenarios to gauge biases. It also examines reasoning processes using methods like topic modeling.

Contributions:
- FBI enables comprehensive LLM evaluation in finance using behavioral finance lens, helping build more reliable financial LLMs.
- The paper conducts extensive analysis on 19 top Chinese & English LLMs regarding impact of model parameters, training data and input formats on financial rationality.
- It provides insights into causes of financial irrationality like inadequate reasoning, temporal data biases, risk preferences - laying groundwork for better model development.
- The focus on Chinese markets addresses a key gap in understanding LLM behavior in specific financial environments.
- Overall, the work advances progress towards more robust and unbiased LLMs that can drive financial sector growth through dependable AI-enabled analysis.
