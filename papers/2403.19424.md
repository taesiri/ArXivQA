# [The Role of Syntactic Span Preferences in Post-Hoc Explanation   Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Post-hoc explanation methods for NLP models often yield diverging attribution scores when ranking the importance of input tokens. This leads to overall low inter-method agreement. 
- The reasons behind the disagreement are not well understood. The paper hypothesizes that different methods may have preferences for highlighting certain linguistic classes of words over others.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze disagreement through the lens of syntactic spans instead of individual tokens. A span is a syntactically coherent group of words, obtained via chunking. 
- Introduce a dynamic way of estimating $k$, the number of most important features. This selects peaks in the attribution signal rather than a fixed number.
- Investigate whether span-level analysis and dynamic $k$ lead to higher agreement between methods.

Key Findings:
- Methods display different preferences for word classes - some target more verbs, others more nouns. This correlates with (dis)agreement.
- Span-level analysis substantially increases agreement over tokens. Dynamic $k$ also improves agreement compared to fixed $k$.
- The threshold for dynamic $k$ is updated to only consider positive attribution scores, filtering negative signals.

Main Contributions:  
- First linguistic analysis showing attribution methods target different word classes, causing token-level disagreement
- Demonstrating improved agreement at span level and with dynamic $k$
- Providing an updated configuration for estimating dynamic $k$

The paper overall aims to better explain disagreement by studying linguistic preferences. It shows that agreement can be improved using spans and dynamic $k$ instead of focusing narrowly on tokens.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper analyzes disagreement between attribution methods from a syntactic perspective, finding they have different preferences for word classes which smooths out at the span level, and proposes refinements to dynamic top-k estimation to improve identification of important spans.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A linguistic analysis of the disagreement between different attribution methods in model interpretability. The authors show that methods have systematic preferences for different word classes (stop words, punctuation, POS tags) that correlate with their level of agreement with other methods and humans.

2) An analysis of agreement at the syntactic span level rather than just the token level. The authors find that methods agree more when evaluated on whether they target the same syntactic constituents/spans, compared to strict token-level agreement.

3) An improvement to the dynamic $k$ estimation algorithm that determines how many of the most important tokens to select from an attribution method's rankings. The authors test different thresholds and propose using only positive attribution scores ($\mu>0$) to better estimate a low but adequate $k$.

4) Showing that dynamic $k$ works well in combination with span-level analysis for several attribution methods, and proposing this as an improved approach over fixed token-level $k$ selections.

In summary, the main contributions are linguistic analysis of disagreement, evaluation of agreement on spans rather than tokens, refinements to dynamic top-$k$ estimation, and showing spans and dynamic $k$ work well together.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Interpretability - The paper focuses on interpreting and explaining machine learning models, specifically regarding feature attribution methods.

- Post-hoc explanation - The paper analyzes disagreement between different post-hoc explanation methods that aim to explain model predictions. 

- Attribution methods - Methods like LIME, Integrated Gradients, etc. that assign importance scores to input features to explain model outputs.

- Disagreement - The paper studies reasons why different attribution methods yield diverging explanations and importance rankings. 

- Syntactic spans - The paper proposes evaluating agreement between methods at the level of syntactic constituents rather than individual tokens. 

- Dynamic k - Estimating the number of most important features per instance dynamically based on attribution profile properties. 

- Word class preference - Finding that different methods systematically prefer highlighting certain word classes over others.

- Faithfulness - Whether explanations faithfully reflect the model's reasoning is linked to inter-method agreement.

So in summary, key terms cover interpretability, specifically using attribution methods and analyzing their disagreement, improvements in evaluating agreement, and connections to faithfulness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes using syntactic spans instead of individual tokens when measuring agreement between attribution methods. What is the intuition behind this idea and why might spans provide a better indication of agreement than tokens?

2) The paper finds that different attribution methods have preferences for highlighting certain word classes over others. How could you further analyze these preferences linguistically (e.g. in terms of other syntactic or semantic properties) to better understand disagreements?  

3) The paper proposes an approach for dynamically estimating $k$, the number of most important tokens. What are some limitations of using a fixed $k$ value instead? How does the proposed dynamic approach for setting $k$ aim to address these?

4) What were some of the different threshold settings explored when estimating $k$ dynamically? How did the authors evaluate which setting worked best? What implications did this have for certain attribution methods?

5) The paper treats punctuation tokens as separate syntactic spans in the analysis. What is the rationale behind this decision and what are some pros and cons of this approach? How might it have influenced the results?

6) When comparing agreement at the span versus token level, what specifically was the span annotation process and what parser did the authors use? How might this have impacted spans identified and subsequent analyses?  

7) For the NLI task, what are some potential differences in how methods might highlight signals compared to other tasks? How could this affect the generalizability of the span analysis approach?

8) The paper proposes that inter-method agreement may act as a proxy for faithfulness. What are some limitations of using agreement in this way as a faithfulness metric? How could it be supplemented?

9) What types of concentration metrics could be used to further analyze how methods differ in their tendency to highlight redundant tokens within the same span? How might these provide additional insights?

10) The paper focuses on analyzing disagreements linguistically after they occur - what approaches could be used proactively during method design to avoid certain types of disagreements?
