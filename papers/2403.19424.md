# [The Role of Syntactic Span Preferences in Post-Hoc Explanation   Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Post-hoc explanation methods for NLP models often yield diverging attribution scores when ranking the importance of input tokens. This leads to overall low inter-method agreement. 
- The reasons behind the disagreement are not well understood. The paper hypothesizes that different methods may have preferences for highlighting certain linguistic classes of words over others.

Proposed Solution:
- Analyze disagreement through the lens of syntactic spans instead of individual tokens. A span is a syntactically coherent group of words, obtained via chunking. 
- Introduce a dynamic way of estimating $k$, the number of most important features. This selects peaks in the attribution signal rather than a fixed number.
- Investigate whether span-level analysis and dynamic $k$ lead to higher agreement between methods.

Key Findings:
- Methods display different preferences for word classes - some target more verbs, others more nouns. This correlates with (dis)agreement.
- Span-level analysis substantially increases agreement over tokens. Dynamic $k$ also improves agreement compared to fixed $k$.
- The threshold for dynamic $k$ is updated to only consider positive attribution scores, filtering negative signals.

Main Contributions:  
- First linguistic analysis showing attribution methods target different word classes, causing token-level disagreement
- Demonstrating improved agreement at span level and with dynamic $k$
- Providing an updated configuration for estimating dynamic $k$

The paper overall aims to better explain disagreement by studying linguistic preferences. It shows that agreement can be improved using spans and dynamic $k$ instead of focusing narrowly on tokens.
