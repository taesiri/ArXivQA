# [Panacea: Panoramic and Controllable Video Generation for Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16813)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Panacea, a novel approach for generating controllable and panoramic multi-view videos tailored for autonomous driving scenarios. The key innovation of Panacea is the integration of a decomposed 4D attention mechanism alongside a two-stage generation pipeline to produce videos with strong temporal and cross-view consistency. Further, Panacea incorporates both coarse-grained textual control over global attributes like weather and scene type as well as fine-grained control using bird's eye view layout sequences containing objects, roads, and camera poses. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate Panacea's ability to generate high fidelity and controllable multi-view driving videos. Significantly, when used to augment the nuScenes dataset, Panacea-generated synthetic videos lead to consistent performance improvements for the state-of-the-art StreamPETR video perception model, highlighting the value of this technique for advancing autonomous driving systems. Overall, Panacea represents an important leap towards controllable multi-view video generation and holds great promise for diverse real-world applications from dataset augmentation to driving simulation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Panacea proposes an innovative two-stage framework to generate controllable and coherent multi-view driving scene videos by integrating decomposed 4D attention and ControlNet with diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are two-fold:

1. The authors propose Panacea, an innovative approach for multi-view video generation in driving scenes. This two-stage framework integrates existing visual generation technologies while making technical advancements to achieve multi-view and temporal consistency, as well as critical controllability.

2. Through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, Panacea demonstrates its ability to produce high-quality driving scene videos. Results show it can effectively augment training datasets to improve state-of-the-art BEV perception models. The authors plan to release the synthesized video dataset "Gen-nuScenes" to promote research in video generation for autonomous driving.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) proposing the Panacea approach for controllable multi-view video generation, and (2) demonstrating its effectiveness in improving perception models by synthesizing valuable training videos.
