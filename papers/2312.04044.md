# [Residual Graph Convolutional Network for Bird's-Eye-View Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04044)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Residual Graph Convolutional (RGC) network for Bird's Eye View (BEV) semantic segmentation in autonomous driving applications. The key innovation is the RGC module, which employs interconnected spatial and channel graphs to capture contextual relationships between regions, and a downsample residual process to maintain global coordinate information. Specifically, the spatial graph extracts spatial relationships between node features, while the channel graph captures channel dependencies within each node. The residual structure enhances coordinate feature reuse. Additionally, a non-overlapping graph projection efficiently converts the BEV input to graph space, and a reprojection module maps updated features back to the coordinate space. The method also utilizes a segmentation data augmentation and alignment module to enrich features and preserve feature-label alignment. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with the RGC network achieving a mean IoU of 59.7%, outperforming prior arts by over 3%. Ablation studies validate the individual contributions of the proposed RGC and augmentation modules. Both qualitative and quantitative results show accurate segmentation, especially for small and delicate regions, highlighting the benefits of modeling global contextual relationships in the graph domain while retaining coordinate space information.
