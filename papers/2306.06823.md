# [Weakly supervised information extraction from inscrutable handwritten   document images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06823)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we extract medicine names from inscrutable handwritten prescription images using only weakly labeled data?The key points related to this question from the paper are:- Existing OCR models do not perform well on inscrutable handwritten prescriptions with domain-specific words and layouts. - Procuring large datasets with annotations from domain experts for supervised learning is expensive and not scalable.- The paper proposes novel methods to improve existing OCR systems to identify medicine names without using any labeled examples, only using weak image-level labels of medicine names present.- They introduce a weakly supervised segmentation method to identify medicine name regions from just the medicine name labels. - They enhance OCR systems by injecting a domain-specific medicine language model learned from synthetic data.- They also have techniques like fuzzy matching and max-scoring for constrained vocabulary prediction.- These methods help improve an existing OCR system's performance on extracting medicine names from 12% to 48% in their experiments.So in summary, the key hypothesis is around developing techniques to extract medicine names from challenging prescription images using only weak supervision, instead of full manually annotated data. The paper introduces methods for medicine line segmentation and recognition that validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a weakly supervised framework to extract medicine names from handwritten prescription images. The key aspects are:- A weakly supervised method to detect medicine name lines in prescriptions using only image-level labels of medicine names present. This avoids the need for expensive bounding box/polygon annotation.- Learning a medicine name language model using synthetically generated text lines from a probabilistic program. This medicine LM is selectively applied only on the detected medicine name lines to enhance OCR decoding.- A technique to match the OCR predictions to an in-vocabulary set of medicine names by taking majority vote of matches in the top-k decoded paths.Overall, the paper shows how to significantly improve extraction of medicine names from hard to read handwritten prescriptions by selectively incorporating domain knowledge using only weak supervision. The pipeline improves state-of-the-art OCR performance on this task by over 2.5x.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a weakly supervised approach using only medicine name labels to improve extraction of medicine names from challenging handwritten prescription images by learning to detect medicine regions and injecting a medicine-specific language model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper on weakly supervised information extraction from handwritten documents compares to other research:- Most prior works on information extraction from handwritten documents rely on large amounts of annotated or labeled data. This paper proposes a weakly supervised approach that requires only weak image-level labels of the medicine names present, making it more scalable.- The proposed approach is designed specifically for unstructured, free-form handwritten documents like prescriptions. Many existing methods focus on extracting information from structured forms or documents. The free-form nature and illegible handwriting in prescriptions makes this a more challenging problem.- They demonstrate the approach on extracting medicine names, which is domain-specific. Much research on handwritten text recognition uses more generic datasets. Adapting to domain-specific entities like medicines is shown to be beneficial through techniques like specialized language models.- Unique aspects include the medicine line segmentation with only weak labels, generating synthetic data to train medicine language models, and model-dependent matching with vocabulary words. These contribute to significant gains over generic off-the-shelf OCR systems.- The work deals with optical character recognition challenges like illegible handwriting. Many information extraction works assume perfect transcription. Robustness to OCR errors is important for real-world application.- Overall, the paper tackles a very challenging real-world use case of information extraction from handwritten, unstructured prescriptions using a weakly supervised domain adaption approach. It demonstrates sizable improvements over general OCR systems on this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Applying the techniques to other types of documents beyond prescriptions, such as handwritten forms. The methods could likely be generalized to extract information from other types of free-form handwritten documents.- Learning higher-level contextual relationships between the extracted entities and other sections in the documents. For example, using the observations section to help correct errors or ambiguities in extracting medicine names. - Incorporating more advanced language models like transformers instead of n-gram models in the OCR decoder. This could potentially help with longer context.- Reducing the errors from very similar looking medicine names through techniques like incorporating visual features in the language model.- Collecting more training data with diversity in handwriting styles to make the models more robust.- Exploring unsupervised or weakly supervised ways to learn the segmentation model instead of needing the initial strong labels from the labeling functions.- Validating the techniques on documents from other languages and scripts beyond Latin.In summary, the key directions are around improvements to the segmentation and language models, collecting more diverse training data, and applying the techniques to new document types and languages. The core weakly supervised framework seems promising to be generalized.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper focuses on the challenging problem of extracting medicine names from inscrutable handwritten prescription images, using only weakly labeled data (i.e. a list of medicine names per image, without location info). The authors propose a framework that first identifies medicine line regions in the image using weak labels and a combination of OCR and segmentation labeling functions. It then selectively applies a medicine-specific language model, trained on synthetically generated data, when recognizing text in those medicine line regions. Compared to off-the-shelf OCR methods, this approach improves medicine name extraction accuracy by over 2.5x on a dataset of handwritten prescriptions. The main contributions are the weakly supervised medicine line segmentation method, the synthetic data-based medicine language model, and a model-dependent technique to match predictions to an entity vocabulary. The approach is generalizable to extracting other entities beyond medicine names from unstructured handwritten documents.
