# [Navigating the Grey Area: Expressions of Overconfidence and Uncertainty   in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13439)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Are language models (LMs) capable of interpreting expressions of uncertainty and how do LMs' behaviors change when trained to emit their own expressions of uncertainty?

The key points about this research question:

- The paper is focused on studying how expressions of uncertainty (both interpreting and generating them) impacts language model behavior. 

- Specifically, it looks at uncertainty in the context of question answering tasks.

- The linguistic expressions of uncertainty cover things like hedges, factive verbs, evidential markers, etc. 

- The overall goal is to understand if LMs can handle nuanced expressions of uncertainty that are common in human language and decision-making.

- The research involves both studying how uncertainty in prompts impacts LM accuracy, as well as how training LMs to generate uncertainty impacts performance.

So in summary, the central question revolves around whether LMs can properly handle nuanced linguistic expressions of uncertainty, both in interpreting uncertainty in prompts and in generating their own uncertain language. The goal is to improve LMs' capabilities on this important aspect of language use.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a framework and analysis on how expressions of uncertainty interact with large language models, focusing on the question answering setting. 

2. It introduces a typology of 50 expressions of uncertainty, categorized by linguistic features like hedges, factive verbs, evidential markers, etc. This allows a systematic analysis of how these different types of uncertainty impact language model generation.

3. The experiments demonstrate that model accuracy suffers when models use expressions of certainty like factive verbs or idiomatic language like "I'm 100% certain".

4. The results suggest that GPT3 struggles to emit expressions of certainty in a calibrated manner, but that teaching the model to express uncertainty leads to better calibration without sacrificing accuracy. 

5. The paper illustrates the need to analyze language models through the lens of uncertainty expressions, especially as they are deployed in real-world decision-making settings. It offers recommendations on training models that can generate reliable and calibrated expressions of uncertainty.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how uncertainty expressions interact with large language models, using both zero-shot prompting and in-context learning. The key finding is that certainty actually hurts performance, while uncertainty improves calibration. This highlights important considerations in building trusted NLG systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper argues that major gaps remain between how humans and AI systems use language, especially in expressing and interpreting uncertainty. The key findings are that language models struggle to interpret uncertainty in prompts in an accurate, calibrated way and also fail to generate well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty when trained to do so. The main takeaway is that understanding and properly handling uncertainty is a critical challenge in developing trustworthy language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Focus on natural language expressions of uncertainty: This paper focuses specifically on how natural language expressions of uncertainty (hedges, plausibility shields, evidential markers, etc.) impact language model performance. Much prior work has focused only on extracting or representing numerical uncertainty values. Studying natural language expressions provides new insights.

- Analysis of both interpretation and generation: The paper looks at how models interpret uncertainty when it's present in prompts, as well as how well models can generate appropriate uncertainty expressions. Many papers focus only on one aspect, while this provides a more comprehensive view. 

- Question answering setting: The experiments are situated in a question answering scenario, which is a practical but understudied setting compared to things like text classification. The QA setting may reveal different behaviors than other tasks.

- Typology of uncertainty expressions: The authors compile a typology of 50 uncertainty expressions, classified linguistically. This allows a more systematic analysis compared to work that uses only a few handpicked expressions.

- Large model analysis: The focus on studying a large 175B parameter model (GPT-3) differs from most work that looks at smaller models. Scale could impact the findings.

- Takeaways for NLG systems: There is an emphasis on drawing conclusions specifically aimed at improving real-world NLG systems, such as recommending a focus on generating uncertainty over certainty.

In summary, while building on related work, the comprehensive study of uncertainty expressions in QA using a large LM, along with a focus on practical implications, differentiate this paper and provide unique contributions to the field. The analysis of linguistic characteristics and model behaviors yields new insights.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Further investigate how humans interpret and react to generated naturalistic expressions of uncertainty from language models. The authors suggest more research is needed on this, as current work has focused on teaching models to generate calibrated uncertainty but not on how humans perceive and use such linguistic uncertainty.

- Explore incorporating spoken expressions of uncertainty into language model training and evaluation. The authors note that weakeners and uncertainty cues likely differ between written and spoken language. 

- Develop methods for verified attribution when generating expressions of uncertainty. The authors encourage exploring ways models can provide valid attributions for their uncertainties to improve transparency and trust. However, they caution against arbitrary unattributed uncertainty that could undermine users.

- Focus on training models to express uncertainty rather than certainty. The authors recommend this as a safer design choice given their findings on poor calibration and brittleness when models express high certainty.

- Study potential negative uses of uncertainty expressions by language models, such as responding with arbitrary doubt or uncertainty to controversial topics. The authors warn researchers should anticipate and mitigate possible misuses.

- Continue developing linguistically calibrated models that can interpret and generate nuanced uncertainty in decision-making contexts. The authors highlight this as an important direction given the prevalence of uncertainty in real-world data and language.

In summary, the key suggested directions are: studying human reactions, incorporating spoken language, verifying attributions, preferring uncertainty over certainty, anticipating misuses, and advancing calibrated models that handle uncertainty. Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of these suggestions from the paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper argues that a key missing component in our understanding of language models is their ability to interpret and generate naturalistic expressions of uncertainty. The authors conduct experiments injecting verbal uncertainty prompts into question answering and find that GPT3's accuracy varies significantly based on the expression, with drops when certainty is expressed. Analyzing the linguistic features, they find losses with factive verbs and gains with evidential markers. In teaching GPT3 to generate its own uncertainty, calibration improves when learning to express uncertainty over certainty. Overall, the work illustrates challenges in getting models to produce trustworthy uncertainty and suggests focusing on generating linguistic uncertainty could support human decision-making.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper argues that a key missing component in our understanding of language models is their ability to interpret and generate natural expressions of uncertainty. Humans constantly use linguistic markers of uncertainty like hedges, strengtheners, evidentials, and factive verbs when communicating, in order to convey nuance and limitations of information. However, most prior work on uncertainty in language models has focused on extracting statistical confidence scores rather than modeling natural language. 

The authors perform experiments analyzing how language models respond to verbal uncertainty markers in prompting and how their generations change when trained to emit uncertainty. They find that accuracy significantly varies based on the expression used, with losses when certainty is expressed through devices like factive verbs. They also find better calibration when models learn to express uncertainty rather than certainty. Overall, their results illustrate gaps in language models' abilities to reliably generate calibrated linguistic uncertainty, highlighting the need to further study uncertainty as models are deployed in real-world settings.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates how expressions of uncertainty affect the performance of language models (LMs) in question answering tasks. The authors use two main methods. First, they inject different verbal expressions of uncertainty (e.g. "I think it's...", "Maybe it's...") into trivia question prompts and evaluate how the uncertainty affects the accuracy of GPT-3's answers across several QA datasets. Second, they use in-context learning to teach GPT-3 to generate its own expressions of uncertainty or certainty based on the model's confidence, and analyze how this impacts calibration. Overall, the main method is systematically manipulating expressions of uncertainty in prompts and generations to understand their effect on LM performance in QA.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of language models' (LMs) ability to interpret and generate naturalistic expressions of uncertainty. Some key questions it investigates are:

- Are LMs able to understand and appropriately respond to expressions of uncertainty when prompted with them? 

- How does a LM's behavior change when trained to generate its own expressions of uncertainty?

- Do certain types of uncertainty expressions like hedges or factive verbs systematically affect a LM's performance?

- Is a LM well calibrated in how it responds to and emits uncertainty? For example, does expressing high certainty lead to more accurate responses?

The overarching problem is that properly handling uncertainty is critical for real-world NLP tasks but there has been little analysis on whether large LMs can properly interpret and generate verbal expressions of uncertainty. The paper helps fill this gap and highlights challenges models still face in handling nuanced linguistic uncertainty.
