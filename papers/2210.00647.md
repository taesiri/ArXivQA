# [IntrinsicNeRF: Learning Intrinsic Neural Radiance Fields for Editable   Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00647)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we introduce intrinsic image decomposition into neural radiance fields (NeRF) to enable editable novel view synthesis for complex scenes beyond just objects?The key ideas and contributions appear to be:- Proposing an "IntrinsicNeRF" framework that integrates intrinsic decomposition into NeRF, allowing it to jointly learn view-independent reflectance, shading, and view-dependent residual terms. - A distance-aware point sampling method to help satisfy novel view synthesis and intrinsic decomposition constraints.- An adaptive reflectance iterative clustering method using mean shift clustering to handle inconsistencies in reflectance.- A hierarchical clustering and indexing approach using semantics to enable real-time editing for room-scale scenes.- Demonstrating the ability to edit and relight both synthetic and real scenes in novel views through intrinsic decomposition with NeRF.So in summary, the paper introduces intrinsic decomposition into NeRF to expand its capability for editable novel view synthesis from just objects to full scenes, through a combination of technical innovations like the clustering and sampling methods.
