# [IntrinsicNeRF: Learning Intrinsic Neural Radiance Fields for Editable   Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00647)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we introduce intrinsic image decomposition into neural radiance fields (NeRF) to enable editable novel view synthesis for complex scenes beyond just objects?

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Proposing an "IntrinsicNeRF" framework that integrates intrinsic decomposition into NeRF, allowing it to jointly learn view-independent reflectance, shading, and view-dependent residual terms. 

- A distance-aware point sampling method to help satisfy novel view synthesis and intrinsic decomposition constraints.

- An adaptive reflectance iterative clustering method using mean shift clustering to handle inconsistencies in reflectance.

- A hierarchical clustering and indexing approach using semantics to enable real-time editing for room-scale scenes.

- Demonstrating the ability to edit and relight both synthetic and real scenes in novel views through intrinsic decomposition with NeRF.

So in summary, the paper introduces intrinsic decomposition into NeRF to expand its capability for editable novel view synthesis from just objects to full scenes, through a combination of technical innovations like the clustering and sampling methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Proposing intrinsic neural radiance fields (IntrinsicNeRF) which introduce intrinsic image decomposition into neural radiance fields (NeRF). This allows modeling the reflectance, shading, and residual layers of both object-level and room-scale 3D scenes for editable novel view synthesis. 

2. Presenting a distance-aware point sampling method and adaptive reflectance iterative clustering optimization to enable training IntrinsicNeRF in an unsupervised manner with traditional intrinsic decomposition constraints.

3. Proposing a hierarchical clustering method with coarse-to-fine optimization for room-scale scenes. This allows fast hierarchical indexing to handle cases where different instances of similar materials may be incorrectly clustered together.

4. Demonstrating compelling augmented reality applications enabled by IntrinsicNeRF such as real-time recoloring, relighting, and editable novel view synthesis on both synthetic and real-world data.

5. Extensive experiments on object-level and room-scale datasets showing IntrinsicNeRF can achieve multi-view consistent intrinsic decompositions and high-fidelity novel view synthesis even for challenging sequences.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be introducing intrinsic image decomposition into neural radiance fields in a way that is trainable without supervision and enables editable novel view synthesis for both objects and room-scale scenes. The proposed techniques to achieve this unsupervised training and handle material similarity seem important to making this possible.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper presents an intrinsic neural radiance field framework that introduces intrinsic image decomposition into neural rendering, enabling editable novel view synthesis for both object and room-scale scenes.

In slightly more detail, the paper proposes IntrinsicNeRF, which trains an implicit neural radiance field to directly predict a decomposition into reflectance, shading, and residual terms. This allows generating novel views of a scene while also editing intrinsic components like reflectance colors. The method uses unsupervised losses and iterative clustering to enable training on real scenes without ground truth decomposition data. Experiments show it can decompose and render editable views for both synthetic objects and indoor room environments.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related work in intrinsic image decomposition and neural rendering:

- Compared to traditional intrinsic image decomposition methods like IIW, CGIntrinsics, and USI3D, this paper introduces a neural rendering framework (NeRF) to perform decomposition in a view-consistent manner. Traditional methods operate on single images, while this approach leverages multi-view consistency.

- Compared to neural rendering works like NeRF and others, this paper incorporates intrinsic decomposition objectives and constraints to factorize the scene into interpretable layers like reflectance and shading. Other neural rendering methods focus solely on view synthesis. 

- Compared to NeRF-based inverse rendering methods like NeRFactor, PhySG, and InvRender, this paper targets decomposition of full scenes rather than just objects. Those other methods rely heavily on accurate geometry from meshes or implicit functions, which limits their applicability beyond objects.

- The proposed IntrinsicNeRF method does not require ground truth training data and is trained in a completely unsupervised manner using various intrinsic image priors. Other learning-based methods require large supervised datasets.

- The reflectance clustering method in IntrinsicNeRF addresses inconsistencies across views by adaptively clustering colors, compared to predefined clustering in prior video intrinsic decomposition work.

- Hierarchical clustering in IntrinsicNeRF helps distinguish objects with similar reflectance, improving over basic reflectance clustering.

In summary, IntrinsicNeRF demonstrates intrinsic decomposition of scenes with neural rendering, without the need for ground truth supervision or accurate geometry. This expands the capability of neural radiance fields to provide an editable decomposition, compared to pure view synthesis in prior work. The integration of multi-view information and intrinsic priors is a key advantage compared to single image methods.
