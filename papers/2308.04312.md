# [Interpretable Goal-Based model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in   Interactive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting vehicle trajectories in interactive environments like intersections is important for autonomous driving systems. However, it is a challenging task due to the uncertainty in interactions between the ego vehicle and other road users.  
- While neural network models have shown good performance, they lack interpretability in their predictions. This is problematic for safety-critical applications like self-driving cars.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a model that combines a discrete choice model (DCM) with a neural network to get both high accuracy and interpretability. 
- The DCM component provides interpretable high-level goals for the vehicle using hand-crafted utility functions that encode expert knowledge about driving behavior. 
- The neural network component uses an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture with a spatial grid representation and multi-head self-attention to model complex interactions. 
- The DCM goal probabilities are combined with the neural network hidden states using the Learning Multinomial Logit framework to get the final goal prediction.
- Trajectories are then generated conditioned on the predicted goal.

Main Contributions:
- A novel model for vehicle trajectory forecasting that combines the interpretability of a DCM with the accuracy of a neural network model.
- Comparative study of different DCM utility functions for modeling interactive driving behavior.
- Visualizations that provide insight into the high-level goals predicted by the model and the influence of the DCM vs the neural network.
- Strong performance on the complex INTERACTION dataset without using HD maps, showing the ability to model interactions.
- The architecture provides a way to enable trust in neural network predictions for safety-critical autonomous driving systems.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution towards interpretable models for interactive trajectory forecasting by combining knowledge-based and learned components. The results highlight the promise of such hybrid approaches for self-driving vehicles.
