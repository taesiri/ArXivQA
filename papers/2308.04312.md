# [Interpretable Goal-Based model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in   Interactive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04312)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Predicting vehicle trajectories in interactive environments like intersections is important for autonomous driving systems. However, it is a challenging task due to the uncertainty in interactions between the ego vehicle and other road users.  
- While neural network models have shown good performance, they lack interpretability in their predictions. This is problematic for safety-critical applications like self-driving cars.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a model that combines a discrete choice model (DCM) with a neural network to get both high accuracy and interpretability. 
- The DCM component provides interpretable high-level goals for the vehicle using hand-crafted utility functions that encode expert knowledge about driving behavior. 
- The neural network component uses an encoder-decoder LSTM architecture with a spatial grid representation and multi-head self-attention to model complex interactions. 
- The DCM goal probabilities are combined with the neural network hidden states using the Learning Multinomial Logit framework to get the final goal prediction.
- Trajectories are then generated conditioned on the predicted goal.

Main Contributions:
- A novel model for vehicle trajectory forecasting that combines the interpretability of a DCM with the accuracy of a neural network model.
- Comparative study of different DCM utility functions for modeling interactive driving behavior.
- Visualizations that provide insight into the high-level goals predicted by the model and the influence of the DCM vs the neural network.
- Strong performance on the complex INTERACTION dataset without using HD maps, showing the ability to model interactions.
- The architecture provides a way to enable trust in neural network predictions for safety-critical autonomous driving systems.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution towards interpretable models for interactive trajectory forecasting by combining knowledge-based and learned components. The results highlight the promise of such hybrid approaches for self-driving vehicles.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an interpretable goal-based model for vehicle trajectory prediction that combines a discrete choice model for goal prediction with a neural network for full trajectory prediction to achieve both interpretability and high accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an interpretable goal-based model for vehicle trajectory prediction that combines the interpretability of a discrete choice model (DCM) with the accuracy of a neural network-based model. Specifically:

- They propose an architecture that combines a DCM module with a neural network module using the Learning Multinomial Logit framework to predict high-level goals for the target vehicle. The DCM provides interpretability while the neural network captures complex interactions.

- They design and compare two utility functions for the DCM that model aspects like keeping direction, occupancy, and collision avoidance.

- They evaluate their model on the challenging INTERACTION dataset and demonstrate its ability to make accurate predictions while also providing visualizations to interpret the influence of the DCM and neural network on the goal prediction.

- Their experiments show the model can match or exceed the performance of other approaches on trajectory forecasting metrics while also outputting interpretable goals.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling interpretability in vehicle trajectory forecasting by combining knowledge-based and neural network models, providing both accurate predictions and model transparency.
