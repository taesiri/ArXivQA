# [A Simple Recipe for Contrastively Pre-training Video-First Encoders   Beyond 16 Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07395)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper explores video-first vision-language models for understanding long videos. It systematically analyzes memory-efficient methods to scale video transformers to longer contexts beyond 16 frames. Specifically, it compares four approaches: efficient attention mechanisms like factorized attention, parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation using techniques like MLP adapters, input token masking, and multi-resolution patchification. 

Through extensive experiments, the paper finds that simply masking a large portion of the input video frames (up to 75%) during pre-training is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory requirements while maintaining performance. This allows the model to scale up to process 4.3 minutes of video at 1 FPS. The paper introduces LongViViT, adapted from ShortViViT (a video-first model) to longer contexts using video masking and progressive layer freezing.

LongViViT with around 1B parameters outperforms modular approaches using large language models for aggregation on video understanding tasks with long-range temporal dependencies, like the YouCook2 and EgoSchema benchmarks. It shows the value of learning long-range visual dependencies directly compared to relying solely on language models, which fail to resolve ambiguities.

The paper also shares insights from an analysis of video benchmarks - finding that many current ones do not adequately test temporal understanding. It argues there is a need for more fine-grained video-language benchmarks focused specifically on modeling longer-range temporal dependencies in videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores memory-efficient methods to scale video-first vision-language models to longer video contexts, finding that high degrees of input masking enables training encoders on up to 4.3 minutes of video while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors systematically analyze the memory/accuracy pareto-frontier of video-first vision-language models, evaluating many architectural, data, and training alternatives. They identify a simple recipe that enables scaling to videos over 4 minutes long, much longer than comparable video-language models.

2. They identify short and long video benchmarks with substantial temporal dependencies, for which they demonstrate that the traditional image-first, late-temporal fusion recipe is weaker than a video-first approach. 

3. They compare their long video models to various strong baselines and show competitive performance with far fewer parameters. This includes baselines using LLM-based aggregation over visual captions, which they quantitatively evaluate on video benchmarks for the first time.

In summary, the main contribution is providing a systematic exploration to scale video-first models to longer sequences in a memory-efficient manner, demonstrating their effectiveness over modular approaches on benchmarks with richer temporal signals, and analyzing the temporal complexity of various video understanding benchmarks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Video-first architectures - The paper explores video-first models with early temporal aggregation rather than image-first models. 

- Long-range visual dependencies - Understanding long, real-world videos requires modeling long-range visual dependencies over time.

- Memory-efficient methods - The paper systematically analyzes different methods like attention factorization, parameter-efficient adaptation, input masking, and multi-resolution patchification to scale up video models without blowing up memory costs.

- Input masking - One of the most effective and simple methods they find is randomly masking up to 75% of input video frames during pre-training, which provides a good tradeoff between performance and memory requirements.

- Short-to-long video training - They propose a two-stage training process, first on short videos then adapting the models to longer videos while freezing parameters, which is memory-efficient.

- Long video benchmarks - The paper identifies and evaluates on video datasets requiring longer temporal understanding like YouCook2 and EgoSchema.

- Video-to-text models - The end goal is building large-scale video-to-text models for tasks like video summarization and question answering, which they demonstrate on long videos.
