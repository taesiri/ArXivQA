# [A Simple Recipe for Contrastively Pre-training Video-First Encoders   Beyond 16 Frames](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding long, real-world videos requires modeling long-range visual dependencies. However, capturing long-range visual content is challenging even with large language models (LLMs). 
- Existing methods are limited to short videos (<30 secs) and use image encoders with late temporal fusion rather than video-first architectures. This may limit ability to process complex temporal dynamics.  
- Scaling video-first models is challenging due to quadratic growth of memory and compute with sequence length.

Proposed Solution:
- Explore the memory/accuracy tradeoff of video-first models using various techniques: efficient attention, parameter-efficient adaptation, input masking, multi-resolution encoding.
- Find that simply masking large portions (up to 75%) of video during pre-training is most effective for scaling encoders for up to 4.3min videos at 1 FPS.
- Propose a 2-stage approach: (1) image-to-short video adaptation, (2) short-to-long video adaptation by masking input and freezing encoder layers.  
- Apply approach to scale video-to-text model to 1B parameters on 256-frame videos, without architectural complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Systematic analysis of memory/accuracy tradeoff for video-first models, evaluating architectural, data and training options.
- Identification of simple method to scale encoders to 4.3min videos, much longer than prior video-language models.
- Competitive video-to-text model that outperforms modular LLM-based approaches on summarization/QA tasks needing long-range temporal modeling.
- Analysis of video benchmarks revealing which have strong temporal dependencies, to guide research.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an effective approach to scale video-first models to longer videos using simple techniques like input masking, outperforming complex modular methods. The analysis also provides insights into designing and evaluating video-language models.
