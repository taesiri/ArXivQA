# [A Lip Sync Expert Is All You Need for Speech to Lip Generation In The   Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10010)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we accurately lip-sync arbitrary talking face videos to match any target speech in a speaker-independent manner?The key points are:- The paper aims to lip-sync talking face videos to any target speech, without being limited to specific identities or voices that the model has seen during training. This makes the task more challenging.- Existing speaker-independent models work well for static images but fail to accurately lip-sync unconstrained videos. The generated videos contain significant out-of-sync portions. - The paper hypothesizes two main reasons for the poor performance of existing models on unconstrained videos: (1) The reconstruction loss is inadequate to enforce correct lip shapes (2) The lip-sync discriminators used are weak and get confused by artifacts in generated faces.- To address these issues, the paper proposes to use a pre-trained expert lip-sync discriminator that is accurate on real videos and is not fine-tuned further on the generated faces. This guides the generator to achieve accurate lip-sync.So in summary, the main research question is how to achieve accurate and realistic lip-sync on arbitrary talking face videos in a speaker-independent manner, which existing models fail to do satisfactorily.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel lip-synchronization network called Wav2Lip that generates significantly more accurate lip-sync for arbitrary talking face videos compared to previous methods. - Proposing a new evaluation framework, including new benchmarks and metrics, to enable better evaluation of lip synchronization in unconstrained videos.- Collecting and releasing a new Real-world lip-Sync Evaluation Dataset (ReSyncED) to benchmark performance of lip-sync models on completely unseen real videos.- Demonstrating through quantitative metrics and human evaluations that Wav2Lip produces lip-sync accuracy on par with real synced videos, outperforming previous speaker-independent methods by a large margin.In summary, the key contribution is the Wav2Lip model that can enable accurate lip-syncing of arbitrary talking face videos to any speech, along with a rigorous evaluation framework to benchmark such models. This could enable various applications like dubbing videos to new languages or animating computer generated faces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes a novel method called Wav2Lip to generate highly accurate and realistic lip synchronization in talking face videos for arbitrary voices and identities. The key idea is to train the model using a pre-trained expert lip sync discriminator that provides strong supervision for generating natural lip movements that closely match the input speech.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in speech-driven talking face video generation:- It focuses on speaker-independent lip syncing of arbitrary videos "in the wild". This is in contrast to many prior works that are limited to specific speakers or constrained datasets. The goal is a practical model that can work for any identity and any speech input.- It proposes a new model architecture, Wav2Lip, that uses a pre-trained SyncNet lip sync discriminator to achieve more accurate lip sync. Other recent models like Speech2Vid and LipGAN used weaker lip sync losses during training.- The paper argues current evaluation protocols have issues, like sampling random frames rather than random speech. It proposes new metrics and benchmarks for properly evaluating lip sync accuracy. It also collects a new real-world evaluation dataset.- Experiments show Wav2Lip substantially outperforms prior arts like Speech2Vid and LipGAN on the proposed benchmarks. The model generalizes well to unseen datasets without fine-tuning.- Wav2Lip is the first speaker-independent model to achieve lip sync accuracy on par with real synced videos according to the metrics. Human evaluations also prefer Wav2Lip over 90% of the time.- The paper discusses potential positive applications as well as ethical concerns around fake content generation. It will release code and models publicly.In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in lip syncing arbitrary videos to match any speech input. The new model, evaluation framework, results and discussions significantly advance the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Synthesizing expressions and head poses along with accurate lip movements. The current work focuses mainly on generating accurate lip sync, but the authors suggest extending it to also generate natural facial expressions and head movements that match the speech.- Extending the model to generate full talking face videos instead of just the lower face portion. The current model generates only the lower half of the talking face, but generating the full face region could allow for more applications.- Improving lip sync for synthetic speech, especially from text-to-speech systems. The results in Table 4 show there is still room for improvement in syncing to synthetic speech inputs.- Developing better metrics and benchmarks for evaluating lip sync in videos. The authors propose new metrics and a real-world benchmark, but suggest further improvements could be made to evaluation protocols.- Exploring ways to ensure fair use and prevent misuse of lip sync models. The authors briefly discuss ethical concerns, and suggest more work can be done to promote fair use of such models.- Applying similar techniques to related domains like generating body movements and gestures from speech. The core ideas could potentially be extended to generating other aspects of human movement and behavior from speech.In summary, the main future directions are developing more holistic talking face generation, improving results on synthetic speech, advancing evaluation methods, and extending the core ideas to related problems around generating human behaviors from speech.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach called Wav2Lip for generating accurate lip synchronization in talking face videos. Previous speaker-independent methods work well on static images but fail to accurately morph lip movements in dynamic videos, resulting in out-of-sync segments. The authors identify issues with using only reconstruction losses or weak discriminators in prior works. Their key idea is to train the generator to produce accurate lip sync by learning from a pre-trained expert discriminator that evaluates real synced videos. They also propose new benchmarks and metrics to reliably evaluate lip sync in videos. Experiments show their model produces significantly better lip sync than previous approaches across various datasets. Human evaluations indicate the generated videos have sync accuracy comparable to real synced videos and are preferred over 90% of the time. The model enables various applications like dubbing videos or animating CGI faces.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a novel approach called Wav2Lip that generates accurate lip synchronization for arbitrary talking face videos. The key idea is to train a lip synchronization generator network using a pre-trained "expert" lip sync discriminator, rather than training a discriminator from scratch as in prior work. The authors identify issues with prior methods, including weak lip sync discrimination and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these, they propose a new evaluation framework with reliable metrics and benchmarks to judge lip sync performance on unconstrained videos. The proposed Wav2Lip model incorporates a powerful pre-trained lip sync discriminator that provides strong supervision to generate natural, accurate lip movements. This approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on quantitative metrics and subjective human evaluations on a variety of test sets. The model generalizes well to unseen real-world videos, producing results comparable to real synced videos. The authors also collect and release a new challenging benchmark of real videos for evaluating lip sync in the wild. Overall, this work represents an important advance in speaker-independent speech-driven lip synthesis for unconstrained talking face videos.
