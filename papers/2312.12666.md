# [Incremental Semi-supervised Federated Learning for Health Inference via   Mobile Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mobile sensing data collected from smartphones can be used for health inference tasks like recognizing influenza symptoms. However, centralized storage and processing of such sensitive data raises privacy concerns.  
- Long-term continuous mobile sensing generates large volumes of streaming data. Retraining models on all data is computationally prohibitive on mobile devices. Only using new data causes catastrophic forgetting in models.
- Limited labeled crowd-sourced mobile sensing data leads to lack of robustness in supervised learning models.

Proposed Solution - FedMobile:
- An incremental semi-supervised federated learning approach to address the above challenges.

Key Features:
- Federated Learning allows collaborative model training without sharing local data, preserving privacy.
- Knowledge Distillation transfers knowledge from expert to apprentice models, enabling incremental updates on new data without catastrophic forgetting. 
- Consistency Regularization leverages unlabeled data to improve model robustness by penalizing sensitivity to perturbations.

Contributions:
- Proposes FedMobile, an incremental semi-supervised federated learning algorithm to train models on streaming mobile sensing data in a privacy-preserving and online manner.
- Integrates Knowledge Distillation and Consistency Regularization to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and enhance model robustness.
- Demonstrates effectiveness of FedMobile on influenza symptom recognition using a real-world mobile sensing dataset of over 800 participants, outperforming baselines.
- Shows FedMobile achieves comparable performance to centralized training without compromising privacy.

In summary, the paper presents FedMobile, an incremental semi-supervised federated learning approach for mobile health applications. It addresses key challenges of privacy, catastrophic forgetting, and label scarcity for effective on-device deployments.
