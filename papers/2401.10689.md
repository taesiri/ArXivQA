# [A Lightweight Multi-Attack CAN Intrusion Detection System on Hybrid   FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicles are becoming more connected, enabling new capabilities like autonomous driving. However, this is compromising security as legacy in-vehicle networks like Controller Area Network (CAN) lack authentication and are vulnerable to attacks.

- Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) using machine learning can detect attacks like denial-of-service and fuzzing. However, most require GPUs and consume significant power, making them impractical. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a lightweight multi-attack IDS model deployed on a hybrid FPGA-based electronic control unit (ECU). 

- The model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) quantized to 8-bits. It is mapped to Xilinx's Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU) IP and controlled via APIs.

- The CAN bus traffic is monitored by the ECU software tasks. Relevant packet features are extracted and fed to the DPU accelerator executing the IDS model.

Main Contributions:

- Achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques for detecting denial-of-service and fuzzing attacks (99.92% precision, 100% recall for denial-of-service).

- Reduces per-message processing latency by 25.08% compared to prior art while consuming only 2W.

- Enables co-existence of ECU function and IDS on the same chip with minimal design changes.

- Proposed architecture and model facilitates practical deployment of IDS in vehicles by striking a balance between accuracy, latency and power.

In summary, the paper presents a power-efficient FPGA-based IDS solution using a quantized CNN model for practical in-vehicle deployment with high accuracy and low latency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a lightweight deep learning model for multi-attack intrusion detection on automotive Controller Area Networks, deployed on a hybrid FPGA-based electronic control unit architecture to enable real-time detection with minimal impact on existing ECU functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is a lightweight multi-attack machine learning model for intrusion detection that is integrated into a hybrid FPGA-based ECU architecture. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a lightweight deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can detect denial-of-service and fuzzing attacks on a CAN bus with over 99% accuracy and low false positive/negative rates.

- This model is quantized and deployed on a Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA using a Deep Learning Processing Unit (DPU) accelerator IP. This allows the intrusion detection system (IDS) to be tightly coupled with the ECU application software running on the FPGA's ARM cores.

- Compared to state-of-the-art CAN bus IDS implementations on GPUs or Raspberry Pis, the proposed approach achieves 25% lower latency per message, consumes much less power (2W vs 54W for a GPU implementation), and allows easier integration into an ECU with minimal software changes.

In summary, the main contribution is an FPGA-accelerated IDS that can detect multiple attack types on CAN with high accuracy and low overhead, making it suitable for real-time in-vehicle deployment. The paper demonstrates this by benchmarking against other IDS approaches on metrics like accuracy, latency and power.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a window approach to capture adjacent sequences of CAN messages as the input to the ML model. What is the rationale behind using a window of 4 successive CAN-IDs as the input? What would be the tradeoffs in using a larger or smaller window size?

2. The paper uses a quantized CNN model for intrusion detection. What is the motivation behind choosing a CNN architecture over other neural network architectures like RNNs or transformers? How does the quantization impact model accuracy and resource utilization on the FPGA?

3. The intrusion detection system is integrated with the ECU software tasks running on the ARM cores of the Zynq SoC. What are the advantages of this tight coupling over implementing the IDS on a separate module or ECU? How does it impact scalability and security?

4. The paper evaluates the model on denial-of-service and fuzzing attacks. What modifications would be needed to detect other types of attacks like spoofing or replay attacks? Would the model generalize well to new, unseen attack types?

5. What tradeoffs are being made in using the Vitis-AI toolflow to map a TensorFlow model onto the Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) IP? Could lower level optimization like using HLS or RTL coding give better performance?

6. The cold-start latency is reported to be 8 seconds. What techniques could be used to reduce this latency further for automotive applications? How critical is this metric?

7. The paper reports extremely low false positive rates. Is there a possibility that the model could be overfit? What additional validation should be done before deployment besides accuracy metrics?  

8. The accuracy metrics are compared to other ML-based intrusion detection systems. How would the performance compare against rule-based or anomaly detection based techniques? What are the pros and cons?

9. The model achieves 25% lower latency compared to state-of-the-art while consuming 54X lower power. What is the source of these gains - model efficiency, quantization, hardware acceleration or a combination? How can this be improved further?

10. The model resource utilization on the FPGA is reported. What is the scalability pathway for higher throughput networks like Automotive Ethernet? Would multiple accelerators be needed or can parallelism be improved?
