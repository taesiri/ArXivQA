# [Towards Learning-Based Gyrocompassing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Determining a platform's initial heading angle (gyrocompassing) is critical for inertial navigation systems (INS), but challenging with low-cost MEMS gyroscopes due to their high noise levels that can override the faint Earth rotation signal used for gyrocompassing. This leads to inaccurate heading estimates.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors propose a deep learning framework with a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) model to learn the complex error patterns of a MEMS gyroscope and compensate for them to enable accurate gyrocompassing.

- They introduce an angle-informed cyclic mean squared error (CMSE) loss function to handle the cyclic nature of angles during training. 

- Data augmentation techniques like rotation, noise addition and bias perturbation are used to expand the training data.

Key Contributions:

(i) Development of a learning framework for gyrocompassing with low-performance MEMS-IMUs by compensating for gyro errors.

(ii) Experimental validation showing 10x reduction in alignment times or over 50% error reduction compared to conventional approaches.

(iii) Release of open-source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility and facilitate future research.

The proposed approach demonstrates significantly improved gyrocompassing capabilities for a MEMS IMU, reducing alignment times from minutes to seconds in a controlled experimental setup. The model adapts well to complex sensor errors unlike model-based techniques. Limitations include applicability to extremely low-grade IMUs and sensitivity to disturbances. Future work should evaluate performance over diverse IMU grades and dynamic conditions.
