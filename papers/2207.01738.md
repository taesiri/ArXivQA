# [Domain-Independent Deception: Definition, Taxonomy and the Linguistic   Cues Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Internet economies and societies face a proliferation of deceptive attacks like fake news, phishing, and disinformation. 
- Prior work has focused on building domain-specific deception detectors, but little attention on domain-independent deception detection.
- Lack of good definitions, taxonomy, datasets, and systematic approaches for domain-independent deception detection.
- Debate around whether universal linguistic cues for deception exist. Some analyses have concluded no such cues exist.

Proposed Solution:
- Provide new computational definition of deception based on exposure of manipulation or goals reducing chances of compliance. Formalize using probability theory.
- Propose comprehensive taxonomy of deception with explicit (agents, goals, etc.) and implicit (motivations, channel, etc.) elements. 
- Critically analyze prior linguistic cue analyses, identify issues like publication bias, dated studies, narrow goals of deception datasets.
- Argue markers likely exist, highlight recent cross-domain deception detection works as evidence.
- Analyze recent deception detection literature (2013-2021) to show gaps remain in feature analysis on diverse deception datasets.

Main Contributions:
- New deception definition and formalization
- Novel, comprehensive deception taxonomy 
- Guidelines and issues for systematic reviews in NLP
- Rebuttal of conclusions about linguistic cues from prior analyses  
- Evidence for existence of markers. Identification of gaps for future work.

The paper clarifies terminology, provides taxonomy to aid domain-independent deception detection, argues against hasty conclusions about linguistic cues, and highlights opportunities for advancing linguistic deception detection given recent ML and NLP progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a new computational definition and taxonomy of deception, analyzes the debate on linguistic cues for deception detection, and argues that there is still potential for identifying general linguistic markers of deception.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The paper proposes a new computational definition of deception formalized using probability theory. 

2. It provides a new taxonomy of deception with explicit and implicit elements to aid in domain-independent deception detection.

3. The paper examines the debate on linguistic cues for deception detection, identifies challenges, and critiques previous work arguing against general linguistic cues. 

4. It provides arguments in favor of the existence of general linguistic markers of deception, contrary to some previous critiques.

5. The paper gives guidelines and desiderata for conducting high quality systematic reviews of deception detection literature.

In summary, the key contribution is scrutinizing claims about linguistic cues for deception, clarifying key issues, and making a case that there is still promise for finding domain-independent markers of deception with recent advances in NLP. The new deception taxonomy, definitions, and guidelines for reviews are also valuable contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new computational definition of deception based on the decline in compliance probability when manipulation is exposed. How exactly is this definition formalized using probability theory? What are some limitations or challenges with this formalization?

2. The paper puts forward a comprehensive taxonomy for real-world deception with several new dimensions such as target, stratagem, goal, dissemination, and timeliness. Can you explain one or two of these new taxonomy dimensions in more detail? How do they further our understanding of deception?  

3. The authors argue that previous critiques concluding no general linguistic cues for deception may be too hasty. What are some of the key issues and biases they identify in those prior systematic reviews? Elaborate on one or two.

4. What are some of the guidelines proposed in the paper for conducting high quality systematic reviews of scientific literature? How could these guidelines be adapted and applied to literature reviews in NLP and ML?

5. The authors claim there is evidence for cross-domain deception detection from certain recent papers. Can you summarize the domain-independent deception datasets used in one or two of those papers? What approaches did they take for cross-domain deception detection?

6. How does the paper analyze and mitigate potential publication bias in prior deception detection literature reviews? What quantitative analysis is done to uncover biases, and what does this analysis reveal?  

7. What recent advances in NLP and ML does the paper argue could enable progress in linguistic deception detection, despite prior pessimistic conclusions? Why do they believe this is worth revisiting?

8. The meta-analyses cited in the paper found low to moderate effect sizes for linguistic cues. However, the authors give some counter-arguments for why this does not rule out their existence or utility. What are one or two of those counter-arguments?

9. What were the key differences observed between the latest surveys and meta-analyses reviewed in the paper, in terms of search methodology and findings regarding linguistic cues? What gaps did this reveal?

10. The paper ultimately argues there is still scope for research on linguistic deception detection. What are a couple specific future directions suggested? What challenges remain to be addressed?
