# [Can a Transformer Represent a Kalman Filter?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06937)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates whether Transformers, a popular deep learning architecture, can represent and approximate the Kalman filter for state estimation and control of linear dynamical systems. The authors construct an explicit Transformer called the Transformer Filter that implements a Gaussian kernel smoothing estimator over previous state estimates. They theoretically show that by tuning the temperature parameter of this kernel, the Transformer Filter can approximate the Kalman filter arbitrarily closely in the sense that the state estimates differ by no more than ε at any time, for any desired ε>0. Furthermore, they prove that incorporating the Transformer Filter into a control loop in place of the Kalman filter in an LQG controller induces closed-loop dynamics that tightly approximate those from using the true LQG controller. As a consequence, the Transformer Filter based controller is weakly stabilizing. The results formally establish connections between Transformers and optimal filtering and control algorithms used extensively in signal processing and control theory.
