# [McCatch: Scalable Microcluster Detection in Dimensional and   Nondimensional Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of detecting microclusters (small clusters) of outliers in datasets. Specifically, it focuses on two challenges: (1) detecting microclusters in non-dimensional datasets like graphs, text, etc. where traditional feature-based methods cannot work, and (2) assigning anomaly scores to both singleton and non-singleton outliers in a unified way. Existing methods fail on one or both challenges.

Proposed Solution - McCatch:
The paper proposes a new method called McCatch that works as follows:

1. It builds an "Oracle Plot" which is a scatter plot of two distances for each data point: (a) distance to its nearest neighbor, and (b) distance of the point's microcluster to the nearest inlier point. 

2. It automatically determines a cutoff distance in a parameter-free way to separate outliers from normal points in this plot. Points above the cutoff on either axis are outliers.

3. The outliers are grouped into microclusters using connectivity of nearest neighbors. Singleton outliers become clusters of size one.

4. It assigns an anomaly score to each microcluster based on a minimum description length principle i.e. how compressible the cluster is when described w.r.t the nearest normal point. The score captures both isolation and size based on proposed axioms.

Main Contributions:

1. Works on any metric dataset, handles non-dimensional data like text, graphs etc.

2. Detects and scores both singleton and non-singleton microclusters effectively.

3. Obeys proposed axioms that match human intuition for scoring clusters.

4. Scalable method with sub-quadratic complexities. 

5. Completely automated and parameter-free ("hands-off").

The method is evaluated on 31 real and synthetic datasets, compared to 11 competitors, and shown to outperform them, especially on non-dimensional data with microclusters. It can find meaningful microclusters in various data types like networks, images etc.
