# [A Knowledge Plug-and-Play Test Bed for Open-domain Dialogue Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03496)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge-based open-domain dialogue systems rely on retrieving relevant knowledge to ground their responses. Prior work uses single-source knowledge, but multiple complementary sources are useful.  
- No existing multi-source dialogue datasets have utterance-level ground truth knowledge for evaluating knowledge selection modules.
- Existing methods assume test knowledge sources are the same as training, which is unrealistic as new sources become available after training.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Multi-source Wizard of Wikipedia (Ms.WoW) dataset with utterance-level knowledge tuples from multiple disjoint sources including OPIEC, semantic frames, Wikidata.
- Knowledge tuples retain semantics of original Wizard of Wikipedia knowledge sentences.
- Formulate dialogue knowledge plug-and-play challenge to test dialogue systems' ability to adapt to new knowledge sources at test time in a zero-shot manner.

Contributions:
- First multi-source knowledge-grounded dialogue dataset with ground truth knowledge selection labels.
- Allows studying effect of multi-source knowledge selection on dialogue quality.
- Test bed for new dialogue knowledge plug-and-play challenge to handle emerging knowledge sources.
- Analysis of knowledge selection and dialogue generation performance when new sources are added at test time.
- Demonstration of differences in usefulness and selection difficulty across knowledge sources.

The paper introduces an important and realistic test bed for improving the robustness of open-domain dialogue systems to new knowledge sources through the dialogue knowledge plug-and-play challenge.
