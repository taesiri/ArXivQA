# [End2End Multi-View Feature Matching with Differentiable Pose   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we improve camera pose estimation by jointly training feature matching and pose optimization in an end-to-end manner?

More specifically, the key ideas and hypotheses explored in this paper are:

- Feature matching and pose optimization are tightly coupled problems that can benefit from being addressed jointly.

- Training a feature matching network with gradients from a differentiable pose optimization objective can help learn to predict matches and confidences that are more valuable for pose estimation.

- Constructing a graph across multiple input views for feature matching allows for more globally informed matching solutions compared to matching on image pairs.

- An end-to-end trainable pipeline that spans multi-view feature matching and differentiable pose optimization can significantly improve the accuracy of pose estimation.

The main hypothesis is that by connecting feature matching and pose optimization into one end-to-end trainable approach, the matches and confidence weights predicted by the matching network can be tailored to the pose estimation task. This is expected to improve pose estimation performance compared to prior work on learned feature matching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable approach for multi-view feature matching with differentiable pose optimization. The main contributions are:

1. An end-to-end pipeline that ties together feature matching and pose optimization. The feature matching network is trained with gradients from the differentiable pose optimization, which guides it to produce matches and confidences tailored for accurate pose estimation.

2. A multi-view graph attention network for joint feature matching across multiple frames. By spanning the graph across multiple images, it facilitates information flow to strengthen matching and confidence prediction. 

In summary, the key ideas are to connect feature matching and pose optimization into one end-to-end trainable approach, and to leverage multi-view information during matching. This is shown to significantly improve pose estimation performance compared to prior work on learned feature matching.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable approach for feature matching and pose estimation that uses a graph neural network for multi-view matching with confidence prediction and integrates a differentiable pose optimization to learn outlier rejection and improve pose accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in multi-view feature matching and pose estimation:

- The key novelty of this paper is the end-to-end trainable pipeline that couples feature matching and pose optimization. Previous learning-based methods like SuperGlue focused only on improving the feature matching, while pose optimization remained a separate downstream step. This paper shows that training the feature matching with gradients from pose optimization significantly improves results.

- The multi-view graph matching approach builds on ideas from SuperGlue but extends it to jointly match multiple frames instead of just image pairs. This allows longer feature tracks and more global context to inform the matching. Other recent works like LoFTR and COTR have also explored multi-scale or coarse-to-fine approaches for wider context, but don't jointly optimize across multiple views like this paper.

- For pose optimization, this paper compares to classical methods like 8-point, RANSAC, and bundle adjustment. Recent works like BA-Net and RegNet introduced differentiable pose solvers for end-to-end training, but focused on improving feature descriptors rather than the matching process. This paper shows the benefits of end-to-end training specifically for learning better feature matching.

- The quantitative results show significant gains over previous methods like SuperGlue, LoFTR, COTR on standard datasets like ScanNet, Matterport3D, and MegaDepth. The multi-view matching and end-to-end optimization seem to make the method much more robust. The ablation studies confirm the individual benefits of the key ideas.

- One limitation is that the method relies on a fixed off-the-shelf feature detector (SuperPoint), rather than end-to-end optimizing the feature detection. So there is room for further improvement by also training the feature extractor in an end-to-end manner.

In summary, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in learning-based feature matching by integrating insights from previous works like SuperGlue and differentiable pose optimization, and showing strong benefits from joint end-to-end training and multi-view reasoning. The results are quite promising for tasks relying on robust feature matching.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the keypoint detector and descriptor. The paper uses SuperPoint for detection and description. The authors note that using more recent methods like ASLFeat could further boost matching and pose estimation performance due to their improved accuracy.

- Jointly training the feature descriptors along with the matching network in an end-to-end manner. Currently, the descriptors are fixed and only the matching module is trained. End-to-end training of descriptors could further improve the features for pose estimation.

- Exploring the incorporation of additional modalities like depth or surface normals to aid matching, especially in textureless regions. The current method only uses RGB images.

- Extending the approach to a full end-to-end SLAM system. The paper focuses on pose estimation, but the authors suggest their method could be an important component in training an end-to-end SLAM pipeline.

- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of datasets, especially those with more diverse imaging conditions. The experiments are limited to indoor and outdoor datasets with relatively similar image characteristics.

- Investigating architectural improvements to the graph neural network, such as exploring alternatives to attention. The multi-view matching currently uses self- and cross-attention.

- Studying how to effectively select the set of images for joint matching. The paper empirically found that jointly matching ~5 frames worked well but did not provide a principled method.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the feature extraction, incorporating additional data modalities, extending to full SLAM, evaluating on more diverse data, and further enhancements to the neural matching architecture. The authors position their work as an initial step towards end-to-end learned SLAM.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end trainable approach to jointly optimize feature matching and pose estimation. It introduces a graph neural network (GNN) for multi-view feature matching that predicts matches and confidence weights tailored for a differentiable pose estimation module. By spanning the graph across multiple frames, matches are predicted jointly across views to strengthen geometric reasoning. The matches serve as weighted constraints in the differentiable pose optimization, which provides supervision signal to the matching network during end-to-end training. This learns to reject outliers and improve the value of matches for pose estimation. Evaluated on indoor ScanNet and Matterport3D datasets, as well as outdoor MegaDepth images, the method outperforms prior work like SuperGlue across a range of metrics. The joint optimization boosts pose accuracy while reducing computation time by rendering RANSAC iterations unnecessary. The multi-view matching further improves robustness in challenging cases of large viewpoint changes or repetitive patterns. Overall, the work demonstrates the benefit of combining feature matching and pose optimization in an end-to-end framework.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable pipeline that jointly optimizes feature matching and camera pose estimation. The method introduces a graph neural network (GNN) for multi-view feature matching that is trained with gradients from a differentiable pose optimization. Specifically, the GNN takes keypoints with descriptors from multiple input images and constructs a graph, where nodes are keypoints and edges capture intra- and inter-image relationships. The GNN refines the keypoint descriptors through message passing to determine matches and confidence weights. These serve as weighted constraints in a differentiable pose optimization composed of a weighted eight-point algorithm and bundle adjustment. By training the feature matching network end-to-end using gradients from the pose optimization, the method learns to produce matches and confidences that improve camera pose estimation. 

The key benefits are: 1) Multi-view matching enables the GNN to leverage information across images to predict matches informed by the global context. This is more effective than matching image pairs in isolation. 2) End-to-end training with pose optimization supervision signals the network to reject outliers and focus on valuable matches, while learning effective confidence weighting. This reduces the need for subsequent outlier filtering, like RANSAC. On indoor datasets ScanNet and Matterport3D, as well as outdoor dataset MegaDepth, the proposed joint feature matching and pose optimization achieves significantly higher pose accuracy metrics compared to recent learned feature matchers SuperGlue, LoFTR, COTR and 3DG-STFM. The method also reduces pose estimation time by over 50\% compared to using RANSAC.
