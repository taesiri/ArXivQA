# [End2End Multi-View Feature Matching with Differentiable Pose   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we improve camera pose estimation by jointly training feature matching and pose optimization in an end-to-end manner?

More specifically, the key ideas and hypotheses explored in this paper are:

- Feature matching and pose optimization are tightly coupled problems that can benefit from being addressed jointly.

- Training a feature matching network with gradients from a differentiable pose optimization objective can help learn to predict matches and confidences that are more valuable for pose estimation.

- Constructing a graph across multiple input views for feature matching allows for more globally informed matching solutions compared to matching on image pairs.

- An end-to-end trainable pipeline that spans multi-view feature matching and differentiable pose optimization can significantly improve the accuracy of pose estimation.

The main hypothesis is that by connecting feature matching and pose optimization into one end-to-end trainable approach, the matches and confidence weights predicted by the matching network can be tailored to the pose estimation task. This is expected to improve pose estimation performance compared to prior work on learned feature matching.
