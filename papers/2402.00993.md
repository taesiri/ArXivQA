## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Evaluating perceptual image quality is challenging due to the complexity of the human visual system. Traditional metrics like PSNR and SSIM do not correlate well with human judgments. Recent learning-based methods have shown promise but still have limitations in terms of generalizability across distortion types and image contents. Accurately assessing the quality of compressed images is particularly difficult due to the complex mixture of artifacts introduced.

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a fusion-based full-reference image quality assessment approach that combines multiple quality metrics to better match human quality judgments. Both semantic/content-based features from object detection models and low-level signal degradations are utilized to capture different aspects of quality. Specifically, results from PieAPP, NIQE, TOPIQ, and HyperIQA are fed into an SVM classifier to produce a final quality score that indicates which image in a pair is higher quality. 

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates limitations of individual quality metrics like SSIM, LPIPS, and no-reference methods on the CLIC2024 challenge compression dataset
- Shows different metrics can complement each other by more accurately assessing quality on images the individual metrics fail on  
- Achieves significantly improved correlation with human judgments by fusing predictions from multiple metrics using an SVM classifier
- Provides in-depth analysis of 15 quality assessment methods on the dataset and shows stacking 4 methods leads to saturation in performance gains
- Establishes new state-of-the-art for the CLIC2024 challenge, obtaining 79.6% accuracy in matching human perceptual preferences

In summary, this paper presents a stacking-based approach to fuse semantic and low-level quality predictions that outperforms existing methods on a difficult compressed image quality assessment task. The fusion mechanism allows complementarity between metrics to be exploited for more robust quality predictions.
