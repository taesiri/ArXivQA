# [Evaluation of LLMs on Syntax-Aware Code Fill-in-the-Middle Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on code generation tasks have limitations. Benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP focus on generating standalone functions from descriptions, not reflecting real-world development workflows. The HumanEval-Infilling benchmark for fill-in-the-middle (FIM) tasks is small, only using 164 Python snippets. There is a need for a large-scale, syntax-aware FIM benchmark spanning multiple languages to assess LLMs' capabilities in common coding practices like expanding existing code.

Proposed Solution:
The authors introduce Syntax-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle (SAFIM), a robust FIM benchmark with 17,720 examples covering algorithmic blocks, control flows, and API calls over Python, Java, C++ and C#. SAFIM uses recent code from Codeforces and GitHub (after April 2022) to avoid test set contamination. It emphasizes syntax-aware completion aligned with code's abstract syntax tree. SAFIM implements various prompt designs and a novel syntax-aware post-processing technique to enable fair comparisons across diverse LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- SAFIM benchmark with 17,720 FIM examples in multiple languages and categories, far larger in scale and scope than prior benchmarks
- Deliberate use of recent code to prevent test set contamination risks 
- Suite of prompt designs compatible with different LLMs
- New syntax-aware truncation algorithm that boosts output quality and ensures fair assessment
- Extensive evaluation of 15 major LLMs, revealing insights on impact of pretraining methods over model size
- Foundation for future research on effective pretraining strategies for code LLMs

In summary, SAFIM pushes forward FIM evaluation for code LLMs through its large-scale, multi-language design, rigorous data selection, specialized prompt and post-processing methods, and extensive experimental analysis. It paves the path for future advances in pretraining techniques for coding tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Syntax-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle (SAFIM), a new benchmark for evaluating large language models on their ability to complete critical code structures like algorithm blocks, control flows, and API calls in a syntax-aware manner across multiple programming languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Syntax-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle (SAFIM) benchmark for evaluating large language models on code fill-in-the-middle tasks. Specifically:

- SAFIM focuses on syntax-aware completions of program structures like code blocks and conditional expressions, covering multiple programming languages. It has 17,720 examples sourced from recent code submissions to reduce data contamination risks.

- SAFIM provides a robust evaluation framework with various prompt designs and novel syntax-aware post-processing techniques to enable accurate and fair comparisons across different types of models.

- Comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs on SAFIM shows the effectiveness of FIM pretraining, challenges beliefs that model size outweighs pretraining methods/data quality, and provides insights into the capabilities of different model families. 

- SAFIM serves as a foundational benchmark for future research into effective pretraining strategies and techniques for developing better code LLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and evaluation of the large-scale, syntax-aware SAFIM benchmark for code fill-in-the-middle tasks, which enables more robust analysis of code LLMs.
