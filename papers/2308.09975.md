# [FinEval: A Chinese Financial Domain Knowledge Evaluation Benchmark for   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09975)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it aims to address is: How can we develop a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the financial domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within a Chinese context? 

The key points are:

- The paper introduces FinEval, a new benchmark designed specifically to assess the financial domain knowledge of LLMs in Chinese. 

- FinEval consists of 4,661 high-quality multiple choice questions covering 34 subjects across Finance, Economy, Accounting, and Certificates. The questions are collected from mock exams to ensure difficulty and comprehensiveness.

- The goal is to fill the gap between the rapid development of general Chinese LLMs and the lack of specialized benchmarks to evaluate their proficiency in the important financial domain. 

- Experiments are conducted to evaluate state-of-the-art Chinese and English LLMs on FinEval. The results show accuracy rates around 70% for GPT-4 but much lower for other models, indicating significant potential for improvement.

- Overall, the central research question is how to develop an effective financial domain knowledge benchmark for Chinese LLMs, and FinEval is proposed as a comprehensive solution to enable more rigorous evaluation and drive further progress in this domain.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that the introduction of FinEval will help advance Chinese LLMs specialized for finance by providing a standardized benchmark for assessment. The paper presents the benchmark and initial experiments to demonstrate its utility.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of evaluating large language models:

- This paper introduces FinEval, a new benchmark dataset specifically designed for evaluating large language models on financial domain knowledge in Chinese. Other benchmarks like SuperGLUE, GLUE, and BIG-Bench focus on general language abilities, while FinEval provides targeted assessment on finance, economy, accounting, and certification exam questions.

- The data in FinEval comes from high-quality sources like mock exams, making it more realistic and challenging compared to benchmarks that use synthesized or simplified examples. Many questions require real-world financial knowledge and advanced reasoning skills. 

- The authors conduct an extensive evaluation of the latest Chinese and English LLMs using FinEval. Most prior work evaluates models on English-only benchmarks, so analyzing Chinese LLMs is a useful contribution. 27 models spanning different languages, sizes, and creators are tested.

- The prompts in FinEval include zero-shot, few-shot, answer-only, and chain-of-thought settings. This allows more comprehensive analysis of the models' reasoning capabilities beyond just accuracy. Many benchmarks focus solely on accuracy metrics.

- While most benchmarks have concentrated on general LLMs, FinEval provides assessment specifically for financial domain models like XuanYuan, BBT-Fin, and Bloomberggpt. Evaluating specialized models is important for driving progress in narrow domains.

Overall, FinEval helps fill an important gap by creating a rigorous, multifaceted benchmark tailored for the Chinese financial domain. Testing the latest state-of-the-art models provides strong baselines and reveals where LLMs still need improvement in specialized financial reasoning abilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Expanding the FinEval benchmark to cover more financial application scenarios beyond just general knowledge evaluation. The authors mention developing benchmarks for financial virtual assistants, financial crime detection, fraud assessment, etc.

- Continuing to track the progress of LLMs on FinEval over time as new models are developed and released. The benchmark provides a way to quantitatively measure advances in financial domain capabilities.

- Developing specialized financial LLMs by leveraging FinEval for instruction tuning. The authors suggest FinEval could be useful for tuning models on financial data before downstream task training.

- Exploring different prompting methods like chain-of-thought more thoroughly. The authors found chain-of-thought did not clearly improve performance across the board, suggesting more research into optimal prompting is needed.

- Incorporating more advanced mathematical and logical reasoning questions into FinEval. The authors note there is room to expand the difficulty of questions, particularly for very advanced models.

- Translating FinEval to other languages beyond Chinese. The authors developed FinEval specifically for Chinese, but suggest adapting it to other languages could be valuable.

- Developing additional resources like corpora to support Chinese financial LLMs. The authors note the lack of Chinese financial data as a challenge.

In summary, the main future directions are expanding FinEval itself, using it to advance financial LLMs, and researching optimal prompting approaches. The authors see FinEval as a starting point to drive progress in financial NLP.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper introduces FinEval, a new benchmark for evaluating the financial domain knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key problem it aims to address is the lack of comprehensive benchmarks tailored for assessing LLMs' proficiency in financial knowledge, particularly within the Chinese language context. 

Some of the key issues and gaps the paper highlights are:

- While there are existing benchmarks for evaluating general capabilities of LLMs, benchmarks focused specifically on financial domains are lacking, especially in Chinese.

- Financial domains have unique complexities and specialized terminology that necessitate tailored evaluations beyond what general benchmarks provide.
