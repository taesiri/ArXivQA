# [Collaborative Control for Geometry-Conditioned PBR Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05919)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Current 3D content generation methods typically output RGB images. However, modern graphics pipelines require physically-based rendering (PBR) material properties for proper shading and relighting. Existing approaches rely on generating RGB images first and then extracting PBR properties through inverse rendering, but this leads to issues with inaccurate lighting in the RGB images and ambiguity in the inverse rendering process. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose directly modeling the joint distribution of RGB images and corresponding PBR properties using diffusion models. They use a pre-trained frozen RGB diffusion model and train a parallel PBR diffusion model, linking the two models together using a novel "Collaborative Control" paradigm. This allows tightly coupling the models while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the base RGB model.

Key contributions:

- Propose the Collaborative Control paradigm to tightly link a frozen pre-trained RGB diffusion model to a newly trained parallel PBR diffusion model for joint RGB and PBR generation

- Show this approach is highly data-efficient, producing high-quality results even with very limited PBR training data, and generalizes well to out-of-distribution text prompts

- Demonstrate compatibility with other control techniques like IP-Adapter by keeping base RGB model frozen

- Compare against baselines using existing paradigms like finetuning base model or sequential generation, showing clear improvements

- Analyze design choices around communication schemes, training budgets, resolutions etc. through extensive experiments

In summary, the key innovation is the Collaborative Control approach to couple a pre-trained frozen RGB model with a PBR model, which allows leveraging the rich knowledge in RGB models for PBR generation while avoiding typical downsides around catastrophic forgetting or need for large datasets.
