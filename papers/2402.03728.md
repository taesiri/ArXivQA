# [Consistent Joint Decision-Making with Heterogeneous Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural models are increasingly used for complex tasks involving multiple interrelated decisions, such as hierarchical classification or procedural reasoning. 
- However, the raw outputs of different models often exhibit inconsistencies and conflicts that must be resolved for safe downstream use.
- Prior techniques like beam search and expert-designed decoders have limitations in ensuring globally optimized and balanced decisions. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes enhancing the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization framework to address decision inconsistencies during inference. 
- ILP allows formulating constraints while maximizing an objective function. 
- The key novelty is transforming the raw probabilities into globally comparable decision weights by incorporating factors like prior probability, entropy (confidence), and expected model accuracy.

- This enables balanced optimization across heterogeneous decisions from diverse models.

Main Contributions:
- Novel scoring function to map raw neural probabilities into optimized ILP variable weights using probability normalization and uncertainty estimation.
- Empirical demonstration of balancing decisions and improving optimization results on tasks like hierarchical classification and procedural reasoning.
- Analysis of different formulations and ablation studies on the factors impacting global inference.
- Significantly increased downstream usability of decisions by improving inter-related decision set correctness.

The proposed techniques are integrated into the DomiKnowS library and shown to outperform conventional ILP and sequential decoding baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction without sacrificing task performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel integer linear programming framework to resolve inconsistencies between decisions from heterogeneous models during inference by mapping raw probabilities into globally comparable values using information about prior probability, confidence, and expected model accuracy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel decision-making framework that promotes consistency among decisions made by diverse models while utilizing external knowledge. Specifically:

- It introduces a method to map predictions from various models into globally normalized and comparable values by incorporating information about decisions' prior probability, confidence (uncertainty), and the models' expected accuracy. This facilitates a more balanced global optimization when resolving inconsistencies.

- It leverages the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) framework to enforce constraints and align interrelated decisions from heterogeneous models during inference. 

- It demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach over conventional baselines on multiple datasets, including tasks like hierarchical image classification and procedural reasoning.

- It shows that by ensuring global consistency, the proposed method can substantially increase the proportion of correct sets of interrelated decisions, enhancing their practical utility in downstream applications.

In summary, the key contribution is a generalizable technique to post-process and align outputs from diverse neural models while retaining or improving performance, without needing to retrain the models. This allows better utilization of different models and constraints in tackling complex tasks requiring correlated decisions.
