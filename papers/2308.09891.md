# [SwinLSTM:Improving Spatiotemporal Prediction Accuracy using Swin   Transformer and LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09891)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve spatiotemporal prediction accuracy by better capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in data. Specifically, the paper proposes that existing CNN-RNN models for spatiotemporal prediction are limited in their ability to capture spatiotemporal dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs. To overcome this limitation, the paper hypothesizes that incorporating a global modeling approach to learn spatial dependencies could enhance the model's capacity for spatiotemporal dependency modeling and improve prediction performance. The main proposal is a new recurrent cell called SwinLSTM that integrates Swin Transformer blocks, which can capture global spatial dependencies through self-attention, with LSTM to model temporal dependencies. The hypothesis is that SwinLSTM will outperform existing models like ConvLSTM by virtue of its ability to learn global spatial correlations to assist spatiotemporal dependency modeling.In summary, the central research question is how to enhance spatiotemporal prediction accuracy, and the core hypothesis is that learning global rather than local spatial dependencies can improve a model's capacity to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and relationships, thereby boosting prediction performance. The proposal of SwinLSTM aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new recurrent cell called SwinLSTM for spatiotemporal prediction tasks. The key points are:- They propose SwinLSTM, which integrates Swin Transformer blocks and a simplified LSTM module, to extract spatiotemporal representations by modeling global spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies.- They construct a predictive network with SwinLSTM as the core for spatiotemporal prediction tasks like video prediction. The network architecture is able to capture spatial and temporal dependencies efficiently.- They evaluate the model on several datasets including Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human3.6m and KTH. Results show that SwinLSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms previous methods like ConvLSTM significantly.- Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of different components in SwinLSTM. Feature map visualization provides insights into how SwinLSTM works.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the SwinLSTM recurrent cell to capture spatial and temporal dependencies more effectively for spatiotemporal prediction tasks. Both quantitative results and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of SwinLSTM.
