# [SwinLSTM:Improving Spatiotemporal Prediction Accuracy using Swin   Transformer and LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09891)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve spatiotemporal prediction accuracy by better capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in data. Specifically, the paper proposes that existing CNN-RNN models for spatiotemporal prediction are limited in their ability to capture spatiotemporal dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs. To overcome this limitation, the paper hypothesizes that incorporating a global modeling approach to learn spatial dependencies could enhance the model's capacity for spatiotemporal dependency modeling and improve prediction performance. The main proposal is a new recurrent cell called SwinLSTM that integrates Swin Transformer blocks, which can capture global spatial dependencies through self-attention, with LSTM to model temporal dependencies. The hypothesis is that SwinLSTM will outperform existing models like ConvLSTM by virtue of its ability to learn global spatial correlations to assist spatiotemporal dependency modeling.In summary, the central research question is how to enhance spatiotemporal prediction accuracy, and the core hypothesis is that learning global rather than local spatial dependencies can improve a model's capacity to capture spatiotemporal dependencies and relationships, thereby boosting prediction performance. The proposal of SwinLSTM aims to test this hypothesis.
