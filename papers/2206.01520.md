## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a survey on computationally efficient methods for neural architecture search (NAS). NAS has become increasingly popular for automatically designing deep neural network architectures for specific tasks. However, NAS is computationally expensive due to the need to train and evaluate a large number of candidate architectures. The paper categorizes computationally efficient NAS methods into proxy-based methods and surrogate-assisted methods. Proxy-based methods use techniques like low-fidelity estimation, one-shot NAS, and network morphism to reduce the cost of evaluating candidate architectures. Surrogate-assisted methods train surrogate models to predict the performance of architectures without explicit training, avoiding the computational overhead. 

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques in both categories. For proxy methods, it covers strategies like early stopping, weight sharing, and network transformation. For surrogate methods, it discusses surrogate types like learning curve prediction, Bayesian optimization, and graph neural networks. It also covers emerging topics like federated NAS and multi-objective NAS. Overall, the survey gives a systematic analysis of techniques to improve NAS efficiency, highlights key challenges like sampling efficiency and model management, and suggests promising future research directions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a computationally efficient neural architecture search (NAS) method based on a surrogate model called E2EPP (End-to-End Performance Predictor). E2EPP uses a random forest regressor as the surrogate model to predict the validation accuracy of a candidate neural network architecture. The network architecture is encoded into a binary string representation, which serves as the input feature vector to the random forest. The random forest is trained on a dataset consisting of encoded network architectures and their corresponding validation accuracies obtained by full training. Once trained, E2EPP can predict the accuracy of new architectures without needing to train them. This allows a population-based search algorithm like an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently explore the architecture space by evaluating networks using the E2EPP predictions instead of full training. Experiments embedding E2EPP within an evolutionary algorithm called AE-CNN show it can find high-performing architectures on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with 8.5 GPU days, demonstrating its efficiency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is providing a comprehensive survey on computationally efficient neural architecture search (CE-NAS). Specifically, it aims to systematically review existing methods for improving the efficiency of performance prediction in NAS algorithms. 

The key problem addressed is the high computational cost associated with training and evaluating candidate neural architectures during neural architecture search. Since NAS methods typically require sampling and assessing a large number of architectures, the computational overhead can become prohibitive. This has been a major bottleneck limiting the practical application of NAS.

To address this problem, the paper categorizes existing approaches into proxy-based NAS and surrogate-assisted NAS. Proxy-based methods aim to speed up performance estimation using techniques like low-fidelity training, weight sharing, and network morphism. Surrogate-assisted NAS methods train surrogate models to predict architecture performance in an end-to-end manner without needing to train each one.

The paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques in both categories, analyzing their principles, architectures, strengths and limitations. It also discusses challenges and promising research directions to further improve computational efficiency and scalability of NAS methods.

In summary, the key question addressed is how to improve the efficiency of performance prediction during neural architecture search in order to make NAS more practical and scalable. The paper surveys the state-of-the-art in computationally efficient NAS techniques aimed at this goal.
