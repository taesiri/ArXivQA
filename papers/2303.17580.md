# HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in Hugging
  Face

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be:"Language can serve as a generic interface for large language models (LLMs) to connect with and manage various AI models, enabling the LLM to act as a controller that can plan, schedule, and coordinate the cooperation of different models to solve complex AI tasks."In other words, the authors hypothesize that by incorporating model descriptions into prompts, LLMs like ChatGPT can effectively select appropriate models and orchestrate their cooperation to handle multimodal inputs and solve sophisticated tasks spanning different domains. The language interface allows the LLM to dynamically connect with various expert models as needed.The key research questions explored are:- Can an LLM leverage model descriptions to automatically select optimal models for different subtasks?- Can an LLM successfully coordinate the execution of multiple models by planning dependencies and handling intermediate results? - CanPrompt engineering with model descriptions provide an effective interface for LLMs to access and direct external AI models?- Can this approach of an LLM directing specialized models expand the capabilities of LLMs to multimodal inputs and diverse complex tasks?The paper proposes HuggingGPT as a framework to test this central hypothesis, using ChatGPT to connect with models on Hugging Face based on their descriptions. The experiments aim to demonstrate the versatility of HuggingGPT across language, vision, speech and other AI tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that language can be a generic interface for LLMs to manage cooperation between AI models, enabling more general intelligence. HuggingGPT explores this idea and provides evidence for the potential of this approach.
