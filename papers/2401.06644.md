## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide, with 1/3 suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy where medications are ineffective
- There is a need for alternative treatments beyond pharmaceuticals, such as systems to predict seizures ahead of time so patients can take precautionary measures

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose SeizNet, an AI-enabled implantable sensor network system for seizure prediction
- It uses both intracranial EEG (iEEG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor data as inputs to Deep Learning (DL) models for classification
- An ultrasonic communication system connects the sensors and gateway for low-power secure communication
- Patient-specific DL models are trained on imbalanced datasets using a novel Focal Loss function 
- Time and channel voting aggregrates predictions across time and sensor channels to improve accuracy
- The gateway node combines iEEG and ECG predictions to make a final determination on pre-seizure state
- In closed-loop configuration, the system can send alerts to patients or stimuli to implanted brain stimulators in response

Main Contributions:
- Novel sensor network architecture for on-body seizure prediction using both iEEG and ECG
- Ultrasonic communications for low-power connectivity of wearable and implantable nodes
- Use of Focal Loss to improve DL training on imbalanced medical data
- Patient-specific models for improved accuracy over population-based models
- Channel and time voting mechanism to reduce variance and false positives
- Experimental results show very high accuracy (>99%) in classifying pre-seizure vs non-seizure states
- Significantly outperforms prior works in sensitivity, specificity and false positive rates
- Offers a promising avenue for improving treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy patients

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative multi-modal seizure prediction system using AI and an implantable sensor network that shows great promise in improving outcomes for epilepsy patients not helped by medications alone. The high accuracy and low false positive rates demonstrate its feasibility for practical use.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 SeizNet is an AI-enabled implantable sensor network system that utilizes iEEG and ECG data with a focal loss deep learning model to accurately predict epileptic seizures in advance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SeizNet, an AI-enabled implantable sensor network system for seizure prediction that achieves high accuracy (>99%) in predicting seizures one hour in advance. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a sensor network architecture comprising iEEG and ECG sensor nodes connected to a gateway that combines their classification outputs to make robust real-time seizure predictions.

2) Designing a deep learning model structure optimized for efficient edge execution that extracts features from raw iEEG and ECG signals. 

3) Addressing the class imbalance in the dataset through a novel focal loss function that improves model training.

4) Demonstrating SeizNet's ability to accurately predict seizures by testing on a large real-world intracranial EEG dataset from epilepsy patients. The system achieves over 99% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, outperforming prior art.

5) Showcasing the potential of using only non-invasive ECG signals, which are easy to collect via smartwatches, to predict seizures with high accuracy (up to 94% sensitivity and 99% specificity).

In summary, the key innovation is the design of an edge-based AI system leveraging both invasive and non-invasive signals through an ultrasonic sensor network to enable robust personalized real-time seizure prediction to empower epilepsy patients.
