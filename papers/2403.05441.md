# [Bayesian Hierarchical Probabilistic Forecasting of Intraday Electricity   Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05441)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Forecasting electricity prices on the continuous intraday (CID) market is important for market stability and integration of renewable energy, but challenging due to high volatility. 
- The years 2021-2022 saw unprecedented volatility in CID prices in Germany, making forecasting especially difficult.
- Most literature has not focused on these volatile recent years. Also, uncertainty in model parameters is typically not fully incorporated.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Bayesian forecasting model to produce full posterior predictive distributions for the CID price index IDFull. This captures parameter uncertainty.  
- The model uses a Gaussian likelihood and weakly informative priors on the regression weights and noise variance. Posterior inference is done using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.
- Features are selected from a large set of 351 potential regressors using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, which is more robust to collinearity than the popular LASSO method.

Main Contributions:
- First Bayesian treatment of CID price forecasting that fully propagates parameter uncertainty
- First forecasting study focused on the volatile 2021-2022 period 
- Detailed guidance on calculating CID indices from raw transaction data  
- Evidence that LASSO feature selection can be improved upon by using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
- Demonstration that while CID prices largely follow a weak-form efficiency hypothesis, the live IDFull benchmark can still be beaten in a statistically significant way
- Extensive reliability and sharpness assessment of the predictive distributions using proper scoring rules
- Sharing of code and data to reproduce the modelling pipeline with state-of-the-art probabilistic programming tools

Overall, the paper makes a strong case for using Bayesian methods and robust feature selection in this domain, while also furthering our understanding of CID market efficiency. The thorough evaluation provides a template for rigorously benchmarking probabilistic forecasts.
