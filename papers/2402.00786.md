# [CroissantLLM: A Truly Bilingual French-English Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lack of transparency in training of large language models (LLMs), with secret datasets and strategies hindering research. Raises legal and ethical issues.
- Strong bias towards English in most LLMs, putting non-English users at a disadvantage. 
- Existing high-performing LLMs require large-scale costly infrastructure to run, hindering widespread adoption.

Proposed Solution:
- Release high-quality, transparent 303B token French corpus spanning diverse sources. Fully filtered and deduplicated. Largest of its kind.
- Train 1.3B parameter CroissantLLM model on 1:1 ratio of English and French data plus code. Use custom tokenizer optimized for both languages. Goal is less English bias.
- Craft novel French benchmark, FrenchBench, to evaluate language abilities. Tasks cover classification, reasoning, knowledge, generation.
- Release model fully open-source. Train 3x longer than compute optimal for efficiency. Model runs easily on consumer hardware.

Main Contributions:
- French corpus release, enabling future LM work.
- Pioneer training of intrinsically balanced bilingual LM. Study impact of language ratios.
- FrenchBench to promote evaluation beyond English.
- Highly optimized 1.3B model released for research and industry use. State-of-the-art efficiency.
- Achieve 81% on FMTI transparency criteria, far beyond most models.

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations around transparency, English bias, and costly models by pioneering a bilingual modeling approach and releasing optimized efficient models alongside rich corpora and evaluation suites to enable impactful future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces CroissantLLM, a 1.3B open-source French-English language model trained on a balanced bilingual corpus, which achieves strong performance on benchmarks in both languages while being transparent and easy to deploy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of a highly-curated, diverse 303 billion token corpus in French spanning multiple high-quality sources like literature, transcripts, legal documents, etc.

2. Training of CroissantLLM, an intrinsically bilingual 1.3B parameter language model with equal amounts of English and French data in its 3 trillion token training corpus. This is done to reduce bias towards English and study multilingualism.

3. Creation of FrenchBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate language model capabilities in French across various tasks like reading comprehension, knowledge, biases, generation, etc.

4. Release of inference-optimal CroissantLLM models up to 1.3B parameters aimed at industrial usage, along with smaller model sizes, checkpoints, training datasets, etc. for the research community. The models are shown to be transparent - they comply with 81% of criteria in the Foundation Model Transparency Index.

In summary, the main contributions are around introducing new French resources, training a balanced English-French language model, and releasing models and datasets to advance research into multilingual models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions training a custom tokenizer on equal amounts of French, English, and code data. What were the main motivations behind this decision and what advantages does this custom tokenizer provide over using an existing one? 

2. The paper explores different mixing ratios of English and French data during pretraining. What methodology did the authors use to determine the optimal 1:1 mixing ratio and what were the key findings from their experiments varying the ratios?

3. The paper introduces a new French benchmark, FrenchBench, covering a diverse set of tasks. What were the authors' criteria and rationale for selecting the specific tasks included in FrenchBench? How does it improve upon existing French evaluation benchmarks?

4. The authors use "canaries" - intentionally corrupted samples - during pretraining. What is the purpose of including canaries and what insights did the authors gain about model memorization from this approach? 

5. The paper emphasizes training an "inference optimal" model by pretraining extensively past the point of diminishing returns on perplexity. What evidence indicates that downstream task performance continues improving with longer pretraining, and why is this result interesting?

6. What modifications or additions were made to the Megatron-DeepSpeed framework for the pretraining implementation? What efficiency optimizations were critical for making the large-scale pretraining feasible?

7. The paper introduces a "CroissantCool" variant. How does its continued pretraining on an instruction dataset impact performance relative to the base CroissantLLM model? What does this suggest about the effects of pretraining data?

8. How do the empirical results demonstrate the importance of pretraining data scale and multilinguality for acquiring cultural knowledge and overcoming bias towards English?

9. The paper conducts extensive experiments on finetuning, including for dialogue and translation tasks. What key findings emerge from these experiments regarding the transferability of the CroissantLLM base model?

10. The authors evaluate model transparency using the FMTI framework. What are 1-2 areas where CroissantLLM meets and falls short of full transparency, and why might improvements be challenging?
