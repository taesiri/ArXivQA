# [Large language models for crowd decision making based on prompt design   strategies using ChatGPT: models, analysis and challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15587)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into Crowd Decision Making (CDM) processes to leverage the wisdom of crowds from social media opinions expressed as free natural language texts. CDM refers to decision making models that analyze the sentiments in texts to help people make decisions. However, extracting meaningful evaluations from natural language texts is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes using ChatGPT's ability to understand language semantics to extract evaluations representing the sentiment polarity, numerical scores, or linguistic terms from expert reviews. Five CDM scenarios using different ChatGPT prompt strategies are presented:

1. Extract sentiment polarity evaluations (positive/negative/neutral)  
2. Extract numerical score evaluations 
3. Extract linguistic term evaluations  
4. Multi-criteria decision making using a category ontology
5. ChatGPT as an end-to-end CDM system 

The paper also analyzes using ChatGPT for CDM on a real-world restaurant review dataset.

Main Contributions:

- Integrates ChatGPT into CDM models to leverage social media opinions for decision making
- Proposes five scenarios for extracting evaluations from texts using different ChatGPT prompt strategies 
- Empirically analyzes the feasibility of using ChatGPT for CDM on real-world restaurant reviews
- Discusses key challenges of using ChatGPT for CDM - consistency, sensitivity, explainability
- Opens up many future research directions on designing robust CDM models using LLMs

Overall, the paper demonstrates the promising potential of using LLMs like ChatGPT to develop quality decision making models that leverage the wisdom of crowds from social opinions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and analyzing the integration of large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, into crowd decision making (CDM) models to leverage the wisdom of crowds from social media opinions expressed in plain text reviews. 

The paper explores five different scenarios of using ChatGPT prompts to extract evaluations from expert reviews, including extracting primary polarities, numerical scores, linguistic term set scores, multi-criteria evaluations based on a category ontology, and using ChatGPT as an end-to-end CDM system. It conducts an empirical analysis on real review data to showcase the feasibility of the proposals. 

Additionally, the paper provides an in-depth discussion of key challenges that arise when using LLMs like ChatGPT for CDM, focusing on the consistency, sensitivity, and explainability issues. It outlines open questions to tackle in future research to develop more robust and trustworthy CDM systems enhanced by the natural language understanding capabilities of modern LLMs.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive analysis - both theoretical and empirical - regarding the integration of ChatGPT in CDM to infer evaluations from plain text reviews as well as a discussion of open issues to address in this emerging research direction.
