# [Large Language Models of Code Fail at Completing Code with Potential   Bugs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03438)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How do large language models of code (LLMs) perform on the task of buggy code completion, where the code context contains potential bugs?

The key hypothesis appears to be that the presence of potential bugs in the code context will significantly degrade the performance of LLMs on code completion. 

The authors define the novel problem of "buggy code completion" (bCC), where the model must complete unfinished code that contains potential bugs - code patterns that are likely to lead to bugs. They introduce two new datasets for systematically studying bCC with controlled and real-world potential bugs.

Through experiments on bCC using the latest LLMs like CodeGen and InCoder, the authors find that:

- The presence of even a single potential bug drastically reduces code completion performance, with test case pass rates dropping from 40-55% on clean code to below 5% on buggy code.

- The buggy code context essentially destroys the benefits of providing partial code context, with pass rates being even worse than completing without any context.

- Attempted methods to make the LLMs bug-aware do improve performance but still remain far below completion on clean code.

So in summary, the central hypothesis that potential bugs will significantly degrade LLM performance on code completion is validated through the empirical results. The paper helps characterize and understand this previously unexplored problem setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is defining and systematically studying the novel problem of buggy-code completion (BCC). Specifically:

- The paper introduces and formulates the BCC problem, which is inspired by the practical scenario of using code completion with buggy code contexts. BCC involves generating functional code completions from contexts that contain potential bugs.

- The paper constructs two new datasets for evaluating BCC: BuggyHumanEval and BuggyFixEval. BuggyHumanEval contains synthetic bugs derived from semantic-altering edits to solutions. BuggyFixEval contains more realistic bugs derived from incorrect and correct user submissions. 

- The paper empirically evaluates the BCC performance of state-of-the-art code language models like CodeGen and InCoder. It finds that the models' performance significantly degrades in the presence of potential bugs compared to normal code completion.

- The paper investigates several post-hoc methods like removal, completion->rewriting, and rewriting->completion, for mitigating the negative effect of potential bugs. While these help, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to completion from clean contexts.

- The paper provides ablation studies and case analyses for better understanding model behaviors on BCC.

In summary, the key contribution is defining and conducting a systematic study of the new BCC problem to understand and improve code language models' robustness to potential bugs during code generation. The datasets, empirical results and analyses help establish BCC as an important open problem at the intersection of code generation and program repair.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces a new code completion task called buggy-code completion (BCC), where the goal is to complete partial code snippets that contain potential bugs. The key findings are that the presence of potential bugs significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art code completion models like CodeGen and InCoder, reducing test case pass rates from 40-55% on clean code to 0.5-4% on buggy code. The paper also explores some simple techniques like removing or rewriting the potential bugs before completion, which improve performance but still leave a large gap compared to completing clean code. Overall, the main takeaway is that existing language models struggle at adapting to and handling potential bugs during code completion.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related work:

- It focuses on the novel problem of code completion in the presence of potential bugs in the context code. Most prior work on code completion assumes clean/bug-free context code. Studying code completion with potential bugs is an interesting and practically relevant extension.

- The paper introduces two new datasets, HumanEval-Buggy and FixEval-Buggy, to systematically study this problem. These are among the first datasets designed specifically for evaluating code completion with potential bugs. Prior datasets like HumanEval and FixEval did not have this focus.

- The experiments reveal that existing state-of-the-art code language models like CodeGen and InCoder struggle significantly at completing code snippets with potential bugs. Their performance degrades drastically compared to completing clean code snippets. This is an important finding given the popularity of these models. 

- The authors test some simple augmentation methods like removing, rewriting, or repairing the potential bugs before completion. While these help, there is still a substantial performance gap compared to completion with clean code. Developing more robust methods for handling potential bugs remains an open challenge.

- The scope is focused on studying the behavior of existing code LMs on this new buggy code completion task, compared to prior work that often proposes new models/training methods. The analysis helps understand limitations of current models.

Overall, the paper makes a nice contribution in identifying and formalizing the novel problem setting of code completion with potential bugs. The datasets, experiments and analysis help reveal and quantify the challenges faced by existing state-of-the-art code LMs in this practical setting. The results also motivate the need for more research into making code completion robust to potential bugs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing new methods and models specifically for buggy-code completion. The authors show that existing code completion models struggle on this task, so developing specialized techniques could lead to better performance. Some ideas include training on buggy code examples, integrating bug detection components, or designing models with built-in robustness to potential bugs.

- Studying how to balance buggy-code completion performance with conventional code completion performance. As shown in the paper, methods that help for buggy completion can sometimes hurt on clean code. Adaptively switching between methods based on detected bugs is one approach proposed. 

- Evaluating the methods on a wider range of models and datasets. The authors demonstrate consistent findings across different model sizes and architectures, but evaluating on an even broader set of models can further validate the conclusions. Expanding the diversity and scale of datasets could also be beneficial.

- Testing the methods in real programming environments and workflows. While the paper studies the core technical problem, evaluating the real-world impact when integrated into IDEs and used by developers remains an open question.

- Investigating interactions between buggy-code completion and other code intelligence tasks like bug detection, repair, and translation. The paper proposes some ways these tasks could be combined, but more exploration of joint modeling is needed.

- Developing better methods for generating synthetic but realistic bugs for evaluation and training. The datasets constructed for this paper are limited by how bugs are synthesized. More natural bug simulation could improve research in this area.

- Understanding mistakes made by language models on buggy inputs to inform future model designs. The authors provide some analysis but deeper investigation into the failure modes can uncover limitations to address.

Overall, the paper proposes buggy-code completion as a new problem setting and performs an initial investigation. But significantly more research is needed to make these models truly viable and robust for real-world usage. The authors provide several interesting directions to guide this future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the task of buggy-code completion, which involves completing partial code snippets that contain potential bugs. The authors argue that existing code completion benchmarks ignore the presence of bugs, which are common during software development. To systematically study buggy-code completion, the authors introduce two new datasets - BuggyHumanEval and BuggyFixEval. BuggyHumanEval contains coding problems from HumanEval with bugs synthetically introduced through semantic-altering operator changes. BuggyFixEval contains more realistic bugs derived from accepted and rejected competitive programming submissions. 

The authors find that the presence of potential bugs significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art code completion models like CodeGen and InCoder. For instance, on BuggyHumanEval, the test case pass rate of CodeGen-2B drops from 54.9% on clean code to just 3.1% on code with potential bugs. The authors test several methods to mitigate the effect of bugs, like removing or rewriting the buggy partial code before completion. While these help, there remains a substantial performance gap compared to completing clean code. The paper provides a systematic study of how code completion models perform in the presence of potential bugs, highlighting a major limitation of existing models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces and studies the novel task of buggy-code completion (bCC), where the goal is to generate functional code implementations from natural language descriptions and buggy code snippets as context. To systematically study bCC, the authors construct two new datasets - buggyHumanEval and buggyFixEval. buggyHumanEval contains coding problems from HumanEval with synthetic bugs introduced through semantic-altering code edits. buggyFixEval contains more realistic bugs derived from incorrect and correct user submissions to programming problems. Using these datasets, the authors evaluate several state-of-the-art code language models on bCC and find significant performance degradation compared to conventional code completion without bugs. They further explore augmenting the language models with external program repair modules and find that while this helps mitigate the negative impact of bugs, there remains a substantial gap compared to completion performance on non-buggy code. The paper provides an in-depth analysis and case studies to elucidate model behaviors and failure modes on the challenging bCC task.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper introduces and studies the novel problem of "buggy-code completion" (bCC), which involves generating complete code from a partial code snippet that contains potential bugs. 

- This is motivated by practical scenarios where code suggestion models may need to handle imperfect code contexts with bugs/mistakes. Prior work on code completion assumes clean code contexts.

- The authors construct two new datasets for systematically evaluating bCC:
    - BuggyHumanEval: Based on HumanEval, with artificial single-operator bugs introduced into solutions.
    - BuggyFixEval: Based on FixEval, contains more realistic bugs sourced from incorrect user submissions.

- Experiments show that the presence of potential bugs significantly degrades performance of state-of-the-art code completion models like CodeGen and InCoder.

- The authors test several methods to mitigate the effects of bugs, like removing buggy code, completing then rewriting, or rewriting then completing. These improve performance but still substantially underperform completion on clean code.

- There is detailed ablation and case studies analyzing model behavior and failure modes in bCC.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying and formalizing the novel bCC problem, constructing representative datasets, and systematically evaluating state-of-the-art code completion models, revealing their inability to handle potential bugs. The paper makes a strong case that handling imperfect code contexts merits further research.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces and studies the novel task of buggy-code completion, where the goal is to generate functionally correct code completions from contexts that contain potential bugs. The authors construct two new datasets for this task - BuggyHumanEval based on synthetically introducing bugs through operator changes, and BuggyFixEval based on rejected and accepted submissions to programming problems. Experiments demonstrate that the presence of potential bugs severely degrades the performance of state-of-the-art code completion models like CodeGen and InCoder, with test pass rates dropping from 50-55% on clean contexts to below 5% on buggy contexts across both datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces two new datasets, \buggyHumanEval and \buggyFixEval, to evaluate the task of buggy-code completion. What are the key differences between these datasets and why were both necessary to properly evaluate the task? What are the relative pros and cons of each dataset?

2. The paper proposes and evaluates several "bug-aware" methods to try to mitigate the negative effects of potential bugs on code completion, including removal -> completion, completion -> rewriting, and rewriting -> completion. Why do you think each of these methods performs differently on the two datasets? What might this suggest about the nature and distribution of bugs in each dataset? 

3. The rewriting -> completion method uses likelihood-based measures to try to identify potential bug lines for rewriting. The paper experiments with both maximum and average likelihood aggregation. Why might one work better than the other depending on the dataset? What might this suggest about the types of bugs in each dataset?

4. For the completion -> rewriting method, the paper uses the RealiT model for rewriting/repairing completed programs. What properties of RealiT make it suitable for this task compared to other program repair models? How could RealiT potentially be improved or modified to work even better in this pipeline?

5. The results show that while the proposed methods improve performance over naive completion, there are still substantial gaps compared to completion on clean code. What factors might contribute to these lingering performance gaps? How could the methods be enhanced to further close these gaps?

6. The paper provides some analysis of how performance varies based on the location of the potential bug and the length of the partial code prefix. What were the key findings here and why do you think certain trends were observed? What might this suggest about how to design better methods?

7. Based on the case studies and examples provided in the paper, what seem to be the key limitations or failure modes of the tested models on buggy code completion? How could models be improved to address these issues?

8. The potential bugs in the datasets are defined relative to specific completed programs. How does this definition of "potential bug" differ from how bugs are traditionally defined? What are the tradeoffs of this approach?

9. The task of buggy code completion is motivated by mimicking real-time code suggestion in IDEs with potentially buggy code. Do you think the datasets and evaluation approach effectively capture this practical use case? What aspects could be improved or changed?
