# [Designing Trustful Cooperation Ecosystems is Key to the New Space   Exploration Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06036)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The emerging space economy relies on autonomous robotic missions for mapping, mining, etc. Agencies and companies are investing in this, with goals around in situ resource utilization (ISRU).
- Managing competing economic interests of stakeholders to cooperate within a proprietary ecosystem is challenging. A transparent, reliable, non-proprietary digital platform could help coordinate and trade services to explore space resources.
- Blockchains have limitations - increased energy use, low throughput, full transparency. So there is a need to weigh economic benefits against technical drawbacks of using blockchain in multi-robot systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Use blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) to create a trustworthy cross-organizational platform for efficient coordination of multi-robot systems in space.
- Enable a mesh network for robots to communicate and coordinate tasks via market-based interactions. Ensure transparency for a "coopetitive" environment. 
- Make the system robot-agnostic and scalable. Implement safeguards for data integrity and accessibility.

Contributions:
- Advances the discussion on using DLT economic benefits vs. technical challenges in multi-robot systems for space exploration.
- Presents a DLT-driven heterogeneous multi-robot system for map exploration, focused on an ESA Space Resource Challenge scenario.
- Details a research plan for integrating DLT and market-based coordination of robot systems, including network, transparency, robot-agnostic and data loss resistant requirements.
- Identifies 5 key open research problems - autonomy, cost functions, energy use, alternatives, and AI agents.
- Calls for interdisciplinary efforts encompassing legal, regulatory, engineering, organizational and economic aspects.

The paper stimulates further research by laying groundwork and inviting critiques and extensions of the proposed DLT and multi-robot systems framework.
