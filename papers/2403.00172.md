# [Go Beyond Black-box Policies: Rethinking the Design of Learning Agent   for Interpretable and Verifiable HVAC Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) methods for HVAC control use black-box models and stochastic optimizers, lacking reliability guarantees and posing risks to occupant health. Specifically, they exhibit significant stochasticity in their setpoint decisions.

Proposed Solution:
- Redesign HVAC controllers by extracting deterministic and interpretable decision tree (DT) policies from existing thermal dynamics models and historical data.
- Introduce a novel domain-specific verification criterion for HVAC controllers to ensure safety.
- Develop a 2-stage procedure to extract the DT policy using the learned black-box dynamics model:
   1) Generate a decision dataset by distilling the stochastic decisions of the MBRL controller into deterministic decisions based on the most frequent action. Address high dimensionality through importance sampling conditioned on historical data distributions.
   2) Construct the DT policy using the CART algorithm on the decision dataset.
- Present an offline verification algorithm with 2 components:
   1) Formal verification algorithm that traverses all paths of the DT and checks compliance to safety criteria. Failures are corrected by editing the DT.
   2) Probabilistic verification using Monte Carlo sampling to estimate probability of failure.

Main Contributions:
- Address the critical reliability challenge in HVAC control by introducing a verification criterion tailored to HVAC systems.
- Extract interpretable and verifiable DT policies that significantly outperform current MBRL methods in building control performance.
- Develop innovative techniques to enable efficient policy extraction given high input dimensionality.
- Introduce an offline verification algorithm that provides formal guarantees on policy safety before deployment.
- Demonstrated up to 68.4% more energy savings and 14.8% increase in comfort compared to state-of-the-art, with 1127x lower computation overhead.
