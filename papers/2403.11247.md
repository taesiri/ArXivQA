# [Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting For Dense Visual SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing Gaussian splatting (GS)-based SLAM systems suffer from high memory usage and slow training speed due to maintaining a large number of redundant 3D Gaussian ellipsoids to represent the scene. This limits their practical deployment, especially on resource-constrained devices.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a compact GS-based SLAM system that significantly enhances storage efficiency while delivering high reconstruction quality, fast training speed and real-time rendering. The key ideas are:

1) Sliding window-based online masking to remove redundant Gaussians. A learnable mask is introduced to eliminate Gaussians based on volume and opacity. Additional strategies like frustum culling and sliding window reset further improve compactness.  

2) Geometry codebook to compress Gaussian geometry attributes. Based on the observation that most Gaussians have similar geometries, a residual vector quantization method is used to compress scale and rotation into a codebook. Only the codebook indices are stored.

3) Global bundle adjustment with reprojection loss for accurate camera tracking. A keyframe-based global BA approach with reprojection loss is used for robust and accurate pose estimation.

Main Contributions:

- Novel compact GS scene representation that achieves 1.97x compression in Gaussian count and 2x memory savings while maintaining state-of-the-art image quality

- Sliding window masking technique to incrementally remove redundant Gaussians tailored for online SLAM systems

- Geometry codebook method that exploits geometric similarity of Gaussians to enable compression

- Global BA with reprojection loss for accurate and robust camera tracking

- Significantly faster training speed and real-time rendering capability compared to prior GS-based SLAM works

The proposed compact GS-SLAM system enables high-quality reconstruction and camera tracking while being efficient in memory, storage and speed. Extensive experiments validate the advantages over previous GS and NeRF-based SLAM techniques.
