# [Verb Categorisation for Hindi Word Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11395)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Word problem solving is an important and challenging NLP task where the goal is to solve math word problems described in natural language text. 
- Recent work has focused on developing solvers for Indian languages. 
- Verbs play a vital role in identifying operations for addition/subtraction word problems. However, there is no verb categorization data available for Hindi.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a rule-based word problem solver that uses verb categorization to identify operations.
- The key ideas are:
   - Define 5 verb categories - observation, positive, negative, positive transfer, negative transfer
   - Create a dataset by annotating verbs from addition/subtraction word problems
   - Explore 3 approaches for verb categorization - nearest neighbors, statistical ML models, and contextual embeddings using MuRIL
   - Design a rule-based solver that uses identified verb categories to determine operations

Main Contributions:
- Create verb categorization dataset for Hindi with 5 categories
- Provide comparative analysis of different verb categorization approaches (MuRIL works best with 0.96 F1) 
- Introduce a rule-based solver that uses verb categories to identify operations
- Demonstrate solver on test set with accuracy comparable to prior work
- The approach is intuitive, explainable and can serve as a teaching aid

Future Work:
- Improve solver accuracy and range (addition/subtraction only currently)
- Handle word problems with multiplication and division operations

In summary, the paper makes verb categorization data available for Hindi, provides analysis of different modeling approaches, and demonstrates an explainable rule-based solver that relies on verb semantics to solve mathematical word problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces verb categorization for Hindi to identify mathematical operations in word problems, proposes three verb classification approaches with MuRIL fine-tuning performing the best, and presents a rule-based word problem solver using verb categories that achieves comparable accuracy to prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Redefining verb categories for word problem solving in Hindi. The authors have proposed 5 verb categories - Observation, Positive, Negative, Positive Transfer, and Negative Transfer.

2. Creating a new verb categorization dataset for Hindi by annotating verbs from Hindi arithmetic word problems. Around 200 unique verbs were annotated into the 5 proposed categories.

3. Introducing and comparing three new verb categorization approaches - Verb Distance, Statistical Models, and Contextual Embeddings using MuRIL. The contextual embedding approach using MuRIL gave the best performance with an F1-score of 0.962.

4. Proposing a rule-based solver that uses the verb categories to identify mathematical operations and solve addition/subtraction word problems in Hindi. The solver achieved an accuracy comparable to prior work.

In summary, the key contributions are: redefining verb categories, creating a dataset, proposing and evaluating verb categorization approaches, and developing a rule-based word problem solver that uses verb categories to solve problems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and contents, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Hindi arithmetic word problem solving
- Verb categorization for Hindi
- Rule-based solver for word problems
- Verb categories like observation, positive, negative, positive transfer, negative transfer 
- Approaches for verb categorization - verb distance, statistical models like logistic regression and SVM, contextual embeddings using MuRIL
- Identifying entities, containers, quantities in word problems
- Using verbs to identify mathematical operations
- Comparative analysis of verb categorization approaches
- Limitations of verb categorization for multiplication/division problems
- Errors made by rule-based solver

The paper focuses on using verb categorization to identify mathematical operations needed to solve simple addition and subtraction word problems in Hindi. It provides a comparative analysis of different approaches for verb categorization and presents a rule-based solver that utilizes verb categories to solve word problems. Some key limitations and errors are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces 5 verb categories - Observation, Positive, Negative, Positive Transfer and Negative Transfer. Why are these specific categories useful for solving addition/subtraction word problems? Could additional categories like Construct and Destroy (as used by Hosseini et al.) also be relevant?

2. The inter-annotator agreement score using Fleiss' Kappa is 0.89. What does this score signify? What could be some reasons for disagreement between annotators, especially between the Observation and Positive categories? 

3. For statistical models, a context window of size 7 is used for creating samples. What is the intuition behind using the neighboring words in a fixed-size window? Would a larger or smaller window size impact model performance?

4. The MuRIL contextual embedding model achieves the best F1 score of 0.962. What specific advantages do contextualized embeddings provide over static word embeddings in a text classification task such as verb categorization?

5. The rule-based solver has an accuracy of 41.2%. Analyze some of the common failure cases - irrelevant information, errors in entity identification etc. What modifications could make the solver robust to these issues?

6. How effective is the circumscription assumption in rule 5 for quantity association? In what cases might this assumption fail and lead to incorrect state creation? 

7. Rules for identifying entities rely heavily on noun and adjectives. However, pronouns are also frequently used. How can coreference resolution help in linking pronouns to entities?

8. The current solver only attempts addition/subtraction word problems. What additional verb categories and rules would be needed to extend it to handle multiplication and division problems?

9. Error analysis in Table 5 highlights issues with the dependency parser used. How can an ensemble of parsers help improve stability and coverage?

10. The paper creates a domain-specific verb annotation dataset for Hindi. How can leveraging existing verb resources such as VerbNet help reduce annotation effort? Are domain adaptations of such lexical resources required?
