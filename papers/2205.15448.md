# [FeatER: An Efficient Network for Human Reconstruction via Feature   Map-Based TransformER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we design an efficient transformer architecture that preserves spatial feature map structure for human pose estimation (HPE) and human mesh reconstruction (HMR) tasks?

The key points are:

- Existing transformer architectures for vision flatten feature maps, losing important spatial structure. This is less than ideal for HPE and HMR tasks where spatial context is critical.

- Current state-of-the-art HPE and HMR methods achieve high accuracy but with very high computational/memory costs, making them impractical for real applications. 

- The authors propose a novel Feature Map-based Transformer (FeatER) that can effectively process feature maps while reducing complexity compared to standard transformers.

- FeatER is evaluated on 2D HPE, 3D HPE and HMR tasks, consistently improving efficiency and accuracy over previous methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a feature map-based transformer design can achieve state-of-the-art efficiency and performance for human pose and mesh estimation problems. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of FeatER for these tasks.
