# [FeatER: An Efficient Network for Human Reconstruction via Feature   Map-Based TransformER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15448)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we design an efficient transformer architecture that preserves spatial feature map structure for human pose estimation (HPE) and human mesh reconstruction (HMR) tasks?

The key points are:

- Existing transformer architectures for vision flatten feature maps, losing important spatial structure. This is less than ideal for HPE and HMR tasks where spatial context is critical.

- Current state-of-the-art HPE and HMR methods achieve high accuracy but with very high computational/memory costs, making them impractical for real applications. 

- The authors propose a novel Feature Map-based Transformer (FeatER) that can effectively process feature maps while reducing complexity compared to standard transformers.

- FeatER is evaluated on 2D HPE, 3D HPE and HMR tasks, consistently improving efficiency and accuracy over previous methods.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a feature map-based transformer design can achieve state-of-the-art efficiency and performance for human pose and mesh estimation problems. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness of FeatER for these tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel transformer architecture called FeatER (Feature map-based TransformER) for human pose estimation (HPE) and human mesh reconstruction (HMR) tasks. 

- FeatER preserves the feature map representation when modeling self-attention in the transformer, which is more natural for HPE and HMR tasks that rely on keypoint heatmap predictions.

- FeatER performs dimensional decomposition along the height and width of feature maps to significantly reduce computational complexity compared to standard transformers.

- An efficient framework is presented using FeatER blocks for both 2D and 3D tasks. A feature map reconstruction module is introduced to improve robustness.

- Extensive experiments show FeatER outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 2D HPE, 3D HPE, and HMR with 5-16x lower computational cost and memory usage.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the FeatER transformer that can effectively process feature maps while being highly efficient, enabling strong performance on human pose and mesh estimation tasks. The efficiency of FeatER compared to other transformers is a notable advantage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes FeatER, a novel efficient transformer architecture that operates directly on feature maps to capture spatial context for human pose estimation and mesh reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing computational cost.
