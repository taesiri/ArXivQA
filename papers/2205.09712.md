# [Selection-Inference: Exploiting Large Language Models for Interpretable   Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09712)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can large language models be adapted to perform better at multi-step logical reasoning and generate interpretable, causal reasoning traces?The key points are:- Large language models (LLMs) perform well at certain natural language tasks but struggle at multi-step logical reasoning. - The authors propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework to address this. The SI framework breaks down reasoning into modular selection and inference steps.- This modular approach produces a causal, interpretable reasoning trace showing how the model reached its conclusion. - The causal trace has benefits for model interpretability, debugging, and trustworthiness.- The authors show the SI framework allows a 7B parameter LLM to significantly outperform larger 280B LLMs at logical reasoning when used naively.- With the SI framework, the 7B LLM solves tasks requiring up to 5 reasoning steps with high accuracy from only 5 examples.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that breaking reasoning into selection and inference modules will allow LLMs to perform better logical reasoning and generate causal, interpretable traces. The results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the key contributions of this paper:- They provide a comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on a suite of 50 logical reasoning tasks. They show that LLMs perform well on simple entailment and single-step reasoning, but struggle on harder multi-step reasoning problems. - They propose a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that breaks down reasoning into modular selection and inference steps. This is inspired by neurosymbolic methods. The key idea is to alternate between selecting relevant facts and making inferences based on those facts.- They demonstrate the SI framework using a 7B parameter LLM on 10 reasoning tasks. Without any fine-tuning, it improves accuracy by over 100% compared to an equivalent LLM baseline. The 7B SI model even outperforms a much larger 280B LLM baseline.- The SI framework produces causal, interpretable reasoning traces that justify its answers step-by-step. This enables debugging and auditing of the system's reasoning, which has implications for trust and safety.- They show the SI framework can be further improved by fine-tuning the selection and inference modules, achieving 78.95% accuracy on the ProofWriter benchmarks.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a new neurosymbolic framework that significantly improves logical reasoning abilities of LLMs while also producing interpretable causal reasoning traces. The modular structure enables generalization to complex multi-step reasoning problems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents a Selection-Inference (SI) framework that improves the ability of large language models to perform multi-step logical reasoning by separating the reasoning process into modular selection and inference steps. The SI framework allows large language models to achieve significant performance gains on logical reasoning benchmarks compared to vanilla baselines, while also producing interpretable, causal reasoning traces.The key summary sentence is:The paper introduces a Selection-Inference framework that decomposes logical reasoning into interpretable causal steps and substantially improves the reasoning ability of large language models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper on the Selection-Inference framework compares to other related research on improving logical reasoning abilities of large language models:- Uses a modular, neurosymbolic-inspired approach of alternating between selection and inference steps. This is different from end-to-end fine-tuning LLMs, and separates it from methods that generate the full reasoning trace in one pass.- Focuses on producing causal, interpretable reasoning traces. The reasoning trace directly depends on and explains the model's answers. This contrasts with post-hoc rationalization methods where the explanation can be wrong while the answer is right.- Evaluates comprehensively on a large set of reasoning tasks. Many previous works evaluate on 1-2 reasoning datasets. This paper tests on 11 diverse reasoning tasks.- Shows strong results by combining prompt engineering with pre-trained models. Gets over 2x gain over baselines without requiring task-specific fine-tuning data.- Further improves results through task-specific fine-tuning. Shows benefits of modular fine-tuning versus end-to-end.- Uses large pre-trained LLMs like Gopher as reasoning modules. Prior neurosymbolic-inspired works often use more brittle, hand-designed modules.Overall, this work pushes the state-of-the-art in getting large pre-trained LLMs to do robust, interpretable logical reasoning. The modular design and focus on causal reasoning traces differentiates this approach from prior methods. The comprehensive benchmarking and gains without fine-tuning also demonstrate the effectiveness of the Selection-Inference framework.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving the Selection module, for example by allowing the model to search over and evaluate different reasoning traces rather than just selecting facts greedily.- Addressing the halting issue, both in terms of when to stop the Selection module and when to terminate the overall reasoning process.- Incorporating verifiers or validators that would check the validity of each reasoning step before adding it to the context, helping to avoid false inferences.- Enabling the system to source its own relevant context rather than relying on context being provided in the dataset, for example by retrieving facts from knowledge bases.- Extending the system's capabilities to deal with ambiguous, undefined or unanswerable questions.- Evaluating the approach on more complex real-world reasoning tasks in domains like science, law, medicine etc. where logical reasoning is important.- Combining the approach with recent methods that allow models to search the internet for relevant facts.- Developing better methods for deciding when to halt the reasoning trace and filter out unnecessary steps.So in summary, the main directions are developing more robust reasoning capabilities, scaling to less structured real-world domains, integrating external knowledge retrieval, and improving trace filtering and halting mechanisms. The authors lay out an exciting research agenda for developing more capable and trustworthy reasoning systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a Selection-Inference (SI) framework to improve the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step logical reasoning. The authors first evaluate LLMs on a comprehensive set of 50 logical reasoning tasks and find they perform well on simple inference but struggle with multi-step reasoning. The SI framework breaks down reasoning into modular selection and inference steps. Selection chooses relevant facts from the context to support one reasoning step. Inference uses that selection to deduce a new fact, which is added to the context. This process repeats to build up an interpretable, causal reasoning trace. Experiments on 10 tasks show a 7B parameter LLM in the SI framework improves over 100% vs vanilla baselines and even outperforms a 280B baseline. Fine-tuning further boosts performance. A key benefit is the causal reasoning trace, which is useful for model debugging, safety, and trust. Overall, the SI framework significantly improves logical reasoning in LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a Selection-Inference (SI) framework to improve the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform logical reasoning. The authors first evaluate LLMs on a comprehensive set of 50 logical reasoning tasks and find that while LLMs perform well on simple single-step inference problems, they struggle with more complex multi-step reasoning. To address this, the paper introduces the SI framework which breaks down reasoning into two modular stages - selection, which chooses relevant facts from the context, and inference, which uses those facts to make a new logical deduction. The SI framework is evaluated on a subset of 10 reasoning tasks. Using a 7 billion parameter LLM with no fine-tuning, the SI framework achieves over 100% improvement compared to an equivalent LLM baseline on these tasks. The SI model even outperforms a much larger 280 billion parameter LLM baseline. Additionally, the SI framework produces causal, interpretable reasoning traces that justify its answers step-by-step. This has advantages for model transparency, debugging, and human oversight. Overall, the proposed SI framework significantly improves logical reasoning abilities of LLMs while also producing more trustworthy explanations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a Selection-Inference (SI) framework to improve the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform logical reasoning. The key idea is to break down reasoning into two modular stages: 1) Selection: This involves selecting the most relevant facts from a context to support a single reasoning step. The selection module is implemented by scoring each fact in the context using the LLM and picking the one with highest likelihood.2) Inference: This takes the limited selection from the previous stage as input and uses it to infer a new fact or rule, which is then added back to the context. The inference module is also implemented with an LLM. By chaining together multiple steps of selection and inference, the model can iteratively build up a reasoning trace leading to the final answer. Compared to standard LLM baselines, the authors show this framework significantly boosts performance on logical reasoning datasets, while also producing interpretable reasoning chains. Fine-tuning the selection and inference modules further improves results. Overall, the modular SI framework helps address limitations of LLMs on compositional reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue that large language models (LLMs) tend to struggle with multi-step logical reasoning, even though they have shown impressive capabilities as few-shot learners. The authors propose a "Selection-Inference" (SI) framework to improve the ability of LLMs to perform logically valid reasoning. The key points are:- LLMs are evaluated on a comprehensive set of 50 logical reasoning tasks. It is shown they do well on simpler single-step inference/entailment but struggle with multi-step reasoning.- The proposed SI framework breaks down reasoning into two modular stages - selection and inference. This is inspired by neurosymbolic AI approaches. - Selection involves choosing relevant information from the context to support one step of reasoning. Inference uses this selected information to deduce a new fact. - By chaining multiple selection and inference steps, the model can solve multi-step reasoning problems.- Using a 7B parameter LLM in this framework substantially improves performance on 10 logical reasoning tasks compared to equivalent LLM baselines.- The SI framework produces a causal, interpretable reasoning trace that shows each step taken to reach the final answer. This is useful for transparency and trust.In summary, the paper introduces a novel framework to improve logical reasoning abilities of LLMs in an interpretable manner. The modular structure also makes multi-step reasoning more tractable.
