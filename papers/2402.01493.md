# [Sliced-Wasserstein Estimation with Spherical Harmonics as Control   Variates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on efficiently estimating the Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance between probability distributions. The SW distance relies on projections of the distributions along random directions on the sphere, and integrating the Wasserstein distance between the 1D projections. The estimation involves two types of errors: (1) statistical error due to approximating the distributions with samples, and (2) integration error due to Monte Carlo approximation over the sphere. The goal is to reduce the integration error and variance of the Monte Carlo estimate.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new approach called Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV). The key ideas are:

(1) Express the SW integrand using spherical harmonics, which form an orthogonal basis for square-integrable functions on the sphere. This allows for an $L_2$ approximation of the integrand. 

(2) Use the spherical harmonics functions directly as control variates in a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo integration. Specifically, an Ordinary Least Squares Monte Carlo method (OLSMC) is used to find the best linear combination of control variates that minimizes the variance.

(3) Allow the number of spherical harmonics control variates to grow with number of Monte Carlo samples. This makes the residual variance of the integrand's approximation go to zero, achieving faster convergence.

Main Contributions:

- A novel SHCV estimator for SW distance using spherical harmonics control variates.

- Faster convergence rates for SHCV integration error compared to standard MC: $O(n^{-3/4+\epsilon})$ vs $O(n^{-1/2})$ for dimension 3.

- Rigorous analysis of integration error and Lipschitz properties of SW integrand to obtain guarantees. 

- Empirical evaluation showing superior performance compared to other control variate approaches for SW computation. Over 100x variance reduction on synthetic and real 3D point cloud data.

- Compatible with multiple integrals, providing significant speedups for SW-based kernel methods.

To summarize, the paper provides a principled approach leveraging spherical harmonics to obtain substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency for estimating Sliced-Wasserstein distances. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed SHCV method.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called "Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV)" for estimating the Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance between probability distributions. Specifically:

- The paper proposes to use spherical harmonics, which are polynomials on the sphere, as control variates to reduce the variance of the Monte Carlo estimate of the SW distance. This leads to the SHCV method.

- The SHCV method is shown to have several nice theoretical properties. In particular, it can integrate certain polynomial integrands exactly and achieves an improved convergence rate compared to standard Monte Carlo under some conditions. 

- The paper provides a rigorous analysis of the convergence rate and probabilistic error bound for the SHCV estimator.

- Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate superior performance of SHCV over other methods like standard Monte Carlo, recent control variate approaches, and quasi-Monte Carlo methods for estimating the SW distance. The gains are especially significant for discrete distributions.

- The effectiveness of SHCV is also shown on a real machine learning application of building SVM classifiers with SW kernels for image data.

So in summary, the key contribution is a novel control variate-based estimator for the SW distance using spherical harmonics, with strong theoretical and empirical results demonstrating its advantages.

The paper proposes a new method called "Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV)" to reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimates of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance. It uses spherical harmonics, which form an orthogonal basis on the sphere, as control variates in a Monte Carlo scheme. Theoretical properties are analyzed, including an exact integration result for certain cases and an improved convergence rate compared to standard Monte Carlo. Numerically, the SHCV method outperforms other methods on tasks involving multivariate Gaussians and 3D point clouds. An application to kernel SVMs for image classification is also demonstrated. So the key ideas focus on Sliced-Wasserstein distance approximation, control variates, spherical harmonics, and convergence guarantees.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper establishes a convergence rate of $O(L^{-1}n^{-1/2})$ for the SHCV integration error. Can you derive a similar convergence rate for the case when the measures have bounded support instead of finite moments? How does the convergence rate change compared to the current result?

2. In the Gaussian case with proportional covariance matrices, SHCV achieves exact integration. Can you characterize a broader class of measure pairs where exact integration is guaranteed? For example, what conditions need to be imposed on two non-Gaussian measures? 

3. The paper relies on the Lipschitz property of the SW integrand to derive the convergence rate. If higher order smoothness assumptions are made instead, how much can the rate be improved? Can you derive the optimal rates in this smooth setting?

4. The performance of SHCV seems tightly connected to how well spherical harmonics can approximate the integrand. Can you derive approximation error bounds for broader function classes, such as HÃ¶lder or Sobolev spaces? 

5. Instead of using all spherical harmonics up to a certain degree, can you design an adaptive scheme to select "important" harmonics? What theoretical guarantees can you provide for such a method?

6. How does the performance of SHCV degrade in high dimensions, in terms of approximation power and computational complexity? Can you modify the method to make it scalable?

7. The current analysis is for the uniform measure on the sphere. How can the method and theory be extended for more general probability measures? What class of measures would be most suitable?

8. For discrete measures, the SW integrand is only Lipschitz continuous. Can you exploit additional structure, such as the geometry of the point clouds, to obtain better guarantees?

9. The paper focuses on SW distances for simplicity. How can the SHCV principle be adopted to reduce the variance when estimating other OT distances such as Wasserstein?

10. In the Kernel SVM experiment, can you design an optimal strategy for allocating Monte Carlo samples between computing the SHCV weights and the integrand evaluations? How much gain can you get over the current heuristic?
