# [Sliced-Wasserstein Estimation with Spherical Harmonics as Control   Variates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on efficiently estimating the Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance between probability distributions. The SW distance relies on projections of the distributions along random directions on the sphere, and integrating the Wasserstein distance between the 1D projections. The estimation involves two types of errors: (1) statistical error due to approximating the distributions with samples, and (2) integration error due to Monte Carlo approximation over the sphere. The goal is to reduce the integration error and variance of the Monte Carlo estimate.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new approach called Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV). The key ideas are:

(1) Express the SW integrand using spherical harmonics, which form an orthogonal basis for square-integrable functions on the sphere. This allows for an $L_2$ approximation of the integrand. 

(2) Use the spherical harmonics functions directly as control variates in a variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo integration. Specifically, an Ordinary Least Squares Monte Carlo method (OLSMC) is used to find the best linear combination of control variates that minimizes the variance.

(3) Allow the number of spherical harmonics control variates to grow with number of Monte Carlo samples. This makes the residual variance of the integrand's approximation go to zero, achieving faster convergence.

Main Contributions:

- A novel SHCV estimator for SW distance using spherical harmonics control variates.

- Faster convergence rates for SHCV integration error compared to standard MC: $O(n^{-3/4+\epsilon})$ vs $O(n^{-1/2})$ for dimension 3.

- Rigorous analysis of integration error and Lipschitz properties of SW integrand to obtain guarantees. 

- Empirical evaluation showing superior performance compared to other control variate approaches for SW computation. Over 100x variance reduction on synthetic and real 3D point cloud data.

- Compatible with multiple integrals, providing significant speedups for SW-based kernel methods.

To summarize, the paper provides a principled approach leveraging spherical harmonics to obtain substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency for estimating Sliced-Wasserstein distances. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed SHCV method.
