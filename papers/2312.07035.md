# [HyperRouter: Towards Efficient Training and Inference of Sparse Mixture   of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07035)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel routing method called HyperRouter for training sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) models. HyperRouter employs a fixed hypernetwork to dynamically generate the parameters of the router during training based on a trainable router embedding. This balances between fully training the router, which causes representation collapse issues, and completely fixing the router parameters as in prior work like SMoE-Dropout, which restricts the model's representation capability. Experiments across various language modeling datasets demonstrate that HyperRouter outperforms strong SMoE baselines like Switch Transformer and SMoE-Dropout. Notably, HyperRouter achieves much better performance when using fewer experts during inference compared to alternatives, highlighting its improved parameter efficiency. For example, on the challenging WikiText-103 dataset, HyperRouter reduces perplexity from 560.93 to 65.17 compared to SMoE-Dropout when using just a single expert, while matching SMoE-Dropout's performance when allowed 8 experts. Thus, HyperRouter facilitates more efficient training and deployment of large language models using mixture-of-experts.
