# [Improved Image-based Pose Regressor Models for Underwater Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of visual localization for underwater vehicles during inspection missions around marine structures. Acoustic navigation is difficult in such areas due to shadowing and multipath. Inertial navigation accumulates errors over time and may not provide sufficient accuracy. Visual localization using cameras can provide a cost-effective, consistent and accurate alternative.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes using machine learning based pose regression models to estimate 6DOF pose from a single image. Two architectures are explored - one using a deep CNN feature extractor followed by affine regression, and another adding an LSTM layer in between for better feature processing. The models are trained to output position and orientation estimates by minimizing a weighted loss function.

Datasets:
The models are trained and tested on an underwater simulator dataset of a pipe inspection mission, as well as two separate datasets collected in a water tank using an ROV with different maneuvers. One tank set features mostly translation, while the other features rotation. 

Contributions:
1. Exploration of adding an LSTM layer for better exploitation of spatial context in images
2. Testing in underwater tank datasets with controlled conditions to benchmark accuracy
3. Showing that data augmentation using stereo camera improves results

Results:
The models achieve good accuracy on both simulated and real tank datasets. LSTM model performs the best overall. Tank dataset 1 with LSTM model achieves 0.034m, 0.79° accuracy. Data augmentation further improves this to 0.041m, 0.57°. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of using such methods for visual localization in real underwater scenarios.
