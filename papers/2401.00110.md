# [Diffusion Model with Perceptual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00110)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models trained with MSE loss generate unrealistic samples despite improvements in model architecture and training strategies.
- Classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance significantly improve sample quality but their effectiveness is not well understood. Classifier-free guidance also has limitations like sensitivity to hyperparameters.

- The paper argues that the effectiveness of classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance comes from them being implicit forms of perceptual guidance. MSE loss focuses too much on imperceptible pixel differences rather than perceptually important structural features. 

- Perceptual losses computed on features from a deep network better match human perception but have not been explored for diffusion model training before.

Method:
- The paper first observes that the diffusion model's training objective resembles that of a denoising autoencoder, making the model itself a good perceptual network. 

- A new self-perceptual (SP) training objective is proposed. The diffusion model is copied and frozen to serve as a perceptual network. During training, MSE loss is computed between features extracted by this network from real and predicted samples.

- The self-perceptual objective allows improving sample quality without relying on conditional input, maintaining diversity. It also works for unconditional generation unlike classifier-free guidance.

Results:
- Qualitative results show the self-perceptual model generates better quality samples than MSE while maintaining layout and diversity unlike classifier-free guidance.

- Quantitatively, the self-perceptual objective improves FID and IS but classifier-free guidance still achieves better metrics by enhancing text alignment.

- Ablations validate design choices like using midblock features, and show improvements on unconditional generation which was not possible before.

To summarize, the paper demonstrates that perceptual losses can directly improve diffusion model sample quality while overcoming limitations of classifier guidance methods. The proposed self-perceptual objective is a promising training strategy for diffusion models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-perceptual training objective for diffusion models that improves sample quality by using the diffusion model itself as a perceptual network to provide meaningful perceptual losses during training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel self-perceptual training objective for diffusion models. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance improve diffusion sample quality partly due to providing implicit perceptual guidance. 

2) The paper proposes using the diffusion model itself as a perceptual network to provide meaningful perceptual losses during training. This is done by freezing a diffusion model pretrained with MSE, then using its features on corrupted samples as supervision signal.

3) The self-perceptual training objective is shown qualitatively and quantitatively to improve sample quality over vanilla MSE training. It works for both conditional and unconditional diffusion models.

4) For conditional generation, the self-perceptual objective improves sample quality without sacrificing diversity, unlike classifier-free guidance. For unconditional generation, it enables quality improvement which was not possible with classifier-free guidance.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying perceptual guidance as the missing component in diffusion training, and proposing a self-perceptual objective that utilizes the diffusion model itself to provide perceptual supervision. This improves sample quality while overcoming limitations of existing techniques.

This allows improving sample quality for both unconditional and conditional generation, without sacrificing diversity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that diffusion models in their raw form generate unrealistic samples. What are the key reasons behind this observation? Discuss the distribution visualization in Figure 1 and model capacity limitations. 

2. The paper argues that classifier guidance works due to implicit perceptual guidance. Elaborate on this argument. How does a classifiers pre-trained perceptual abilities aid diffusion model sample quality?

3. Explain the argument that classifier-free guidance also relies on perceptual guidance from the model itself. How does the unconditional and conditional difference provide a meaningful gradient direction?

4. What are some key limitations of classifier-free guidance that motivates exploring direct perceptual losses? Discuss sensitivity issues and lack of support for unconditional models. 

5. Walk through the formulation of the proposed self-perceptual loss step-by-step. What is the intuition behind using the diffusion model itself as the perceptual network?

6. In the evaluation, it is shown that the self-perceptual loss improves sample quality but does not surpass classifier-free guidance. Provide reasons behind this observation.

7. The method supports unconditional image generation unlike classifier-free guidance. Elaborate on why this is the case and discuss the unconditionally generated samples. 

8. Ablation studies explore design choices like layer selection, timestep sampling, distance functions etc. Pick one and discuss the motivation and results in detail.  

9. The inference behavior visualization depicts interesting differences between MSE and self-perceptual models. Analyze the patterns and hypothesize reasons behind the observations.

10. While promising, the self-perceptual loss does not surpass classifier-free guidance in the end. Discuss limitations of the current formulation and propose ideas for further improvements.
