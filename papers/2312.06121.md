# [Can LLMs Configure Software Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06121)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the configuration of software tools and machine learning components. The complexity of selecting optimal configurations across high-dimensional search spaces is a key challenge, with manual trial-and-error methods being inefficient. The authors hypothesize that LLMs can leverage their understanding of context to suggest suitable starting conditions and narrow down search spaces to streamline configuration optimization. Through focused prompts imitating expert consultation, the authors query LLM responses for initializing hyperparameters of machine learning models in diverse use cases. Statistical analysis reveals intriguing insights - the high consistency of certain parameters potentially indicates cached default values, while variability across use cases displays context-aware adaptability. Comparative experiments highlight the effectiveness of LLM-suggested configurations over alternatives, achieving lower validation loss given limited epochs. However, assumptions of expertise and potential inaccuracies remain limitations. Overall, while preliminary, the findings reveal promise in utilizing LLMs to automate software tool configuration. More comprehensive investigations into the robustness and generalizability of the approach across more models, datasets and domains are warranted.
