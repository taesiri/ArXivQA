# [A Peg-in-hole Task Strategy for Holes in Concrete](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inserting anchor bolts into concrete holes (peg-in-hole task) is challenging for robots due to the high friction and variability in hole shapes of concrete. Existing analytical models, blind search, visual servoing and learning from demonstration methods have limitations dealing with concrete's properties.

Proposed Solution: 
- A data-driven peg-in-hole method using a deep neural network (DNN) trained with reinforcement learning to find the holes. 
- The method detaches the peg slightly from the wall when moving between search positions to avoid negative effects of concrete's high friction.
- Uses peg displacement toward the wall surface, in addition to force and torque, as input to the DNN since displacement increases as the peg gets closer to a chamfered hole in concrete.

Main Contributions:
- A hole-search strategy involving detaching the peg between discrete search positions to cope with concrete's high friction
- Adoption of a DNN trained with reinforcement learning to find holes with variable surface finish of concrete
- Improved generalization capability of the DNN by using peg displacement as additional input 
- Method can find holes without using peg position as input, allowing different hole positions to be generalized

Evaluations:
- Trained DNN on one hole and tested ability to find 12 unknown holes 
- Achieved 96.1% average success rate in finding unknown holes
- Average execution time of 12.5 seconds
- Additional tests showed trained DNN can generalize to different conditions like random initial positions and different peg type

Overall, the paper proposes a novel data-driven solution using deep reinforcement learning to enable robots to effectively accomplish peg-in-hole tasks in concrete even with its high friction and variability.
