# [EEVEE: An Easy Annotation Tool for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Eevee, a new annotation tool for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The key motivation is that existing annotation tools have several limitations: they use complex tool-specific data formats rather than simple token-level formats, require local installation and setup, have advanced features that slow down basic annotation, and are often task-specific rather than supporting multiple NLP tasks. 

To address these issues, Eevee is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. Key features include:

- Runs directly in the browser with no installation required
- Uses simple tab-separated token-level file formats
- Supports annotation for four core NLP task types: sequence labeling, span labeling, text classification, and sequence-to-sequence
- Provides an intuitive graphical interface with keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Allows configuring and annotating multiple tasks on a single dataset
- Exports data in a standardized format compatible with other NLP tools

The paper describes Eevee's setup page for configuring tasks and data, along with the annotation page and modes. A case study of named entity recognition annotation demonstrates high system usability based on standardized questionnaires. Comparisons to existing tools show Eevee is simpler to set up for token-level tasks and focuses on annotation speed.

In summary, Eevee is proposed as an easy-to-use and simplify annotation tool for multiple NLP task types. It aims to remove barriers to creating NLP datasets by running directly in browsers, using simple data formats, and providing an efficient annotation interface.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Eevee, a simple, efficient, and easy-to-use open-source annotation tool focused on tab-separated files that runs directly in the browser to facilitate annotation for common NLP tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of Eevee, a new annotation tool focused on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. Key aspects of Eevee highlighted in the paper include:

- It can run directly in the browser with no setup required, using tab-separated files instead of more complex formats. This allows for easy import/export and integration with common NLP tools.

- It supports annotation for multiple tasks (sequence labeling, span labeling, text classification, seq2seq) on the same dataset. 

- The interface is designed for efficiency, allowing keyboard-driven navigation and annotation.

- Compared to other tools, Eevee prioritizes a simple setup allowing novice users to quickly configure tasks and start annotating. The focus is on an intuitive, lightweight interface rather than more advanced but complex features.

- A system usability study showed Eevee received high scores for usability from annotators. Qualitative feedback also indicated annotators found it easy to learn and would prefer using it compared to previous tools.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and evaluation of Eevee as a new annotation tool focused on simplicity and usability in order to make dataset creation faster and easier.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Annotation tool
- Natural language processing (NLP) 
- Sequence labeling
- Span labeling  
- Text classification
- Sequence-to-sequence
- Usability
- Tab-separated files
- Token level
- Browser-based
- Minimalistic interface
- Keyboard shortcuts

The paper introduces an NLP annotation tool called "Eevee" that is focused on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. It highlights Eevee's browser-based interface, support for token-level annotation in tab-separated files, a minimalistic UI with keyboard shortcuts, and its applicability for common NLP annotation tasks like sequence labeling, span labeling, classification, and sequence-to-sequence. The paper also reports on a usability study of Eevee using the System Usability Scale. So the main keywords revolve around the annotation tool itself and its distinguishing user-interface and functionality characteristics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions difficulties with existing annotation tools as a motivation for Eevee. Can you elaborate on some specific issues encountered with tools like brat and doccano during annotation tasks?

2. The paper states that Eevee runs entirely in the browser. What are some advantages and potential drawbacks of this browser-based approach compared to installing annotation tools locally?  

3. Eevee uses tab-separated format for import and export. What are some pros and cons of this format choice instead of JSON or XML? How does it impact integration with other NLP pipelines?

4. The keyboard shortcuts and search functionalities seem central to Eevee's efficiency claims. Can you walk through how these features speed up the annotation process in practice? 

5. The paper introduces 4 task types supported in Eevee. Can you explain the key differences when annotating sequence labeling versus span labeling tasks? What about utterance classification? 

6. Configuration files are used to define tasks and labels in Eevee. What are some examples of parameters stored in these files? How do they facilitate reproducibility of annotation setups?

7. Can you walk through the process of setting up a new annotation project from scratch in Eevee? What are the key steps involved before the annotator can start labeling data?

8. The case study uses the System Usability Scale (SUS) to evaluate Eevee. Why was this scale selected over other usability methods? What are some pros and cons of using SUS?

9. The paper states Eevee does not employ active learning strategies. What are some potential upsides and downsides of this choice? How could active learning be integrated in future iterations? 

10. What types of annotation projects do you think Eevee is best suited for? What are some examples of tasks that might be difficult to configure properly in Eevee currently?
