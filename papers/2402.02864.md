# [EEVEE: An Easy Annotation Tool for Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Eevee, a new annotation tool for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The key motivation is that existing annotation tools have several limitations: they use complex tool-specific data formats rather than simple token-level formats, require local installation and setup, have advanced features that slow down basic annotation, and are often task-specific rather than supporting multiple NLP tasks. 

To address these issues, Eevee is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. Key features include:

- Runs directly in the browser with no installation required
- Uses simple tab-separated token-level file formats
- Supports annotation for four core NLP task types: sequence labeling, span labeling, text classification, and sequence-to-sequence
- Provides an intuitive graphical interface with keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
- Allows configuring and annotating multiple tasks on a single dataset
- Exports data in a standardized format compatible with other NLP tools

The paper describes Eevee's setup page for configuring tasks and data, along with the annotation page and modes. A case study of named entity recognition annotation demonstrates high system usability based on standardized questionnaires. Comparisons to existing tools show Eevee is simpler to set up for token-level tasks and focuses on annotation speed.

In summary, Eevee is proposed as an easy-to-use and simplify annotation tool for multiple NLP task types. It aims to remove barriers to creating NLP datasets by running directly in browsers, using simple data formats, and providing an efficient annotation interface.
