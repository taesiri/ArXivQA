# [Dense X Retrieval: What Retrieval Granularity Should We Use?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06648)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates using different granularities of text units - passages, sentences, and propositions - as retrieval units when indexing a corpus like Wikipedia for dense retrieval. The authors introduce the concept of a "proposition", defined as an atomic expression within text that encapsulates a distinct factoid and is presented in a concise, self-contained natural language format. They process an English Wikipedia dump into these three levels of granularity to create a dataset called FactoidWiki. Through experiments on multiple open-domain QA datasets, they find that retrieving by propositions, compared to passages or sentences, improves the performance of various dense retrievers. Specifically, proposition retrieval enhances generalization, with larger gains on queries about less common entities. It also improves downstream QA when using a retriever-reader pipeline with limited input length, owing to the higher density of question-relevant information. The gains highlight propositions as an effective retrieval unit, being compact yet also sufficiently contextualized. The authors propose proposition-level indexing of corpora as a simple but impactful strategy to boost dense retrievers at inference time.
