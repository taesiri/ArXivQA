# [Cost Aware Best Arm Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies a new multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem called Cost Aware Best Arm Identification (CABAI). In classic MAB, each arm has a reward distribution and the goal is to identify the arm with highest expected reward. CABAI differs in two ways: (1) each arm has an additional cost distribution, and (2) the goal is to identify the best reward arm while minimizing the total expected cost. This better captures real-world scenarios like clinical trials where there is a trade-off between cost of testing (e.g. drug prototypes) and rewards gained during deployment (efficacy). Existing bandit algorithms fail to account for this cost-reward tradeoff and heterogeneous costs across arms.

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides theoretical analysis and several algorithms for CABAI. First, a problem-dependent lower bound on the minimum cumulative cost is derived. Then two algorithms are proposed:

1. Cost-Aware Track and Stop (CTAS): Matches the cost lower bound asymptotically by carefully tracking the optimal ratio of pulls across arms based on cost. Forced exploration ensures accurate estimates. Stopping rule utilizes likelihood ratio test.

2. Chernoff Overlap (CO): A low complexity "model-free" algorithm based on successively eliminating suboptimal arms. The sampling rule intuitively pulls the arm that gives maximum information per unit cost, approximated using confidence interval overlap. Works very well empirically across problem instances.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the CABAI problem capturing cost-reward tradeoff and heterogeneous costs 
- Provides instance-dependent cost lower bound and asymptotically optimal CTAS algorithm
- Develops the simple and empirically high-performing CO algorithm with theoretical guarantees in special cases
- Extensive experiments validate the need to account for heterogeneous costs and demonstrate practical usefulness of the proposed techniques

Key Takeaway:
Accounting for heterogeneous costs across actions is crucial in many real-world sequential decision making problems. The formulations and algorithms developed in this paper provide a principled way to tackle such problems. Simple techniques like CO work surprisingly well while still having theoretical grounding.
