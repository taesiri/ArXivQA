# [Unsupervised Contour Tracking of Live Cells by Mechanical and Cycle   Consistency Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we accurately track the dynamic changes in the morphology of live cells by tracking every point along the cellular contour (contour tracking)? 

The key challenges the authors aim to address are:

1) Live cell contours exhibit visual features that are difficult to distinguish, so traditional optical flow methods may fail. 

2) The expansion and contraction of the cellular contour changes the total number of points, which poses a challenge for tracking methods that rely on a fixed number of points.

3) There is no ground truth data available for supervising a machine learning model for dense contour tracking.

To address these challenges, the main hypothesis is that an unsupervised deep learning model can be trained to track live cell contours densely using mechanical and cycle consistency losses, without requiring manual annotations for supervision.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised deep learning approach for dense contour tracking of live cells, which has not been addressed effectively in prior work. The key novelty is using mechanical and cycle consistency losses to train the model without ground truth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a deep learning-based method for contour tracking of live cells with dense point correspondences. The key points are:

- They propose the first deep learning model that can track cellular contours densely while outperforming other methods in accuracy. 

- They present an unsupervised learning strategy comprised of mechanical and cycle consistency losses to train the contour tracker without ground truth data. 

- They show that using forward and backward cross attention together with cycle consistency leads to more accurate dense correspondences. 

- They provide the first quantitative evaluation of cellular contour tracking by labeling tracking points in live cell videos.

- Their contour tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on two live cell datasets and can generalize to track other viscoelastic materials like jellyfish.

In summary, this paper makes significant advances in dense contour tracking of live cells and viscoelastic materials, which prior computer vision methods struggled with. The proposed unsupervised deep learning approach outperforms previous models and enables more accurate analysis of cellular morphodynamics.
