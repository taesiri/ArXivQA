# [Unsupervised Contour Tracking of Live Cells by Mechanical and Cycle   Consistency Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we accurately track the dynamic changes in the morphology of live cells by tracking every point along the cellular contour (contour tracking)? 

The key challenges the authors aim to address are:

1) Live cell contours exhibit visual features that are difficult to distinguish, so traditional optical flow methods may fail. 

2) The expansion and contraction of the cellular contour changes the total number of points, which poses a challenge for tracking methods that rely on a fixed number of points.

3) There is no ground truth data available for supervising a machine learning model for dense contour tracking.

To address these challenges, the main hypothesis is that an unsupervised deep learning model can be trained to track live cell contours densely using mechanical and cycle consistency losses, without requiring manual annotations for supervision.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised deep learning approach for dense contour tracking of live cells, which has not been addressed effectively in prior work. The key novelty is using mechanical and cycle consistency losses to train the model without ground truth data.
