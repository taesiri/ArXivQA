# [Unsupervised Contour Tracking of Live Cells by Mechanical and Cycle   Consistency Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we accurately track the dynamic changes in the morphology of live cells by tracking every point along the cellular contour (contour tracking)? 

The key challenges the authors aim to address are:

1) Live cell contours exhibit visual features that are difficult to distinguish, so traditional optical flow methods may fail. 

2) The expansion and contraction of the cellular contour changes the total number of points, which poses a challenge for tracking methods that rely on a fixed number of points.

3) There is no ground truth data available for supervising a machine learning model for dense contour tracking.

To address these challenges, the main hypothesis is that an unsupervised deep learning model can be trained to track live cell contours densely using mechanical and cycle consistency losses, without requiring manual annotations for supervision.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised deep learning approach for dense contour tracking of live cells, which has not been addressed effectively in prior work. The key novelty is using mechanical and cycle consistency losses to train the model without ground truth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a deep learning-based method for contour tracking of live cells with dense point correspondences. The key points are:

- They propose the first deep learning model that can track cellular contours densely while outperforming other methods in accuracy. 

- They present an unsupervised learning strategy comprised of mechanical and cycle consistency losses to train the contour tracker without ground truth data. 

- They show that using forward and backward cross attention together with cycle consistency leads to more accurate dense correspondences. 

- They provide the first quantitative evaluation of cellular contour tracking by labeling tracking points in live cell videos.

- Their contour tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on two live cell datasets and can generalize to track other viscoelastic materials like jellyfish.

In summary, this paper makes significant advances in dense contour tracking of live cells and viscoelastic materials, which prior computer vision methods struggled with. The proposed unsupervised deep learning approach outperforms previous models and enables more accurate analysis of cellular morphodynamics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning method for tracking points along highly deformable cellular contours in microscopy videos, using mechanical and cycle consistency losses to account for the complex motions and lack of ground truth data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in cellular contour tracking and quantification of morphodynamics:

- It proposes the first deep learning-based model for dense contour tracking of live cells. Prior work like optical flow methods or the mechanical model have limitations in accurately handling the complex motions and visual features of live cell contours.

- The method uses unsupervised learning with mechanical and cycle consistency losses to train the contour tracker. This avoids the need for laborious manual labeling of dense correspondences along the contour. Other recent deep learning approaches like PoST rely more heavily on supervised learning.

- Quantitative evaluation on labeled tracking points shows superior performance over prior methods like optical flow, PoST, and the mechanical model. This provides an objective benchmark for the accuracy of different contour tracking approaches.

- The architecture uses cross attention and offset regression which is tailored for this contour correspondence problem. Ablations demonstrate the benefit of components like forward/backward cross attention over other variants. 

- The work demonstrates application to different microscopy modalities (phase contrast and fluorescence) as well as viscoelastic organisms (live cells and jellyfish). This shows the generalizability and robustness of the approach.

- Limitations are the reliance on segmentation, inability to handle contour splitting, and lack of joint training with segmentation. But overall, this paper makes significant advances in the problem of contour tracking and quantification of cellular morphodynamics.

In summary, the key innovations are in proposing the first deep learning solution for this task, using an unsupervised learning strategy well-suited to the problem, and objectively demonstrating through benchmarks and ablations the advantages of their approach over prior arts. The work moves the field forward in enabling more accurate computational analysis of dynamic cellular morphology.
