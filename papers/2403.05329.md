## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that previous fusion-based 3D occupancy prediction methods relied on depth estimation to process 2D image features. However, depth estimation is an ill-posed problem. What issues does this cause for previous methods and how does the proposed OccFusion method address this?

2. OccFusion utilizes a point cloud sampling algorithm to generate synthetic points for voxels with sparse LiDAR points. What is the rationale behind this? How does it facilitate effective sampling of image features?

3. The OccFusion module performs point-to-point fusion of 3D LiDAR voxel features and 2D image features. Explain the complete process of how this fusion happens, including the role of deformable cross attention. 

4. Active M-CONet adopts an active learning-inspired principle to selectively split challenging voxels and learn from difficult areas. What metric is used to determine if a voxel is challenging? And how does focusing on these voxels improve small object detection?

5. The paper proposes an active training strategy that prioritizes more difficult samples in each epoch. Explain how the loss function is used to rank sample difficulty. Why is this beneficial?

6. Experiments show that the proposed method reduces GFLOPs and GPU memory consumption compared to prior state-of-the-art. What aspects of the OccFusion module and Active M-CONet pipeline contribute to improved efficiency?

7. Ablation studies demonstrate that farthest point sampling and synthetic point generation are important components. Analyze why these point cloud pre-processing steps lead to better performance.  

8. How does the proportion of voxels selected for refinement in the active coarse-to-fine pipeline impact performance and efficiency? Discuss this trade-off.

9. For the active training strategy, the paper shows performance peaks when 70% of samples are used for re-training each epoch. Speculate why using fewer or greater samples leads to worse mIoU.

10. The method sets new state-of-the-art results on the OpenOccupancy benchmark. Analyze the categories where the most significant performance gains are observed. Are the results aligned with the motivations for this approach?
