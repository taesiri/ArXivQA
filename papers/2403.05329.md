## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- 3D occupancy prediction based on multi-sensor fusion is important for autonomous driving systems to understand 3D scenes. 
- Prior fusion-based approaches rely on depth estimation to process 2D image features, but depth estimation is an ill-posed problem which hinders accuracy and robustness.  
- Fine-grained occupancy prediction also demands extensive computational resources.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce OccFusion, a multi-modal fusion method without depth estimation to fuse 2D image and 3D LiDAR features.
- Propose point cloud sampling to achieve dense and uniform points for effectively sampling image features.
- Develop an active training method to prioritize learning from complex samples.
- Propose an active coarse-to-fine pipeline to adaptively refine predictions in challenging areas while optimizing efficiency.

Key Contributions:
- Depth estimation-free OccFusion module for direct fusion of 2D and 3D features.
- Point cloud sampling algorithm for improved image feature sampling.  
- Active training method to enhance model robustness.
- Active coarse-to-fine pipeline to focus on refining predictions for challenging voxels. 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenOccupancy benchmark with higher efficiency in training and inference.
- Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces novel techniques for efficient and accurate multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction without relying on depth estimation, enabling robust perception for autonomous driving systems.
