# [Applications of machine learning and IoT for Outdoor Air Pollution   Monitoring and Prediction: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Air pollution is a major global health threat causing millions of deaths every year. Monitoring and predicting air quality is crucial for protecting public health and developing mitigation strategies. This paper conducts a systematic literature review to analyze recent applications of machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for outdoor air pollution prediction. Specifically, the paper seeks to identify the machine learning models used for prediction and the monitoring sensors and input features that enable this prediction.

Methods: 
The authors follow the PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews. They search major scientific databases using queries related to machine learning, air pollution, sensors and monitoring. After screening 1086 papers, 37 are selected that use machine learning for outdoor air pollution prediction based on data from monitoring sensors. The sensors are categorized as low-cost IoT sensors, expensive stations, or a hybrid approach. The papers are analyzed to identify prediction methods, models, pollutants, geographical distribution, and monitoring strategies.  

Key Findings:
- Prediction methods include time series forecasting, feature-based prediction, and spatio-temporal prediction. 
- Low-cost IoT sensors are used more in Asia and Africa while expensive monitoring is used more in Europe and North America.  
- Most papers predict PM2.5, with fewer predicting other pollutants like Ozone or Nitrogen Dioxide. Meteorology is the most common input feature.
- Hybrid monitoring delivers the best performance by combining low-cost sensors and expensive stations.
- Machine learning models like Random Forests and Neural Networks are widely applied for prediction.

Conclusions:
The review shows machine learning and IoT monitoring can effectively predict outdoor air pollution globally. Key limitations are lack of coverage, data diversity and input features. Main recommendations are using hybrid monitoring, comparing geographically similar regions, spatial-temporal forecasting, estimating hard-to-measure pollutants with machine learning, and exploring links with health data. Practical implications span air quality monitoring, healthcare, urban planning and smart cities.
