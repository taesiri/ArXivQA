# [Time-Efficient Light-Field Acquisition Using Coded Aperture and Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07244)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Acquiring light fields is challenging due to the large number of images required. Coded aperture imaging can reduce the number of images needed, but still requires multiple images captured sequentially, leading to long measurement times. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a time-efficient light field acquisition method that combines a coded aperture with an event camera, allowing measurement in a single exposure. 
- The method applies a sequence of coding patterns to the aperture during a single exposure. The resulting image frame captures the sum of coded images, while events capture parallax between patterns.
- The image and events are fed into a deep neural network to reconstruct the full light field. The network is trained end-to-end to optimize coding patterns and reconstruction.

Key Ideas:
- Events are induced by actively changing aperture coding, instead of scene motion or camera movement as in prior event-based methods.
- Method is theoretically quasi-equivalent to acquiring multiple coded aperture images sequentially.
- Careful network design ensures compatibility with real camera hardware constraints.
- Flexible contrast threshold makes method robust to sensor specifics.

Main Contributions:
- First method to combine coded aperture imaging and event cameras for computational light field imaging.
- Enables light field measurement in a single exposure, overcoming frame rate limitations.
- Achieves more accurate reconstruction than other single-shot methods.
- Developed hardware prototype and demonstrated successfully capturing real 3D scenes.
- Proposed time-efficient paradigm has potential for application to light field videos of dynamic scenes.
