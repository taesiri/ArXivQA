# [An Experimental Study: Assessing the Combined Framework of WavLM and   BEST-RQ for Text-to-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper aims to develop a text-to-speech (TTS) model that generates high-quality, natural sounding speech. Existing TTS models still lack the ability to produce speech with natural prosody. This paper proposes a new model that combines elements from WavLM, a pre-trained speech model with state-of-the-art performance, and BEST-RQ, a framework well-suited for a range of speech tasks. The goal is to assess whether combining these techniques will improve TTS performance. Specifically, the paper focuses on semantic tasks that could facilitate more natural and contextually correct speech.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution integrates the WavLM encoder with the BEST-RQ vector quantization framework. This architecture takes two passes through WavLM. First, raw audio is fed through the convolutional featurizer to output learned feature representations. Then the features are fed into the BEST-RQ component which uses a random projection quantizer to compute target labels for the features. These target labels are used to mask regions of the features using a masking strategy similar to that in Wav2Vec2. The masked features are then fed back into the WavLM encoder to produce predicted labels. The combination of models aims to leverage the strong pre-trained capabilities of WavLM with the wider suitability of BEST-RQ for diverse speech tasks.

Experiments and Results: 
The model was pretrained on 960 hours of LibriSpeech data and fine-tuned for semantic downstream tasks - intent classification, slot filling and speech translation. These tasks were benchmarked using the SUPERB toolkit. However, the achieved test accuracies were very low compared to state-of-the-art supervised models. The key limitations identified are: (1) The static random projection quantizer may poorly discriminate speech features. (2) Quantizing raw audio instead of spectrograms may have decreased feature quality.

Main Contributions:
The main contributions are the proposed architecture for combining self-supervised speech models, the detailed experimental analysis on semantic speech tasks using standard benchmarks, and the insights gained about why this architecture failed to improve performance. The negative results are valuable for guiding future research to uncover better TTS solutions.
