# [Beyond Embeddings: The Promise of Visual Table in Multi-Modal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Beyond Embeddings: The Promise of Visual Table in Multi-Modal Models":

Problem:
- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) rely on visual embeddings like CLIP to understand images. However, these lack access to external world knowledge that is critical for real-world visual reasoning. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes "Visual Table", a novel visual representation tailored for MLLMs. 
- A visual table provides hierarchical text descriptions of holistic visual scenes, including a scene description and multiple object-centric descriptions covering categories, attributes and knowledge at instance level.
- The authors design prompts and leverage GPT4V to generate 61K visual table annotations on COCO images. 
- Using these annotations, they train a generator model based on a half-baked MLLM to learn visual table generation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of visual tables as a new form of structured, symbolic visual representation that encodes scene, objects, attributes and instance-level knowledge.
- A new dataset of 61K visual tables curated from GPT4V.
- A scalable visual table generator that can automatically produce high-quality tables.
- Extensive experiments showing that visual tables as additional representations consistently improve state-of-the-art MLLMs across 11 diverse benchmarks. Also, using visual tables alone can closely match performance of MLLMs with CLIP embeddings.

In summary, the visual table is proposed as a promising visual representation that encapsulates richer information including world knowledge about visual scenes. When used with MLLMs, visual tables facilitate complex visual reasoning across different tasks. The results highlight their potential as resilient, generalizable representations for visual understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Visual Table, a novel visual representation for images that provides hierarchical text descriptions consisting of a scene description and object-centric descriptions with categories, attributes, and knowledge; and demonstrates that using Visual Tables as additional inputs consistently improves state-of-the-art multi-modal language models across diverse benchmarks.

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Visual representation learning
- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) 
- Visual tables
- Scene descriptions
- Object categories
- Object attributes  
- Object knowledge
- Instance-level knowledge
- Structured text
- Visual understanding and reasoning

The paper proposes a new form of visual representation called "visual tables" which are presented in structured text and encode information about the scene, objects, attributes, and knowledge in images. A key aspect is the instance-level object knowledge going beyond just categories and attributes. The visual tables are explored in the context of multi-modal large language models to enhance visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Visual Tables as a new form of visual representation. What are the key components of a Visual Table and how does it aim to provide a more comprehensive encoding of an image compared to existing visual representations?

2. The paper uses GPT4V to generate a small-scale dataset of Visual Table annotations on COCO images. What was the rationale behind using GPT4V for this instead of other image captioning or scene graph generation models? 

3. The Visual Table generator model is trained on the GPT4V-generated Visual Table annotations. What modifications were made to the LLaVA-1.5 architecture to adapt it for Visual Table generation? Why was LLaVA-1.5 chosen as the base model?

4. What are the advantages of generating Visual Tables independently instead of on-the-fly within the LLaVA-VT model? Could the Visual Table generator potentially be improved by fine-tuning jointly with LLaVA-VT instead of pre-training separately?

5. How exactly are the generated Visual Tables incorporated within the LLaVA-VT model? Does it simply concatenate them as extra tokens or integrate them in a more complex way into the architecture? 

6. Could the Visual Tables complement other MLLM innovations like chain-of-thought prompting? How could Visual Tables capture intermediate reasoning steps in addition to final outputs?

7. The results show consistent gains from using Visual Tables across many MLLM benchmarks. But are there some task types where they provide smaller or no gains? Are there opportunities to tailor the Visual Table design to specific downstream use cases?  

8. Visual Tables are shown to boost performance even when used alone without CLIP embeddings. Could Visual Tables fully replace CLIP embeddings in MLLMs? What are the relative tradeoffs?

9. The paper focuses on images, but notes potential for Visual Tables in videos and 3D data. What modifications would be needed to adapt the Visual Table approach for videos or 3D scenes?

10. What steps could be taken to reduce annotation artifacts and biases when using a model like GPT4V to generate training data? How sensitive are the results to the specific prompts used for GPT4V annotation generation?
