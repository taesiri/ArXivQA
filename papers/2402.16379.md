# [Improving LLM-based Machine Translation with Systematic Self-Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16379)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can produce high-quality machine translations, but still make errors that need correction. 
- Prior work on using LLMs to refine translations has limitations: lacks clear evaluation of initial translations, ineffective feedback to guide corrections, translations not sourced from the LLM itself.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a 3-step LLM-based self-correction translation framework called TER (Translate, Estimate, Refine)
- Translate: Use LLM to generate initial translation 
- Estimate: Use same LLM to evaluate quality of translation and identify errors (provides feedback)
- Refine: Use LLM to correct its own translation based on the feedback

Key Contributions:
- TER significantly improves translation quality over initial translations and other baseline methods across various languages and models
- Thorough analysis provides insights into how different components of TER contribute to performance
- Exploration of translation ability vs evaluation ability across models reveals trends of consistency in some languages but not others
- Demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness of using a single LLM for full translation lifecycle with self-correction based on internal feedback

In summary, this paper makes important progress towards interpretable and self-evolving LLM-based translation systems by introducing TER, a method for LLMs to systematically estimate quality of their own translations and leverage that feedback to refine and improve output. Both empirical results and detailed component analyses demonstrate the promise of this approach.
