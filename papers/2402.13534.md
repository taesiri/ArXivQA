# [An Effective Incorporating Heterogeneous Knowledge Curriculum Learning   for Sequence Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sequence labeling models often benefit from incorporating external knowledge, which introduces data heterogeneity and model complexity, requiring more resources for training high-performing models. 

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage curriculum learning (TCL) framework specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks like Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging.

- First stage - Data-level CL: Train a basic teacher model on all data to establish initial sample order for the student model to help it warm up.

- Second stage - Model-level CL: Dynamically adjust sample order based on difficulty metrics tailored to sequence labeling tasks and current state of student model. Gradually introduce more difficult samples over training process.

Difficulty Metrics:
- Pre-defined: Sentence length 
- Model-aware: 
    - Top-N Least Confidence (TLC): Average confidence of N most uncertain tokens
    - Maximum Normalized Log-Probability (MNLP): Log probability normalized by sentence length 
    - Bayesian Uncertainty (BU): Variance of predicted probabilities

Main Contributions:
- Proposed TCL framework that enhances performance of various sequence labeling models and reduces training time by over 20%
- Designed and compared difficulty metrics at token and word levels for sequence labeling tasks
- Demonstrated framework's effectiveness through experiments on CWS and POS tagging tasks across 6 datasets
- Showed flexibility to integrate TCL with different sequence labeling models like BERT/RoBERTa+Softmax and complex models using knowledge integration

The paper makes useful contributions in designing curriculum learning strategies tailored to address challenges with incorporating external knowledge into sequence labeling models.
