# [Reducing Texture Bias of Deep Neural Networks via Edge Enhancing   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09530)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) tend to rely heavily on texture patterns rather than shape information when making image predictions/classifications. This "texture bias" causes them to prioritize local details over higher-level semantics.  
- In contrast, human vision relies more on shape cues than texture. So reducing texture bias could make CNNs more aligned with human perception.

Proposed Solution:
- Use edge enhancing diffusion (EED), an anisotropic image diffusion method, to pre-process images and reduce texture before feeding them to CNNs for training and testing. 
- EED smooths color along edges but prevents smoothing across edges, so it removes texture while preserving shapes.
- Train CNNs on EED processed images to make them reliant on shape rather than texture cues.

Contributions:
- Introduce EED with orientation smoothing as a novel pre-processing technique to reduce texture bias in CNNs for image classification and segmentation.
- Demonstrate CNNs trained on EED images become ignorant/robust to texture variations at test time with only moderate task performance drops.
- Show transformers have less texture bias than CNNs to begin with, but EED can further reduce it. 
- Detailed segment-level analysis reveals performance loss on EED images correlates with vanishing object boundaries during over-diffusion.
- Using EED for defense against adversarial attacks by filtering perturbations.
- Suggest EED can serve as a general technique to evaluate texture bias reductions across networks.

In summary, the paper proposes EED pre-processing of images as an effective way to reduce harmful texture bias in CNNs and make them focus more on shape cues like human perception. This contributes to more reliable and robust CNN image understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using edge enhancing diffusion, an anisotropic image diffusion method, to preprocess images and train neural networks on the diffused images to reduce texture bias and make the networks more reliant on shape information for tasks like image classification and semantic segmentation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. For the first time, introducing an EED-based pre-processing with orientation smoothing for deep learning to analyze and reduce texture bias in image classification and semantic segmentation. The careful parameter selection provides EED duplicates of datasets with reduced texture while preserving shape.

2. Using EED, reporting strong texture bias of CNNs in semantic segmentation and image classification, and confirming a rather moderate texture bias for transformers in semantic segmentation. 

3. In both cases (image classification and semantic segmentation), demonstrating that EED pre-processing makes DNNs almost ignorant with respect to local texture patterns, while the task performance loss remains moderate. 

4. A detailed segment-level analysis that reveals much of the task performance loss can be attributed to over-diffusing in visually challenging situations.

In summary, the main contribution is using edge enhancing diffusion (EED) as a pre-processing method to reduce texture bias in deep neural networks for tasks like image classification and semantic segmentation, and showing through experiments that this makes the models more robust to texture changes while maintaining decent task performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Edge enhancing diffusion (EED): A partial differential equation (PDE) based anisotropic image diffusion method used to create texture reduced duplicate images and datasets. A core technique explored in the paper.

- Texture bias: The tendency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to rely more on texture patterns rather than shape or structure when making predictions. A key concept the paper aims to analyze and reduce. 

- Semantic segmentation: A computer vision task, involving assigning a class label to every pixel in an image, used as a main application area in experiments.

- Transformers: A neural network architecture, contrasted with CNNs in terms of texture bias.

- Shape bias: The reliance on shape information over texture, said to be more pronounced in transformers compared to CNNs.

- Adversarial robustness: Robustness against adversarial attacks is analyzed for networks trained on original vs. EED processed data.

- Domain generalization: Analyzed in terms of texture differences between datasets - training CNNs on EED data does not clearly improve domain generalization.

So in summary, key terms revolve around texture bias, EED diffusion, semantic segmentation, transformer networks, adversarial robustness, etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
