# [Representable Markov Categories and Comparison of Statistical   Experiments in Categorical Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07416)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper addresses the question of how to generalize the classical Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem on comparing statistical experiments to the abstract setting of Markov categories. The main hypotheses are:1. Markov categories provide a suitable framework for developing probability theory synthetically, allowing one to state and prove generalizations of classical theorems. 2. The classical BSS theorem can be generalized to Markov categories that are representable and allow for Bayesian inference, i.e. have conditionals.Specifically, the paper aims to prove versions of the BSS theorem that hold in any representable Markov category with conditionals, not just the traditional setting of standard Borel spaces. This is done by introducing notions like standard experiments, standard measures, and dilations abstractly in Markov categories. The core result is Theorem 5.11, which shows that an experiment $f$ is more informative than $g$ with respect to a prior $m$ if and only if the standard measure of $g$ second-order dominates that of $f$. This holds in any representable Markov category with conditionals.The paper also explores a fully prior-independent version of the BSS theorem by considering Markov kernels parameterized by priors. Overall, it demonstrates the potential of Markov categories to generalize key results in probability and statistics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper makes several contributions to the theory of Markov categories and categorical probability:1. It clarifies the relationship between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of affine symmetric monoidal monads. In particular, it shows that a Markov category is representable (i.e. has internal distribution objects) if and only if it arises as the Kleisli category of such a monad.2. It provides a categorical definition and characterization of second-order stochastic dominance, which allows comparing probability distributions based on their spread. 3. It proves abstract versions of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem, which connects the comparison of statistical experiments to second-order stochastic dominance of their "standard measures". This includes versions for general and discrete parameter spaces, as well as a fully prior-independent version.4. Along the way, it introduces and studies properties of "almost surely" equality and representability in Markov categories.Overall, the paper significantly advances the categorical foundations of probability theory and statistics by proving generalized versions of classic results. The abstract setting also clarifies the key concepts and makes them applicable more broadly. Representability and the sampling cancellation property are identified as the crucial ingredients that enable these theorems.In summary, the main contribution is developing the theory of comparison of statistical experiments fully synthetically within Markov categories, facilitated by the conceptual advances on representability and almost sure equality. This showcases the power of the categorical approach to probability and statistics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper lays the foundation for comparing statistical experiments abstractly in the framework of Markov categories, proving versions of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem relating experiment comparison to second-order stochastic dominance of standard measures and developing the theory of representable Markov categories along the way.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a categorical approach to generalizing concepts from probability theory and statistics, such as second-order stochastic dominance and the comparison of statistical experiments. Here are some ways this research compares to other work:- It builds on previous work developing "Markov categories" as a categorical foundation for probability theory. The key innovation is using this framework to state and prove abstract versions of classic results like the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem.- Most prior work on categorical probability focused on reconstructing basic probability theory concepts synthetically (e.g. almost sure equality, Bayesian inference). This paper pushes further into statistical concepts.- The results generalize beyond standard measure-theoretic probability theory. By working categorically, the theorems apply not only in Markov categories like BorelStoch, but more broadly wherever the axioms are satisfied.- There has been some related work developing synthetic information theory using categorical probability, but less on synthetic statistics. This paper helps fill that gap.- The parametrized Markov category construction is a novel tool introduced to prove more general versions of the results not tied to a fixed prior. This extra level of generality is an innovative aspect.- The connections made to things like thunk-force categories and doctrinal adjunctions link the work firmly into the broader field of applied category theory.In summary, this research represents a significant advance in the categorical probability program. By tackling more advanced statistical concepts synthetically, it demonstrates the power and potential of the Markov category approach as a foundation for probability and statistics. The novel constructions and high level of generality are impressive contributions.
