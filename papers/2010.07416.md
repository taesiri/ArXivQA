# [Representable Markov Categories and Comparison of Statistical   Experiments in Categorical Probability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07416)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the question of how to generalize the classical Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem on comparing statistical experiments to the abstract setting of Markov categories. The main hypotheses are:

1. Markov categories provide a suitable framework for developing probability theory synthetically, allowing one to state and prove generalizations of classical theorems. 

2. The classical BSS theorem can be generalized to Markov categories that are representable and allow for Bayesian inference, i.e. have conditionals.

Specifically, the paper aims to prove versions of the BSS theorem that hold in any representable Markov category with conditionals, not just the traditional setting of standard Borel spaces. This is done by introducing notions like standard experiments, standard measures, and dilations abstractly in Markov categories. 

The core result is Theorem 5.11, which shows that an experiment $f$ is more informative than $g$ with respect to a prior $m$ if and only if the standard measure of $g$ second-order dominates that of $f$. This holds in any representable Markov category with conditionals.

The paper also explores a fully prior-independent version of the BSS theorem by considering Markov kernels parameterized by priors. Overall, it demonstrates the potential of Markov categories to generalize key results in probability and statistics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several contributions to the theory of Markov categories and categorical probability:

1. It clarifies the relationship between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of affine symmetric monoidal monads. In particular, it shows that a Markov category is representable (i.e. has internal distribution objects) if and only if it arises as the Kleisli category of such a monad.

2. It provides a categorical definition and characterization of second-order stochastic dominance, which allows comparing probability distributions based on their spread. 

3. It proves abstract versions of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem, which connects the comparison of statistical experiments to second-order stochastic dominance of their "standard measures". This includes versions for general and discrete parameter spaces, as well as a fully prior-independent version.

4. Along the way, it introduces and studies properties of "almost surely" equality and representability in Markov categories.

Overall, the paper significantly advances the categorical foundations of probability theory and statistics by proving generalized versions of classic results. The abstract setting also clarifies the key concepts and makes them applicable more broadly. Representability and the sampling cancellation property are identified as the crucial ingredients that enable these theorems.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the theory of comparison of statistical experiments fully synthetically within Markov categories, facilitated by the conceptual advances on representability and almost sure equality. This showcases the power of the categorical approach to probability and statistics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper lays the foundation for comparing statistical experiments abstractly in the framework of Markov categories, proving versions of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem relating experiment comparison to second-order stochastic dominance of standard measures and developing the theory of representable Markov categories along the way.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a categorical approach to generalizing concepts from probability theory and statistics, such as second-order stochastic dominance and the comparison of statistical experiments. Here are some ways this research compares to other work:

- It builds on previous work developing "Markov categories" as a categorical foundation for probability theory. The key innovation is using this framework to state and prove abstract versions of classic results like the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem.

- Most prior work on categorical probability focused on reconstructing basic probability theory concepts synthetically (e.g. almost sure equality, Bayesian inference). This paper pushes further into statistical concepts.

- The results generalize beyond standard measure-theoretic probability theory. By working categorically, the theorems apply not only in Markov categories like BorelStoch, but more broadly wherever the axioms are satisfied.

- There has been some related work developing synthetic information theory using categorical probability, but less on synthetic statistics. This paper helps fill that gap.

- The parametrized Markov category construction is a novel tool introduced to prove more general versions of the results not tied to a fixed prior. This extra level of generality is an innovative aspect.

- The connections made to things like thunk-force categories and doctrinal adjunctions link the work firmly into the broader field of applied category theory.

In summary, this research represents a significant advance in the categorical probability program. By tackling more advanced statistical concepts synthetically, it demonstrates the power and potential of the Markov category approach as a foundation for probability and statistics. The novel constructions and high level of generality are impressive contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring the full scope of synthetic generalizations of results like the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem to Markov categories beyond the traditional measure-theoretic setting. The authors show this is possible in any Markov category with conditionals and representability, but they have only begun to explore the possibilities.

- Developing a synthetic version of the quantum Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem using recently developed quantum Markov categories. This could have applications to quantum hypothesis testing and quantum error correction. 

- Using the categorical approach to study variants of the theory of statistical experiments with additional restrictions on the garbling maps, such as requiring equivariance under group actions. The authors suggest their theorem formulations could be adapted to obtain measure-theoretic BSS theorems in such contexts.

- Connecting the categorical theory to resource theories of distinguishability, which provide another framework for studying restrictions on comparisons of statistical experiments.

- Developing the algebraic approach to statistical models further, drawing on connections to categorical logic.

- Exploring statistical models and experiments represented as morphisms in diagram categories, as a foundation for a synthetic theory of stochastic processes.

In summary, the main future directions are leveraging the generality and flexibility of the categorical framework to obtain more general versions of core results, study variations of statistical experiments, and make connections to other frameworks like quantum theory, resource theories, and stochastic processes.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops the theory of Markov categories, which provide a categorical foundation for probability theory and statistics. The authors establish connections between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of probability monads. They introduce the notion of representable Markov categories, which have internal spaces of probability distributions, and prove that these categories arise from probability monads. The authors use this framework to prove abstract versions of results on comparison of statistical experiments, including the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem relating informativeness of experiments to second-order stochastic dominance of distributions. The results apply in any representable Markov category satisfying some mild assumptions, demonstrating the generality of the categorical approach. Overall, the paper advances the categorical probability program by further developing the theory of Markov categories and using it to synthetically prove fundamental results on comparison of statistical experiments.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops the theory of Markov categories, which provide a categorical foundation for probability theory and statistics. The authors show that Markov categories can arise as Kleisli categories of probability monads, clarifying the relationship between these two frameworks. A key contribution is the notion of representable Markov categories, which have distribution objects modeling spaces of probability measures. The paper proves that such categories are equivalent to Kleisli categories of symmetric monoidal monads satisfying a pullback condition. 

The authors then use representable Markov categories to generalize two important concepts from statistics: second-order stochastic dominance for comparing probability distributions, and the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem for comparing statistical experiments. Versions of these results are proven abstractly and then specialized to recover the classical measure-theoretic statements. A parametrized Markov category is introduced to obtain a version of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem that does not require a fixed prior distribution. Overall, the categorical perspective provides increased generality and new insights into foundational results in probability and statistics.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper develops a categorical framework for probability theory and statistics based on the notion of Markov categories. It establishes connections between Markov categories and Kleisli categories of probability monads, introducing the concept of representable Markov categories. For such categories, the paper defines and studies second-order stochastic dominance as a way of comparing probability distributions abstractly. It also proves a version of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem, characterizing when one statistical experiment is more informative than another in terms of second-order stochastic dominance of the corresponding standard measures. The theorem is established first for fixed priors, and then in a prior-independent form by considering Markov categories parametrized by a space of priors. Overall, the main method is the development of abstract categorical concepts like Markov categories and their application to foundational questions in probability and statistics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a categorical characterization of second-order stochastic dominance, a notion for comparing probability distributions based on how "spread out" they are. The paper defines second-order dominance abstractly in representable Markov categories and relates it to the existence of dilations.

2. It proves a categorical version of the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem, a fundamental result connecting the comparison of statistical experiments to second-order stochastic dominance of their "standard measures". The paper's version works for general parameter spaces beyond the traditional finite/discrete case. 

3. It introduces the concept of a "Bayesian" informativeness ordering for statistical experiments, formalized using parametric Markov categories. This leads to a parametrized version of the BSS theorem that avoids referring to a fixed prior.

4. It clarifies the relationship between representable Markov categories (which have a notion of "distribution objects") and Kleisli categories of probability monads. This provides a bridge between the categorical probability and monadic approaches.

Overall, the main focus seems to be on categorically generalizing core ideas and theorems in probability and statistics, like stochastic dominance and comparison of experiments. The categorical perspective and results allow tackling these concepts in greater generality.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the notion of a "Markov category", which provides a categorical foundation for probability theory and statistics. Markov categories allow one to synthetically study various probabilistic concepts like Bayesian updating, conditional independence, almost sure equality, and sufficient statistics. The authors advance this theory by providing categorical generalizations of second-order stochastic dominance, a way of comparing probability distributions, and the classical Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem on comparison of statistical experiments. They introduce the notion of "representable" Markov categories, which have an internal "distribution functor" allowing one to talk about spaces of probability measures. They show representable Markov categories arise as Kleisli categories of probability monads satisfying a certain condition. Using representability, they prove abstract versions of second-order stochastic dominance and the Blackwell-Sherman-Stein theorem. This not only provides new insight into the proofs, but also makes the results more widely applicable, automatically specializing to standard measure-theoretic versions as well as Bayesian versions involving prior-dependent garbling. Overall, the paper develops the theory of Markov categories and demonstrates its power by providing categorical generalizations of fundamental results in probability and statistics.
