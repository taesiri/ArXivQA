## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal-decoupled masked pre-training framework called STD-MAE for traffic forecasting. The key idea is to leverage masked autoencoders that separately reconstruct masked input traffic data along the spatial and temporal dimensions during pre-training. This allows the model to learn representations that capture intricate long-range spatial and temporal correlations inherent in traffic data. Specifically, the framework contains two components: 1) Spatio-temporal decoupled masked autoencoders that use spatial masking and temporal masking strategies to encode traffic time series data into spatial and temporal representations. 2) A downstream spatio-temporal predictor that leverages the learned representations from the autoencoders to enhance its prediction performance. Extensive experiments on four traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of STD-MAE. Both quantitative results and qualitative analyses verify its ability to model spatio-temporal heterogeneity and long-range dependencies for accurate traffic forecasting.
