# [SPC-NeRF: Spatial Predictive Compression for Voxel Based Radiance Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Explicit voxel grid (EVG) representations of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve efficiency but have large memory costs. 
- Current EVG compression methods like pruning and quantization do not fully exploit spatial redundancy between voxels.

Proposed Method:
- Propose SPC-NeRF, a novel EVG compression framework using spatial predictive coding to remove spatial redundancy.
- Construct a reference graph to select optimal prediction voxels and record reference indexes.
- Design a rate-distortion (RD) loss with bitrate modeling to jointly optimize compression and quality.  
- Use a two-step finetuning strategy with hierarchical quantization on critical/non-critical voxels.

Contributions:
- Efficiently remove spatial redundancy in EVGs via spatial predictive coding for better compression.
- Novel RD loss enables jointly optimizing for compression ratio and distortion.
- Two-step finetuning and adaptive quantization maximize quality without excess bits.

Results:
- Achieves 28-32% lower bitrate than state-of-the-art VQRF method at same quality.
- Generates smooth RD curve that gracefully trades off bits for distortion.
- Visual quality very close to uncompressed EVG baseline.
- Outperforms across multiple datasets while adding little training overhead.

In summary, the paper introduces an EVG compression method using spatial prediction and RD optimization that sets a new state-of-the-art in compression rate while maintaining visual quality. The gains come from effectively exploiting voxel spatial correlations.
