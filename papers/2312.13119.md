# [Prometheus: Infrastructure Security Posture Analysis with AI-generated   Attack Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Scope:
The paper addresses the need for a holistic security assessment solution to analyze the security posture of computing infrastructures. Given the expanding attack surface due to increasing network complexity and influx of diverse software, there is a need to identify vulnerabilities specific to an infrastructure and understand how these vulnerabilities can be chained together into multi-step attacks. 

Proposed Solution - Prometheus:
The paper proposes Prometheus, an automated system to analyze the security posture of computing infrastructures. Prometheus takes user-provided details on network topology and device specifics as input. It retrieves relevant CVEs from vulnerability databases and processes them using natural language processing techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and word embeddings to extract semantic information like preconditions and postconditions. It then uses semantic similarity matching to construct cumulative (multi-layer) and layered attack graphs showing potential attack paths. Prometheus analyzes these attack graphs to evaluate security posture, prioritize vulnerabilities and identify high risk attack paths.

Key Contributions:
- An NLP pipeline to extract vulnerability semantics and automatically construct attack graphs without manual effort
- A multi-layer analysis approach that separates vulnerabilities into domains like networking, hardware etc. to enable focused analysis 
- Risk scoring methods that quantify vulnerability criticality and impact analysis tailored to the infrastructure  
- Implementation of an end-to-end automated security posture assessment system Prometheus

In summary, the paper presents Prometheus, a automated security analyzer that can ingest details of a computing infrastructure, construct comprehensive attack graphs spanning multiple technical domains, evaluate security posture through domain-based analysis and risk scoring techniques. The system aims to help security experts prioritize patching efforts and fortress infrastructure security.
