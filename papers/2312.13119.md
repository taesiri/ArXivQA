# [Prometheus: Infrastructure Security Posture Analysis with AI-generated   Attack Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13119)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Scope:
The paper addresses the need for a holistic security assessment solution to analyze the security posture of computing infrastructures. Given the expanding attack surface due to increasing network complexity and influx of diverse software, there is a need to identify vulnerabilities specific to an infrastructure and understand how these vulnerabilities can be chained together into multi-step attacks. 

Proposed Solution - Prometheus:
The paper proposes Prometheus, an automated system to analyze the security posture of computing infrastructures. Prometheus takes user-provided details on network topology and device specifics as input. It retrieves relevant CVEs from vulnerability databases and processes them using natural language processing techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and word embeddings to extract semantic information like preconditions and postconditions. It then uses semantic similarity matching to construct cumulative (multi-layer) and layered attack graphs showing potential attack paths. Prometheus analyzes these attack graphs to evaluate security posture, prioritize vulnerabilities and identify high risk attack paths.

Key Contributions:
- An NLP pipeline to extract vulnerability semantics and automatically construct attack graphs without manual effort
- A multi-layer analysis approach that separates vulnerabilities into domains like networking, hardware etc. to enable focused analysis 
- Risk scoring methods that quantify vulnerability criticality and impact analysis tailored to the infrastructure  
- Implementation of an end-to-end automated security posture assessment system Prometheus

In summary, the paper presents Prometheus, a automated security analyzer that can ingest details of a computing infrastructure, construct comprehensive attack graphs spanning multiple technical domains, evaluate security posture through domain-based analysis and risk scoring techniques. The system aims to help security experts prioritize patching efforts and fortress infrastructure security.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Prometheus is a system that analyzes the security posture of computing infrastructures by identifying vulnerabilities, constructing potential attack graphs, evaluating the exploitability of attack paths, and quantifying the overall security risk.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel system called Prometheus for comprehensively analyzing the security posture of computing infrastructures. Specifically, Prometheus:

- Uses machine learning and natural language processing to automatically extract semantic information from vulnerability disclosures to generate attack graphs without manual effort. 

- Adopts a layered approach to analyze vulnerabilities and attack paths within each layer (e.g. network, system, hardware, ML, cryptography) and also across layers.

- Proposes tailored risk scoring methods to evaluate the exploitability and impact of vulnerabilities and attack paths based on the criticality of resources in the infrastructure under analysis.

- Provides both cumulative and layered attack graphs along with comprehensive analytics to help identify high risk vulnerabilities and attack vectors needing immediate attention.

In summary, the key contribution is an automated security posture analysis system that holistically analyzes vulnerabilities, interconnections, risk factors, and attack surfaces to provide actionable insights into improving the security of complex computing infrastructures.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel security posture analyzer called Prometheus. What are the key capabilities and features offered by Prometheus compared to previous approaches for security posture analysis? How does it aim to provide a more comprehensive assessment?

2. One of the main challenges tackled in the paper is extracting useful security information from natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities. Explain in detail the named entity recognition (NER) model used by Prometheus to automatically extract attributes like preconditions and postconditions from vulnerability descriptions. 

3. The paper argues that using word embeddings trained specifically on a security corpus can better capture semantics for the security domain compared to general pre-trained embeddings. Explain the process and components used by Prometheus to curate the security corpus and generate tailored word embeddings.

4. Prometheus generates both cumulative and layered attack graphs. Explain the difference between these two types of graphs and the insights they aim to provide about the security posture. Provide examples of vulnerabilities that might appear in the different layers.

5. The risk scoring system in Prometheus builds on the CVSS standards but aims to provide assessment tailored to the specifics of the infrastructure being analyzed. Explain the edge scoring equations defined in the paper for exploitability, impact and risk of attack graph edges. 

6. Prometheus identifies high severity attack paths in the generated graphs. Describe the process it follows to compute scores for each path and how paths are prioritized based on the scores. What configurable options does it provide to administrators for customizing this process?

7. The paper describes how Prometheus can identify the minimum set of vulnerabilities that cover all attack paths in a graph. Explain the rationale behind identifying this set and how Prometheus approaches this problem algorithmically. 

8. Prometheus has been designed based on a microservices architecture spanning data curation, ML processing, attack graph construction, risk analysis and storage functions. Discuss the advantages of adopting this system design compared to a monolithic architecture.

9. The evaluation in the paper analyzes the NER model on a large vulnerability description dataset. Summarize the experiments performed and key results demonstrating the efficacy of the NER model. How does the model compare against spaCy baseline encoders?

10. Prometheus has been evaluated on an example system comprising GPU servers, routers, switches and RPi devices. Walk through the case study in detail â€“ the process followed for CVE collection, attack graph generation, risk scoring and insights obtained from analyzing the generated attack graphs.
