# [Small jet engine reservoir computing digital twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09978)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The concept of a "digital twin" has gained attention recently as a way to simulate complex physical systems virtually to reduce costs of prototyping and testing. However, creating accurate digital twin models remains challenging.
- The paper explores using a next generation reservoir computer (NG-RC), a type of machine learning algorithm good for modeling dynamical systems, to create a digital twin of a jet engine.

Methods:
- The authors first created an NG-RC model of a simulated single-scroll jet engine using the Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS). The model was trained to predict thrust using requested/actual shaft speed, exhaust gas temperature, and fuel-to-air ratio data.
- They then collected real sensor data from a JetCat P100-RX microturbine engine under different operating conditions and split it into training and testing sets. The sensor system measured thrust, temperatures, RPMs and other parameters.
- An NG-RC model was trained on the engine data to predict thrust. Key parameters included requested/actual shaft speed, fuel pump voltage and turbine skin temperature. The model has hyperparameters tuned to minimize error.

Results:
- The simulated engine model NG-RC predicted thrust with 1.9% normalized RMSE using less than 900 training points. It captured transient and steady-state behavior over the full operating range.
- The real engine data model predicted thrust within 1.8% normalized RMSE using only 140 training points. It generalized well to new test runs in different ambient conditions.

Conclusions:
- The paper shows an NG-RC can create an accurate and data-efficient digital twin of a jet engine for thrust prediction. Performance was demonstrated on both simulated and real engine data. The approach could be used for engine control applications.
