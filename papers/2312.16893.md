# [BBScore: A Brownian Bridge Based Metric for Assessing Text Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16893)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating text coherence is important for assessing quality of written content, but existing methods have limitations:
	- Entity-based methods rely on local transitions and struggle with informal text
	- Neural methods use static embeddings or focus narrowly on local context, limiting ability to measure global coherence
- Goal is to capture sequential, cohesive relationship among sentences representing main ideas/goals of a coherent text

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce BBScore, a reference-free metric grounded in Brownian bridge theory to assess global text coherence 
- Assume coherent text resembles a Brownian bridge process in latent space:
	 - Main idea kept throughout, emphasized at beginning/end
	 - Middle sentences can deviate but controlled
- Learn latent representations with contrastive training 
- Approximate diffusion coefficient from training data to characterize text style
- Define BBScore based on Brownian bridge likelihood to measure coherence

Contributions:
- Introduce diffusion coefficient to encode domain-specific text features
- Design BBScore metric to evaluate global and local coherence without full model training
- Show BBScore effectively differentiates human vs. AI text and recognizes differences across LLMs
- With simple classification component, achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art on coherence tasks
- Flexibility of BBScore allows application in various downstream tasks related to text quality

In summary, this paper presents a novel perspective on modeling text coherence using Brownian bridge theory. The proposed BBScore metric demonstrates strong performance in assessing coherence without complex model training. Key advantages include capturing global structure, encoding domain-specific style features, and enabling diverse downstream applications.
