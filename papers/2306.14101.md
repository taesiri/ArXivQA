# [Language models are weak learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14101)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as weak learners in a boosting framework, specifically for classifying tabular data. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) LLMs can be used to generate weak learners for boosting by leveraging their ability to summarize collections of textual examples. 2) These LLM-based weak learners can be effectively incorporated into a boosting framework like AdaBoost to create an ensemble classifier.3) This LLM boosting approach will outperform few-shot learning and occasionally even finetuning of LLMs on tasks with small amounts of training data.So in summary, the central research question is whether LLMs' summarization capabilities can be harnessed to produce weak learners that can in turn be boosted to create high-performing classifiers, especially in low-data regimes where leveraging the LLMs' prior knowledge is most beneficial. The experiments aim to validate if prompt-based LLMs can indeed serve as effective weak learners in this fashion.
