# [Language models are weak learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14101)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as weak learners in a boosting framework, specifically for classifying tabular data. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) LLMs can be used to generate weak learners for boosting by leveraging their ability to summarize collections of textual examples. 2) These LLM-based weak learners can be effectively incorporated into a boosting framework like AdaBoost to create an ensemble classifier.3) This LLM boosting approach will outperform few-shot learning and occasionally even finetuning of LLMs on tasks with small amounts of training data.So in summary, the central research question is whether LLMs' summarization capabilities can be harnessed to produce weak learners that can in turn be boosted to create high-performing classifiers, especially in low-data regimes where leveraging the LLMs' prior knowledge is most beneficial. The experiments aim to validate if prompt-based LLMs can indeed serve as effective weak learners in this fashion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is showing that large language models (LLMs) can be used as weak learners in a boosting framework for classifying tabular data. Specifically:- The authors propose converting tabular data to natural language descriptions to allow LLMs to work with tabular data through prompting. They show techniques like binning continuous features and generating descriptions with the LLM rather than templates improve performance.- The authors propose using the summarization capabilities of LLMs to create weak learning hypotheses. By prompting the LLM to summarize a subset of the training data, the resulting summary can serve as a template for making predictions on new examples. - These LLM-based weak learners are incorporated into an AdaBoost ensemble. The authors show this "Summary Boosting" approach outperforms few-shot learning with LLMs and sometimes traditional boosting methods, especially when data is limited.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that with proper data formatting and prompting, LLMs can serve as components in boosting-based pipelines for tabular data classification, without any gradient updates or fine-tuning of the LLM itself. This opens up new possibilities for combining LLMs with other classical ML techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper argues that large language models can serve as weak learners in a boosting framework when applied to tabular data classification through summarization prompting, outperforming few-shot learning approaches and occasionally even finetuning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on using large language models for tabular data classification:- This paper proposes a novel way of integrating large language models (LLMs) into boosting frameworks by having the LLM generate weak learners via summarization. Other works like PromptBoosting directly learn prompt representations. This approach avoids additional model training or parameter tuning.- The authors demonstrate their method on a diverse set of 18 tabular datasets. Most prior work focusing on LLMs for tabular data uses 1-2 datasets. The variety highlights the broad applicability of the approach.- The experiments show the method outperforming few-shot learning, highlighting the benefits of the boosting framework versus just prompting alone. Comparisons to finetuning and baselines like XGBoost also provide useful context.- The emphasis is on a pure prompting-based approach without model finetuning. Other works like TabTransformer or TabNet do full finetuning of model parameters on the tabular data. This makes the method applicable even when model internals are not accessible.- Ablations on prompt design and orderings highlight the impact of prompt engineering. Other literature has focused more on continuous prompt representations to avoid this.- Limitations like performance on highly numerical data are acknowledged. This contrasts with some pure natural language tasks where LLMs have seen more success.Overall, the approach makes useful connections between prompting LLMs and boosting methods. The interpretability and avoidance of finetuning are advantages over related works. The variety of experiments and comparisons provide a thorough investigation of the idea. The limitations show there is more progress to be made applying LLMs to tabular data.
