# [Big Tech influence over AI research revisited: memetic analysis of   attribution of ideas to affiliation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing discourse that Big Tech companies dominate AI research, but our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. 
- Prior studies oversimplify influence as the share of affiliations in papers, use limited datasets, and treat affiliation as binary (Big Tech vs Academia).

Objectives:
- Broaden and deepen understanding of Big Techâ€™s reach and power over AI research ideas (memes)
- Determine which AI ideas are predominantly driven by Big Tech 
- Compare papers with joint Big Tech-Academia affiliations to pure Big Tech/Academia papers

Methods:
- Performed network and memetic analysis on 166,455 AI papers from S2ORC and OpenAlex databases
- Used meme score to quantify replicative power of ideas 
- Introduced conditioned sticking factor to measure spread of ideas by affiliation
- Distinguished between pure and mixed academic/Big Tech affiliations 

Key Findings:
- Big Tech papers get more citations, but most cited papers have mixed Big Tech-Academia affiliations
- Mixed affiliation papers have distinct citation patterns from pure Big Tech/Academia papers  
- Most contagious ideas involve medical applications of ML and ML algorithms  
- Average contagiousness doesn't differ between affiliations, but specific ideas spread more via Big Tech  
- Data-related ideas especially contagious when mentioned by Big Tech companies

Implications:  
- Notion of Big Tech dominating AI research is overly simplistic
- More nuanced understanding of symbiosis between Academia and Big Tech needed
- This could foster a more balanced AI research landscape serving both societal welfare and scientific integrity

In summary, this comprehensive study challenges prevailing assumptions about Big Tech influence over AI research by employing novel memetic analysis revealing key differences in the spread of ideas based on academic vs industry affiliations. The findings advocate for a more thoughtful alliance between these key stakeholders.
