# [Text Is All You Need: Learning Language Representations for Sequential   Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13731)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective sequential recommendation system that can learn transferable representations to handle cold-start items and new domains?The key points are:- Existing sequential recommenders rely on item IDs and embeddings, which makes it difficult to generalize to new items or domains. - The authors propose a new method called Recformer that instead represents items based on their textual attributes, and models the sequential recommendation task as understanding and generating text sequences.- By representing items as text, the goal is to leverage the generalizability of language representations to make the model more transferable across domains and able to handle cold-start items.- The main hypothesis is that by unifying language understanding and sequential recommendation in a single model, Recformer will be able to learn more transferable representations and achieve better performance on new domains and cold-start items compared to existing methods.In summary, the central research question is how to develop a sequential recommender system that relies solely on language, with the hypothesis that this will enable more effective transfer learning and cold-start performance. The proposed Recformer model is their solution.
