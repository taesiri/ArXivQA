# [Cost-Adaptive Recourse Recommendation by Adaptive Preference Elicitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15073)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing methods for generating algorithmic recourses assume complete knowledge of the subject's cost function. However, in practice, subjects can have distinct preferences leading to incomplete information about the true underlying cost function. This makes it challenging to generate recourses tailored to each individual subject's preferences.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a two-step approach that integrates preference learning into the recourse generation framework:

1. Adaptive preference elicitation: An interactive question-answering framework is designed to sequentially refine the confidence set of possible Mahalanobis cost matrices that could represent the subject's preferences. Specifically, in each round, the algorithm carefully selects the most informative pairwise comparison question between two possible recourses to ask the subject. The subject's relative preference between the recourse options is used to update the confidence set. This is repeated for a predefined number of rounds.

2. Cost-adaptive recourse generation: Two methods are proposed to generate valid recourses while considering the entire confidence set of possible cost matrices obtained from preference elicitation: (i) A gradient-based method for differentiable ML models, and (ii) A graph-based method for black-box ML models. Both methods aim to ensure the recommended recourse is cost-efficient even under the worst-case cost matrix in the confidence set.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the problem of generating cost-adaptive recourses under incomplete preference information
- An adaptive preference elicitation framework to interactively learn subject's preferences
- Cost-adaptive extensions to gradient-based and graph-based recourse generation methods
- Extensions to handle inconsistencies in preference elicitation and generalization to multi-option questions
- Experiments on real datasets demonstrating improved cost-efficiency over existing methods

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions towards incorporating personal preferences into algorithmic recourse generation through an interactive elicitation approach. The proposed methods help provide more tailored and cost-efficient recourses to subjects.
