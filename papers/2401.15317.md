# [Floorplanning of VLSI by Mixed-Variable Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15317)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Floorplanning is a critical stage in physical design of VLSI circuits that determines the performance of chips. It is a complex multi-objective optimization problem with constraints that is challenging to solve for high-quality floorplans, especially for large-scale cases. Existing methods like combinatorial optimization models struggle with scalability while analytical methods face difficulties in handling non-smooth objectives and constraints.

Solution:
This paper proposes a mixed-variable formulation to model floorplanning as optimizing over both discrete orientation variables and continuous positioning variables. The key ideas are:

1) Use distribution evolutionary algorithm (DEA) to optimize discrete orientation variables. A novel DEA variant called DEA-PPM is introduced with specialized probability model and search mechanisms for strong global search ability.

2) Use conjugate subgradient algorithm (CSA) to optimize continuous coordinate variables. CSA can directly handle non-smooth objectives.

Two floorplanning algorithms are developed - FFA-CD for fixed-outline constraint and FA-GSS without fixed-outline. Key aspects include inheritance-based sampling to accelerate DEA convergence, alternating CSA optimization steps for coordinates given orientations, constraint graph based legalization, and golden section search to minimize floorplan area.


Contributions:

1) Novel mixed-variable formulation for VLSI floorplanning that combines strengths of discrete and continuous representations.

2) Specialized DEA and CSA tailored for exploration and handling constraints respectively.

3) Two floorplanning algorithms that can scale to large problem sizes for both fixed and variable outline scenarios.

4) Experimental results on standard benchmarks like GSRC showing state-of-the-art optimization performance over prior combinatorial and analytical methods in wirelength/area minimization and runtimes.

In summary, the paper presents an effective methodology to address key challenges in VLSI floorplanning using hybrid discrete-continuous modeling and search techniques. The proposed techniques demonstrate strong scalability due to their low complexities while achieving high solution quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes memetic algorithms to solve the VLSI floorplanning problem by formulating it as a mixed-variable optimization problem, where discrete orientation variables are optimized by a distribution evolutionary algorithm and continuous coordination variables are optimized by a conjugate sub-gradient algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It formulates the VLSI floorplanning problem as a mixed-variable optimization problem, where discrete variables represent module orientations and continuous variables represent coordinates of modules. 

2. It proposes a fixed-outline floorplanning algorithm (FFA-CD) based on conjugate sub-gradient algorithm (CSA) and distribution evolutionary algorithm based on a population of probability model (DEA-PPM). CSA optimizes the continuous coordinate variables and DEA-PPM evolves the discrete orientation variables.

3. It proposes a floorplanning algorithm with golden section strategy (FA-GSS) for floorplanning without fixed-outline constraints. FA-GSS narrows down the contour of the fixed outline using golden section search to minimize floorplan area.

4. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show the proposed FFA-CD and FA-GSS outperform existing algorithms like simulated annealing in wirelength optimization and runtime, especially for larger scale problems. The lower time complexity makes them suitable for large-scale floorplanning.

In summary, the key contribution is formulating floorplanning as a mixed variable optimization problem and proposing effective algorithms like FFA-CD and FA-GSS to solve it. The methods demonstrate better optimization performance and scalability than prior arts.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

8. Compare the time complexities of the proposed FFA-CD and FA-GSS methods versus other combinatorial optimization methods. Why are the proposed methods favorable for large problem sizes?

9. The parameters α, λ, μ balance the different optimization objectives in the cost functions. How should these parameters be set and adapted during the optimization process?
