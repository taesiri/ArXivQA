# [AI Safety: Necessary, but insufficient and possibly problematic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17419)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is a recent hype around "AI safety" promoted by governments and corporations, but it does not align well with previous AI research focused on social good. 
- The notion of "AI safety" is vague and lacks concrete mechanisms to ensure beneficial societal outcomes. It risks normalizing harmful AI.

Main Points:

- The AI research community has long worked on themes like ethics, fairness, accountability etc. But the current "AI safety" notion diverges from these themes.

- "AI safety" aligns with ensuring AI works as expected and is robust to hackers. But it does not mandate transparency or address structural harms from AI. 

- Lack of transparency requirements in "AI safety" enables opaque AI systems that can still cause harm to individuals and society.

- The EU's AI Act initially focused on safety of persons but later shifted emphasis to "AI safety", deprioritizing human welfare.

- Allowing harmful AI behind a veil of "safety" poses serious risks. "AI safety" as currently promoted may help big tech consolidate power unchecked.

Proposed Solution:

- True AI safety for societal good requires concrete transparency and accountability mechanisms, not just absence of visible issues.

- AI systems, objectives, and decisions should be inspectable. Responsibility should be attributable.

Key Contributions:

- Critically analyzes the emerging notion of AI safety promoted by powerful entities
- Contrasts it with past AI safety research focused on ethics and social good
- Warns of risks from opaque AI and normalization of structural harms
- Calls for transparency, accountability and commitment to human welfare

In summary, the paper provides an incisive critique of the evolving meaning of AI safety and warns that it may serve the interests of powerful groups rather than societal good. It argues for centering human dignity and welfare in any credible conception of AI safety.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper critically examines the recent hype around AI safety, arguing that it is insufficient and possibly problematic for addressing broader societal goals and risks normalizing structural harms from opaque AI systems optimized for profit rather than social good.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper provides a critical examination of the recent hype and enthusiasm around "AI safety" from governments and corporations. It analyzes what "AI safety" actually means based on how it is being operationalized in policy documents and debates, and argues that the dominant notion of AI safety emerging has an uneasy relationship with transparency and other concepts associated with societal good. 

Specifically, the paper argues that:

- The emerging concept of AI safety is insufficient to address structural harms and invisible biases caused by AI systems. It allows for opaque AI systems that can still cause harm to be passed off as "safe".

- AI safety enthusiasm has already started influencing AI regulations like the EU AI Act in concerning ways, potentially deprioritizing addressal of harms to individuals.

- The contours of the AI safety debate actually risk normalizing and providing a veneer for AI systems that advance exploitation, inequality, and harm.

In essence, the paper sounds a note of caution that the AI safety debate in its current form may be problematic and counterproductive for the goal of ensuring AI serves societal good in a broad sense. This is the key insight and contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it include:

- AI safety
- Structural harm
- Opaqueness 
- Transparency
- Societal good
- Regulation
- EU AI Act
- Misalignment
- Values
- Rights
- Trust
- Responsibility 
- Accountability
- Explainability

The paper critically examines the concept of "AI safety" that has recently gained global enthusiasm, especially among governments and corporations. It analyzes what AI safety actually entails and argues that the dominant notions associate it with avoiding unexpected or undesirable visible issues. 

However, the paper argues that AI safety has an uneasy relationship with transparency and other concepts linked to societal good. It may allow structural harms and oppression to continue under a veneer of safety. The paper also discusses the influence AI safety debates have had on regulatory efforts like the EU AI Act, potentially in concerning directions.

Overall, the paper associates AI safety with notions of misalignment, opaqueness, lack of transparency and accountability, and risks of normalizing structural harms - contrasting it with concepts of societal good, rights, trust and responsibility.
