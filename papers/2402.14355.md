# [Rule or Story, Which is a Better Commonsense Expression for Talking with   Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14355)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Incorporating commonsense into AI systems has been a long-standing challenge, due to the reporting bias (commonsense is rarely stated explicitly) and exposure bias (reasoning steps are often omitted) in human language.  
- Commonsense is typically represented as structured rules, but humans acquire and convey commonsense more implicitly through stories. This raises the question - which is a better expression for retrieving and leveraging commonsense from large language models (LLMs) - rules or stories?

Methodology:
- Systematically compare stories and rules for:
  - Retrieving commonsense knowledge from LLM memory
  - Leveraging commonsense to answer questions across 28 QA datasets
- Generation: Instruct LLM to generate stories and rules based on questions
- Evaluation: Assess confidence (perplexity) and accuracy of generated commonsense
- QA: Provide stories or rules as context for answering questions 

Key Findings:
- Stories result in more confident and accurate commonsense generation from LLM memory
- Stories more effective for reasoning about daily events, rules better for scientific questions
- Stories and rules complement each other - combining them improves QA accuracy 
- Identified two key issues in generated stories: hallucination and semantic drifting
- Proposed iterative self-supervised fine-tuning to improve quality of generated stories

Main Contributions:
- First study investigating effects of using stories vs rules to talk to LLMs about commonsense
- Shows stories are better for retrieving commonsense, rules complement for reasoning
- Reveals issues in commonsense stories generated by LLMs
- Proposes method to improve quality of commonsense stories from LLMs
- Emphasizes importance of using appropriate language to exploit commonsense abilities of LLMs

The summary covers the key points on the problem being addressed, the approach taken, major findings, and main contributions of the paper. It describes the comparisons between rules and stories for commonsense in a way that provides clarity to the reader on what this paper has presented.
