# [3DTopia: Large Text-to-3D Generation Model with Hybrid Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating high-quality 3D assets from text descriptions is challenging. Existing methods either use feed-forward networks which are fast but produce low quality outputs, or optimization-based methods which have high quality but are slow. There is a need to develop a text-to-3D generation system that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: 
The paper proposes a two-stage text-to-3D generation system called 3DTopia:

Stage 1: A text-conditioned tri-plane latent diffusion model is used to quickly generate a coarse 3D sample from the text description. This uses a compact tri-plane representation and latent conditioning to enable fast sampling.

Stage 2: The coarse 3D model from stage 1 is refined using 2D diffusion priors to improve the texture quality. This refinement has two steps - a latent space refinement using latent diffusion models, and a pixel space refinement using pixel-space diffusion models. 

The key novelty is using hybrid diffusion priors across both 3D and 2D spaces to get both speed and quality.

Contributions:
1) A two-stage text-to-3D pipeline combining the strengths of feed-forward and optimization methods.
2) Stage 1 tri-plane latent diffusion model for fast coarse model generation.
3) Stage 2 refinement using hybrid latent and pixel space 2D diffusion priors.
4) 3D dataset preparation including captioning and cleaning for Objaverse dataset.

The method is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing improved performance over existing text-to-3D approaches Point-E and Shap-E.
