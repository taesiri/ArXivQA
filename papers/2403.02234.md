# [3DTopia: Large Text-to-3D Generation Model with Hybrid Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generating high-quality 3D assets from text descriptions is challenging. Existing methods either use feed-forward networks which are fast but produce low quality outputs, or optimization-based methods which have high quality but are slow. There is a need to develop a text-to-3D generation system that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Method: 
The paper proposes a two-stage text-to-3D generation system called 3DTopia:

Stage 1: A text-conditioned tri-plane latent diffusion model is used to quickly generate a coarse 3D sample from the text description. This uses a compact tri-plane representation and latent conditioning to enable fast sampling.

Stage 2: The coarse 3D model from stage 1 is refined using 2D diffusion priors to improve the texture quality. This refinement has two steps - a latent space refinement using latent diffusion models, and a pixel space refinement using pixel-space diffusion models. 

The key novelty is using hybrid diffusion priors across both 3D and 2D spaces to get both speed and quality.

Contributions:
1) A two-stage text-to-3D pipeline combining the strengths of feed-forward and optimization methods.
2) Stage 1 tri-plane latent diffusion model for fast coarse model generation.
3) Stage 2 refinement using hybrid latent and pixel space 2D diffusion priors.
4) 3D dataset preparation including captioning and cleaning for Objaverse dataset.

The method is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing improved performance over existing text-to-3D approaches Point-E and Shap-E.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a two-stage text-to-3D generation system called 3DTopia that combines a fast tri-plane latent diffusion model for coarse shape generation with an optimization-based mesh refiner using hybrid 2D diffusion priors for high-quality texture refinement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a two-stage text-to-3D generation system called 3DTopia that uses hybrid diffusion priors to enable both fast prototyping and high-quality 3D generation. 

2) As the first stage, it explores a text-conditioned tri-plane latent diffusion model that can quickly generate coarse 3D samples. 

3) As the second stage, it uses 2D diffusion priors to further refine the texture of the coarse 3D models from the first stage through both latent space and pixel space optimization.

4) It proposes a 3D captioning and cleaning pipeline to prepare a large text-3D paired dataset from Objaverse, contributing 360K captions and a high-quality subset of 135K 3D objects.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed two-stage 3DTopia system that combines the strengths of feed-forward 3D generation networks and optimization-based methods to achieve both speed and quality for text-to-3D generation. The key novelty lies in using hybrid diffusion priors in the two stages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Text-to-3D generation - The paper focuses on generating 3D assets from text prompts.

- Two-stage system - The proposed method, 3DTopia, consists of two stages - a text-guided latent diffusion model for fast prototyping, and a refinement stage using 2D diffusion priors. 

- Hybrid diffusion priors - The two-stage system utilizes both 3D and 2D diffusion priors to generate high-quality 3D assets.

- Tri-plane representation - The first stage uses a tri-plane representation to parameterize the 3D assets, which offers a good balance between efficiency and quality.

- Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) - The second refinement stage employs SDS with 2D diffusion models to further improve the texture quality.

- Latent diffusion model (LDM) - The first stage model is a tri-plane latent diffusion model built on a variational autoencoder.

- 3D captioning - An automated 3D captioning pipeline is proposed to generate detailed captions at scale from the Objaverse dataset.

- Data cleaning - A cleaned, high-quality subset is extracted from Objaverse and used to fine-tune the model.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a two-stage text-to-3D generation system. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having a two-stage system compared to a single-stage system? How do the two stages complement each other?

2) The first stage uses a tri-plane latent diffusion model. Why was tri-plane representation chosen over other 3D representations like voxels, meshes, or neural radiance fields? What are the trade-offs? 

3) The second stage utilizes an optimization-based refinement with hybrid 2D diffusion priors. What is the motivation behind using a 2D diffusion prior for a 3D task? Why use both latent-space and pixel-space diffusion models?

4) The paper mentions using classifier-free guidance during diffusion model training. How does this work and why is it useful? What improvements did it bring?

5) What modifications were made to the noise schedules of the diffusion models to make them resolution-aware? Why is this important?

6) The 3D dataset is cleaned and filtered before use. What are the criteria used for filtering and why are they important? What proportion of data is filtered out? 

7) What is the Captify pipeline used for 3D captioning? Why use a multi-modal model compared to a single-modal model? How do the captions compare to prior work?

8) During mesh refinement, why is it necessary to first optimize the hash texture before applying score distillation sampling? Does the order matter?

9) What quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the different components and the overall pipeline? What do the results indicate about the method's strengths?

10) What are some current limitations of the method? How might the two-stage architecture limit the model's ability to handle complex text prompts? What future work could address this?
