# [Early stopping by correlating online indicators in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02513)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks are prone to overfitting due to their high complexity and large parameter spaces. This leads to poor generalization performance on new data.
- Existing regularization techniques like early stopping can help address overfitting, but most early stopping criteria are unreliable or require extensive tuning. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new early stopping technique called COI that exploits the correlation over time between multiple independent online indicators associated with different stopping criteria.  
- Online indicators are Boolean functions that evaluate if overfitting is occurring based on a "canary" function like cross-validation performance.
- COI stops training when a subset of indicators highly correlate, signalling broader agreement on overfitting. This provides more reliability than individual criteria.

Key Contributions:
- Provides a formal basis using the "principle of common cause" for interpreting agreement between independent stopping criteria as a reliable overfitting indicator.
- Introduces the COI technique for early stopping that correlates multiple criteria over time with tunable correlation and confidence thresholds.
- Evaluates COI on complex NLP parsing tasks, showing improved generalization and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods with high stability.
- Demonstrates potential of correlating decision criteria for stability and preventing overfitting during neural network training.

In summary, the paper formalizes and introduces a novel early stopping approach called COI that correlates multiple independent criteria to reliably detect overfitting in neural networks. Experiments on parsing demonstrate improved efficiency, effectiveness and robustness over existing methods.
