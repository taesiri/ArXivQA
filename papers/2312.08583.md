# [ZeroQuant(4+2): Redefining LLMs Quantization with a New FP6-Centric   Strategy for Diverse Generative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08583)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper examines quantization methods for large language models (LLMs), highlighting issues with current 4-bit quantization approaches like GPTQ. They broaden the evaluation scope beyond just zero-shot tasks to include code generation and summarization. They find INT4 quantization can significantly underperform in these generative tasks, especially for smaller models. They show FP6 quantization, even with coarse grain and simple round-to-nearest mapping, consistently matches full precision model performance across tasks and sizes. They propose a "4+2" FP6 format to enable efficient system integration, attaining similar latency as state-of-the-art INT4 methods. Their FP6 approach provides accuracy and versatility exceeding INT4 limits, while overcoming prior FP6 deployment barriers. It offers a promising solution for real-world LLM quantization across diverse applications.
