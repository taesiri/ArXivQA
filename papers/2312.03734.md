# [Conditional Prompt Tuning for Multimodal Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Transferring unimodal foundation models for multimodal downstream tasks is challenging due to (1) the diversity of model architectures across modalities complicates the design of an optimal fusion approach, and (2) the limited availability of multimodal data makes fine-tuning foundation models inefficient. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a conditional prompt tuning method for multimodal fusion that is architecture-agnostic and parameter-efficient. The key ideas are:

(1) Adopt a sequential pipeline to segregate architectural details of modalities. Extract features from one modality first to guide the prompting of the other modality.

(2) Augment vanilla prompt tuning with two additional prompt types: (a) dynamic prompt that captures instance-level shifts, (b) mapped prompt that injects fine-grained information from the complementary modality.  

(3) Introduce Mixture of Prompt Experts (MoPE) to generate instance-specific dynamic prompts. A pool of prompt experts is maintained and a learned router predicts routing scores to weigh experts for each instance.

(4) Add an importance loss to regularize routing and avoid degenerated solutions.

Main Contributions:

- A conditional prompt tuning approach for multimodal fusion that is architecture-agnostic and achieves superior parameter efficiency.

- The proposal of augmenting static prompts with dynamic and mapped prompts to capture global, instance, and complementary information.

- The design of MoPE to enhance expressiveness of prompting and scale model capacity without increasing sequence length.

- State-of-the-art results on multiple datasets while using only 0.7% of the parameters required by fine-tuning baselines.

In summary, the paper presents an effective way to combine unimodal models for multimodal downstream tasks via prompt tuning, with high flexibility and parameter-efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a conditional prompt tuning method for multimodal fusion that uses representations from one modality to guide the mixture-of-experts based prompting of the other modality, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high parameter efficiency and modularity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing to augment the vanilla prompt tuning with the dynamic and mapped prompt, utilizing the paired modality as a prior, to better adapt the pretrained model to each instance.

2. Elaborating a mixture of prompt expert (MoPE) design for dynamic prompt, which scales up the expressiveness of prompt tuning for transfer learning. 

3. Studying the effect of a regularization term for avoiding degenerated expert routing in MoPE.

4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on three multimodal datasets (UPMC_Food-101, SNLI-VE and MM-IMDB) for multimodal fusion, while being highly parameter-efficient compared to finetuning methods.

In summary, the main contribution is a conditional prompting method with a mixture of prompt experts to achieve effective and modular multimodal fusion in a parameter-efficient way, outperforming existing prompt-tuning baselines.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes three types of prompts - static, dynamic, and mapped prompts. Can you explain the purpose and functionality of each prompt type? How do they complement each other?

2. The mixture of prompt experts (MoPE) method is introduced to generate the dynamic prompts. Can you explain the components of MoPE including the prompt experts, router, and routing process? How does MoPE enhance the expressiveness of prompt tuning? 

3. The paper studies the effect of using dense routing versus sparse routing in MoPE. What were the differences observed? Why does dense routing perform better for prompt tuning?

4. An additional importance loss is proposed to regularize the expert routing. What is the purpose of this loss and how does it affect expert utilization over time? Please explain its formulation. 

5. What are the limitations of standard prompt tuning methods that motivated the proposals in this paper? How does conditional prompt tuning augmented with MoPE address those limitations?

6. How does the method exhibit modularity across choice of architectures, pretraining schemes, and transfer learning techniques? Provide some examples from the results.

7. The method adopts a sequential pipeline for multimodal fusion. What are the benefits of this over other fusion paradigms? Does it have any limitations?

8. How does the performance of conditional prompt tuning scale with increased training data compared to standard prompt tuning and fine-tuning baselines?

9. Could the method be extended for other multimodal tasks such as segmentation or detection that may require spatial information? What changes would be needed?
