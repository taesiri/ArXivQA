# [Designing Silicon Brains using LLM: Leveraging ChatGPT for Automated   Description of a Spiking Neuron Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10920)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper explores using ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), to automatically generate Verilog code for a spiking neural network chip from natural language prompts. Spiking neural networks are unconventional computing architectures inspired by biological brains. 

The authors successfully prompted ChatGPT to generate Verilog code for:

1) A leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neuron module. This is a simple but commonly used spiking neuron model. ChatGPT produced a basic functioning module, but it contained syntax errors and logical flaws in handling numeric overflow that required several follow-up prompts to fix. 

2) A small 2-layer fully connected spiking neural network module instantiating multiple LIF neurons. The initial ChatGPT-generated code had array declaration issues and neuron instantiation syntax problems that revealed ChatGPT's unfamiliarity with Verilog. After many iterative follow-up prompts, a working network module was achieved.

3) An SPI peripheral module to allow programming neuron/network parameters. The module had subtle syntax mixups between Verilog and SystemVerilog and logical errors in the SPI state machine that again highlighted ChatGPT's lack of practical Verilog experience.

4) A top-level module integrating the above components. This had only minor issues that were easily fixed.

The authors submitted the final ChatGPT-generated design for fabrication in a 130nm process. Despite achieving a functional design, they conclude that ChatGPT's output quality and practical Verilog knowledge is currently lacking. The need for an expert user to guide extensive corrections and workarounds greatly reduces ChatGPT's viability as a true high-level abstraction tool for hardware design today. However, they believe conversational interfaces have strong potential for increasing design efficiency in the future.
