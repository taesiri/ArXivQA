# [Transformers are Meta-Reinforcement Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06614)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research question addressed in this paper is whether transformer architectures, which have shown great success in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, can also be effective for meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL). Specifically, the paper proposes that two key capabilities of transformers - handling long sequences and possessing context-dependent weights from the attention mechanism - are well-suited for the core requirements of meta-RL agents.Meta-RL agents need to be able to infer the task from observing sequences of trajectories. Transformers are designed to model dependencies in long sequences.Meta-RL agents also need to quickly adapt their policies to new tasks, which can be achieved through the context-dependent weights of the transformer attention mechanism.In summary, the central hypothesis is that transformers can be an effective architecture for meta-RL by leveraging these two key capabilities. The paper presents a transformer-based meta-RL agent called TrMRL and empirically evaluates its performance on continuous control tasks to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is proposing TrMRL, a memory-based meta-RL agent that uses a transformer architecture to implement a memory reinstatement mechanism. Specifically:- TrMRL uses the transformer's ability to handle long sequences to identify tasks from trajectories. - It uses the context-dependent weights from self-attention as a fast adaptation strategy to adapt the policy to new tasks.- It recursively associates recent working memories through the transformer layers to build an episodic memory that provides context for the policy.- It shows comparable or better performance on continuous control tasks compared to meta-RL baselines like PEARL, MAML, RL^2, and VariBAD in terms of meta-training, fast adaptation, and out-of-distribution generalization.So in summary, the key ideas are using the transformer architecture to implement memory-based meta-RL via reinstatement, and showing this achieves good results on benchmark tasks compared to prior meta-RL algorithms.
