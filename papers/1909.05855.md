# [Towards Scalable Multi-domain Conversational Agents: The Schema-Guided   Dialogue Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05855)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How to develop scalable and robust conversational agents that can support a large number of services across multiple domains, including the ability to handle new/unseen services and domains. The key challenges outlined are:- Existing conversational agents and datasets are limited to a small number of domains and a fixed ontology/schema per domain. However, real-world virtual assistants need to support many services across a large number of domains.- There is little to no training data available for new services that need to be integrated. So the agents need the ability to generalize to new services and domains in a zero-shot manner.- Services keep getting frequently updated with new intents, slots, APIs etc. The agents need to be robust to such schema changes without requiring re-training.To address these challenges, the central hypothesis seems to be:- A single unified model can be trained to support services across multiple domains in a scalable manner by leveraging their schema information. The model can generalize to unseen services by using semantic representations of intents and slots.The paper introduces a large multi-domain dialogue dataset called Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) to test this hypothesis. It also presents a prototype model for zero-shot dialogue state tracking under this schema-guided paradigm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset and the proposal of the schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems. Specifically:- The paper introduces the SGD dataset, which is claimed to be the largest public task-oriented dialogue corpus. It contains over 16,000 multi-domain dialogues spanning 16 domains. The dataset highlights challenges with scaling to a large number of services and domains.- The paper proposes the schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue. In this paradigm, the dialogue system is given the schema for each service, which specifies the intents, slots, and their descriptions. The model then makes predictions over this dynamic set of intents and slots. This allows handling new services and APIs without needing additional training data.- Based on the schema-guided approach, the authors present a model for zero-shot dialogue state tracking. By using BERT, their model can generalize to unseen services while remaining competitive on existing datasets like MultiWOZ.In summary, the SGD dataset and the schema-guided dialogue modeling approach are the main contributions aimed at improving the scalability of task-oriented dialogue systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in multi-domain conversational AI:- Dataset Scale: With over 16,000 dialogues, the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset presented in this paper is much larger than previous multi-domain dialogue datasets like MultiWOZ (8,438 dialogues), FRAMES (1,369 dialogues) and M2M (1,500 dialogues). The larger and more diverse dataset allows for better training and evaluation of models.- Multi-Domain Coverage: While previous datasets covered 2-7 domains, SGD covers 16 domains with a total of 26 services, making it significantly broader. This tests models' ability to scale across a large number of domains.- Unseen Services: A key focus of this paper is handling new/unseen services that the model was not trained on. The test sets in SGD contain unseen services and domains, unlike MultiWOZ and others. This evaluates generalization.- Task Definition: Previous works have mostly assumed a fixed ontology per domain. But SGD defines each service via a custom schema, better reflecting real-world variability in APIs. The schema-guided paradigm handles dynamic APIs.- State Tracking Model: This paper presents a model for zero-shot dialogue state tracking using BERT, evaluated on SGD and other datasets. The model is competitive on existing datasets, while showing ability for zero-shot generalization.In summary, this paper pushes research towards more diverse, large-scale multi-domain dialogue learning applicable to real-world virtual assistants. The dataset, task formulation and model presented help move in this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing better user simulators that can generate more natural dialogue flows and cover a more diverse range of scenarios. The authors note some limitations of their current simulation-based framework for dialogue collection. Improving the user simulator could further enhance the quality and coverage of synthetically generated datasets.- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques for zero-shot dialogue state tracking. The authors present a simple prototype model but mention there is significant room for improvement.- Evaluating the schema-guided modeling paradigm on a wider range of tasks beyond just dialogue state tracking, such as natural language generation. - Applying the schema-guided approach to other domains beyond task-oriented dialogues, such as open-domain conversations. This could help improve generalization even further.- Developing better evaluation metrics and benchmarks to assess performance, especially on unseen services and APIs. The authors acknowledge that evaluating models like theirs poses challenges.- Experimenting with different techniques for obtaining semantic representations of intents and slots from their descriptions. The authors use BERT in a simple manner currently.- Incorporating knowledge-bases, external memory modules, and other knowledge sources to improve knowledge sharing and zero-shot generalization.In summary, the main future directions are developing better simulation techniques for data collection, exploring new models and training methods, generalizing the approach to other tasks and domains, and improving evaluation. Overall the authors identify many interesting open problems to build truly scalable multi-domain dialogue agents.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset, which contains over 16,000 multi-domain dialogues spanning 16 domains. This makes SGD the largest public task-oriented dialogue dataset. The data was collected using a simulation framework which interacts with services implemented using schemas. The dialogues were then paraphrased by crowdworkers to make them more natural while preserving annotations. The dataset highlights challenges like handling a large number of services and domains, generalization to unseen domains, and dealing with differences between service schemas. The paper also proposes a schema-guided paradigm for building virtual assistants. In this approach, the assistant uses a single model which takes as input the schema for the target service or API. This allows easy integration of new services without retraining, zero-shot transfer, and robustness to changes in the schemas. The authors implement a prototype dialogue state tracking model under this paradigm. The model utilizes BERT embeddings and achieves competitive results on existing datasets like MultiWOZ 2.1 while also performing well on unseen services. The SGD dataset and ideas like schema-guided modeling are useful steps towards building large-scale multi-domain virtual assistants.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems that can support a large number of services with minimal training data. The key idea is that instead of training separate models for each service, a single model is trained that takes the schema for a service as input. The schema describes the intents, slots, and descriptions for that service. By conditioning on this schema, the model can dynamically adapt to new services not seen during training. The authors present a prototype model for zero-shot dialogue state tracking under this paradigm. The model uses BERT to encode utterance pairs and the schema elements. It then makes predictions over the schema elements, such as predicting the active intent and requested slots. By leveraging large pretrained language models like BERT and operating over the schema space, the model is able to generalize to unseen services in a zero-shot manner while remaining competitive on existing datasets like MultiWOZ. The proposed schema-guided dialogue dataset contains over 16K conversations spanning 26 services in 16 domains. It serves as an effective testbed for the paradigm and model.
