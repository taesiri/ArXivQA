# Towards Scalable Multi-domain Conversational Agents: The Schema-Guided   Dialogue Dataset

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How to develop scalable and robust conversational agents that can support a large number of services across multiple domains, including the ability to handle new/unseen services and domains. The key challenges outlined are:- Existing conversational agents and datasets are limited to a small number of domains and a fixed ontology/schema per domain. However, real-world virtual assistants need to support many services across a large number of domains.- There is little to no training data available for new services that need to be integrated. So the agents need the ability to generalize to new services and domains in a zero-shot manner.- Services keep getting frequently updated with new intents, slots, APIs etc. The agents need to be robust to such schema changes without requiring re-training.To address these challenges, the central hypothesis seems to be:- A single unified model can be trained to support services across multiple domains in a scalable manner by leveraging their schema information. The model can generalize to unseen services by using semantic representations of intents and slots.The paper introduces a large multi-domain dialogue dataset called Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) to test this hypothesis. It also presents a prototype model for zero-shot dialogue state tracking under this schema-guided paradigm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset and the proposal of the schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue systems. Specifically:- The paper introduces the SGD dataset, which is claimed to be the largest public task-oriented dialogue corpus. It contains over 16,000 multi-domain dialogues spanning 16 domains. The dataset highlights challenges with scaling to a large number of services and domains.- The paper proposes the schema-guided paradigm for task-oriented dialogue. In this paradigm, the dialogue system is given the schema for each service, which specifies the intents, slots, and their descriptions. The model then makes predictions over this dynamic set of intents and slots. This allows handling new services and APIs without needing additional training data.- Based on the schema-guided approach, the authors present a model for zero-shot dialogue state tracking. By using BERT, their model can generalize to unseen services while remaining competitive on existing datasets like MultiWOZ.In summary, the SGD dataset and the schema-guided dialogue modeling approach are the main contributions aimed at improving the scalability of task-oriented dialogue systems.
