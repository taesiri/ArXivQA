# [LCEN: A Novel Feature Selection Algorithm for Nonlinear, Interpretable   Machine Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17120)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Interpretable machine learning models are important for critical applications like medicine and aviation, but commonly used interpretable models like LASSO and Elastic Net (EN) are limited to linear predictions and have poor feature selection capabilities. There is a need for nonlinear, interpretable models with strong feature selection.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes the LASSO-Clip-EN (LCEN) algorithm to create nonlinear, interpretable models with strong feature selection. Key aspects:

- Expands the feature space to include non-linear terms like polynomials, logarithms etc. The degree of expansions is a hyperparameter.

- Applies LASSO for initial feature selection and model fitting. Includes a "clip" step to remove tiny coefficients.

- Refits the model using Elastic Net to handle correlations better. Applies "clip" again.

Main Contributions:

- Tested on artificial and real datasets. Shows LCEN can reliably rediscover physical laws and relationships from data.

- Compares to LASSO, EN, and neural networks on real datasets. LCEN reaches comparable or better accuracy while using far fewer features. For example, on a diesel dataset, LCEN uses 37 features versus 299 for EN but has similar test error.

- Demonstrates interpretability benefits. The diesel dataset model directly shows which input wavelengths are most important. A 3-variable LCEN model on an abalone dataset has only a 2.2% higher error than a 9-variable dense model.

- Provides an algorithm and tool for practitioners to create nonlinear interpretable models easily. Can assist in refined data collection and model improvements in applications like materials science.

In summary, the paper presents LCEN that makes nonlinear, high-accuracy machine learning models accessible and interpretable by flexibly expanding features and including strong regularization, enabling new applications.
