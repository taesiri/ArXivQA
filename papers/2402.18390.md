## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Microgrids face challenges with their communication networks such as delays, cyberattacks, and link outages which impact stability and reliability.  
- Existing power and data co-transfer technologies like Talkative Power Communication have limitations in efficiency, scalability, and ability to traverse isolation stages.
- New intrinsic communication methods are needed among converters to address these issues.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose using neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for semantic communication among converters. 
- SNNs operate on sparse, binary spikes allowing energy-efficient computation and online training.
- Leverage power flow measurements between converters as communication channel to train SNNs to estimate remote measurements.
- Employ event-driven sampling to collect sparse data corresponding to disturbances and translate to spikes for SNN training.

Main Contributions:
- First application of neuromorphic computing for coordinated control of microgrids.
- Tailor SNN as a grid-edge inference technology using local power measurements.
- Propose novel communication protocol based on "publish-subscribe" architecture using power flows.  
- Use semantic events tied to converter dynamics and turn into spikes for online SNN training.  
- Show computational and efficiency benefits over ANNs and RNNs.
- Eliminate cyber layer issues like attacks, delays, outages.
- Overcome limitations of other co-transfer technologies in traversing isolation stages.
- Demonstrate versatility across different topologies, objectives and voltage levels.

In summary, the paper pioneers a new paradigm for intrinsic, efficient and reliable communication amongst converters in microgrids using neuromorphic intelligence while eliminating conventional cyber layer.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using neuromorphic computing with spiking neural networks for low-power semantic communication between converters in microgrids to enable coordinated control and remote estimation solely based on power flow measurements, eliminating the need for a dedicated communication infrastructure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel application of neuromorphic computing using spiking neural networks (SNNs) for the coordinated control of microgrids. This allows energy-efficient communication and control between converters in the microgrid using only the power flows, without needing a separate communication network.

2) It develops a method to translate physical events and disturbances in the microgrid, such as load changes or line outages, into semantic events that trigger sparse data collection. These events are encoded into spikes to train the SNNs online using spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP).

3) Compared to other neural networks like ANNs and RNNs, the SNN approach is shown to be much more energy-efficient for the control and communication application. Experiments demonstrate accurate estimation of remote measurements for coordination.

4) The proposed approach eliminates the need for a cyber layer, avoiding associated issues like communication delays, cyber attacks, etc. It also overcomes limitations of other power-data co-transfer methods regarding efficiency and scalability across voltage levels and converter stages.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and demonstration of a novel neuromorphic computing concept for intrinsic communication and control in microgrids, with advantages in aspects like energy efficiency, cyber security, and flexibility.
