# [Neuromorphic Event-Driven Semantic Communication in Microgrids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Microgrids face challenges with their communication networks such as delays, cyberattacks, and link outages which impact stability and reliability.  
- Existing power and data co-transfer technologies like Talkative Power Communication have limitations in efficiency, scalability, and ability to traverse isolation stages.
- New intrinsic communication methods are needed among converters to address these issues.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose using neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for semantic communication among converters. 
- SNNs operate on sparse, binary spikes allowing energy-efficient computation and online training.
- Leverage power flow measurements between converters as communication channel to train SNNs to estimate remote measurements.
- Employ event-driven sampling to collect sparse data corresponding to disturbances and translate to spikes for SNN training.

Main Contributions:
- First application of neuromorphic computing for coordinated control of microgrids.
- Tailor SNN as a grid-edge inference technology using local power measurements.
- Propose novel communication protocol based on "publish-subscribe" architecture using power flows.  
- Use semantic events tied to converter dynamics and turn into spikes for online SNN training.  
- Show computational and efficiency benefits over ANNs and RNNs.
- Eliminate cyber layer issues like attacks, delays, outages.
- Overcome limitations of other co-transfer technologies in traversing isolation stages.
- Demonstrate versatility across different topologies, objectives and voltage levels.

In summary, the paper pioneers a new paradigm for intrinsic, efficient and reliable communication amongst converters in microgrids using neuromorphic intelligence while eliminating conventional cyber layer.
