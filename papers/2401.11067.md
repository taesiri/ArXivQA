# [Make-A-Shape: a Ten-Million-scale 3D Shape Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11067)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Training large-scale generative models for 3D shapes faces significant challenges compared to 2D images, including substantially more input variables to model, data handling complexities for streaming and storage, and determining a suitable 3D representation that achieves high quality while maintaining representation compactness for efficient training. Most current 3D generative models have been limited in scale and quality.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new 3D representation called the "wavelet-tree representation" to encode high-resolution signed distance fields into a compact set of informative wavelet coefficients. It retains both coarse and detail coefficients using a subband coefficient filtering scheme to exploit coefficient relationships. 

To enable effective generative modeling, the paper presents:
(1) A subband coefficient packing scheme to transform the irregular wavelet-tree structure into a regular grid for compatibility with diffusion models. 
(2) A subband adaptive training strategy to selectively focus on important detail coefficients while balancing shape information across scales.
(3) Mechanisms to condition the generative model on various input modalities like images, point clouds and voxels.

Together, these technical contributions enable training a generative model called "Make-A-Shape" on over 10 million 3D shapes. The model can generate high quality shapes in just a few seconds.

Main Contributions:
- Wavelet-tree representation to compactly encode shapes with minimal information loss 
- Subband coefficient filtering to retain informative detail coefficients
- Subband coefficient packing to transform representation into diffusible format 
- Subband adaptive training strategy to balance learning of coarse and detail coefficients
- Conditional generation mechanisms for images, point clouds, voxels etc.
- "Make-A-Shape" generative model trained on 10 million shapes, achieving state-of-the-art performance

The proposed techniques overcome limitations of prior arts and allow high quality shape generation on a vast scale with minimal resource demands. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate superiority over existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Make-A-Shape, a novel 3D generative framework that leverages a compact yet expressive wavelet-tree representation and an adaptive training strategy to enable efficient training of a diffusion model on over 10 million shapes, achieving high-quality 3D shape generation under various conditions in just 2 seconds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of Make-A-Shape (MAS), a novel 3D generative framework capable of training on over 10 million 3D shapes. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) A new 3D representation called the wavelet-tree representation, which can effectively encode high-resolution SDFs into a compact set of wavelet coefficients with minimal information loss. This allows efficient large-scale training.

2) Techniques to transform the wavelet-tree representation into a format compatible with diffusion models, called the diffusible wavelet-tree representation. This includes subband coefficient packing to rearrange coefficients into a regular grid for generation.  

3) A subband adaptive training strategy that selectively focuses on important wavelet coefficients to balance shape information across scales and encourage learning of both structural and detailed aspects.

4) Extension to conditional generation using various input modalities like images, point clouds and voxels by employing suitable encoders and injection mechanisms.

5) State-of-the-art quantitative results on tasks like image/point/voxel to shape generation. The model also enables applications like unconditional shape sampling and shape completion in a zero-shot manner.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of representations, network architectures and training strategies that together enable a 3D generative framework to be trained at an unprecedented scale of 10 million shapes, while generating high quality results in few seconds.
