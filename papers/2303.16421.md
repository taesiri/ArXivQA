# [ChatGPT is a Knowledgeable but Inexperienced Solver: An Investigation of   Commonsense Problem in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) Can GPTs effectively answer commonsense questions? 

2) Are GPTs knowledgeable in commonsense? 

3) Are GPTs aware of the underlying commonsense knowledge for answering a specific question? 

4) Can GPTs effectively leverage commonsense for answering questions?

The authors seem to be evaluating and analyzing the commonsense abilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. In particular, they are investigating whether these models can accurately answer commonsense questions, if they actually possess and can generate the necessary commonsense knowledge, and whether they can effectively identify and utilize the relevant commonsense knowledge needed to answer specific questions. 

The overarching goal seems to be assessing the strengths and limitations of current LLMs when it comes to representing and reasoning about commonsense knowledge across different domains (physical, social, temporal, etc.). The authors design experiments using commonsense QA datasets to analyze these capabilities of ChatGPT.

In summary, the central research questions focus on evaluating ChatGPT's abilities in: 1) answering commonsense questions, 2) generating/possessing commonsense knowledge, 3) identifying necessary knowledge for questions, and 4) leveraging commonsense knowledge for reasoning and QA. The experiments aim to provide insights into these aspects to determine how well LLMs can currently perform on commonsense tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is conducting a detailed investigation and analysis of the commonsense abilities of large language models, specifically ChatGPT. The key points are:

- The paper evaluates ChatGPT's ability to answer commonsense questions across 11 datasets covering 8 knowledge domains. It finds that ChatGPT can achieve high accuracy on most datasets, but still struggles with certain types of knowledge like social and temporal reasoning. 

- The paper assesses whether ChatGPT can identify the necessary commonsense knowledge to answer specific questions. Through manual evaluation, it shows ChatGPT struggles to precisely pinpoint the relevant knowledge, often generating high noise.

- The paper evaluates whether ChatGPT contains accurate commonsense knowledge by querying it with prompts based on the identified knowledge. It finds ChatGPT can generate correct descriptions for most knowledge, indicating it is knowledgeable.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates the commonsense abilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT by conducting a series of experiments on 11 commonsense QA datasets covering 8 domains. First, the accuracy of LLMs on answering commonsense questions is evaluated. Then, to assess whether models are aware of the necessary knowledge, they are asked to generate descriptions of the required commonsense knowledge for answering sample questions, and the quality of the generated knowledge is manually evaluated. Next, the models' possessed commonsense knowledge is evaluated by manually constructing knowledge-querying prompts based on the generated knowledge descriptions, and assessing the accuracy of the models' responses. Finally, the ability to leverage commonsense knowledge in reasoning is tested by providing the generated knowledge back to the models as context when answering the original questions again. The models' performance changes are analyzed to evaluate their reasoning abilities. Through these experiments spanning question answering, knowledge awareness, knowledge possession, and reasoning, the paper provides a comprehensive investigation and analysis of LLMs' commonsense capabilities.
