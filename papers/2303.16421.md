# ChatGPT is a Knowledgeable but Inexperienced Solver: An Investigation of   Commonsense Problem in Large Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can GPTs effectively answer commonsense questions? 2) Are GPTs knowledgeable in commonsense? 3) Are GPTs aware of the underlying commonsense knowledge for answering a specific question? 4) Can GPTs effectively leverage commonsense for answering questions?The authors seem to be evaluating and analyzing the commonsense abilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. In particular, they are investigating whether these models can accurately answer commonsense questions, if they actually possess and can generate the necessary commonsense knowledge, and whether they can effectively identify and utilize the relevant commonsense knowledge needed to answer specific questions. The overarching goal seems to be assessing the strengths and limitations of current LLMs when it comes to representing and reasoning about commonsense knowledge across different domains (physical, social, temporal, etc.). The authors design experiments using commonsense QA datasets to analyze these capabilities of ChatGPT.In summary, the central research questions focus on evaluating ChatGPT's abilities in: 1) answering commonsense questions, 2) generating/possessing commonsense knowledge, 3) identifying necessary knowledge for questions, and 4) leveraging commonsense knowledge for reasoning and QA. The experiments aim to provide insights into these aspects to determine how well LLMs can currently perform on commonsense tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is conducting a detailed investigation and analysis of the commonsense abilities of large language models, specifically ChatGPT. The key points are:- The paper evaluates ChatGPT's ability to answer commonsense questions across 11 datasets covering 8 knowledge domains. It finds that ChatGPT can achieve high accuracy on most datasets, but still struggles with certain types of knowledge like social and temporal reasoning. - The paper assesses whether ChatGPT can identify the necessary commonsense knowledge to answer specific questions. Through manual evaluation, it shows ChatGPT struggles to precisely pinpoint the relevant knowledge, often generating high noise.- The paper evaluates whether ChatGPT contains accurate commonsense knowledge by querying it with prompts based on the identified knowledge. It finds ChatGPT can generate correct descriptions for most knowledge, indicating it is knowledgeable. - The paper tests whether ChatGPT can leverage generated knowledge to answer questions. It discovers providing the knowledge as context does not significantly improve ChatGPT's reasoning and answering abilities.In summary, the key contribution is providing a comprehensive evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT's commonsense capabilities through multiple experiments. The paper demonstrates that while knowledgeable, ChatGPT is an inexperienced problem solver when it comes to effectively using commonsense knowledge for reasoning and question answering.
