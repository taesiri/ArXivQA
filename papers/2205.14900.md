# [FRAug: Tackling Federated Learning with Non-IID Features via   Representation Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14900)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is: 

How can we develop an effective federated learning algorithm that handles non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) features across clients?

The key hypothesis is that generating synthetic embeddings tailored to each client's feature distribution can help improve model performance under federated learning with heterogeneous feature distributions.

To summarize, the main goal of this paper is to propose a federated learning method that can handle the challenging but practical problem of non-IID feature distributions across clients, where clients have the same label space but different underlying feature distributions. The proposed approach, called Federated Representation Augmentation (FRAug), tackles this issue by augmenting each client's feature space with synthesized embeddings adapted to that client's specific feature distribution.
