# [Unsupervised Image Denoising in Real-World Scenarios via   Self-Collaboration Parallel Generative Adversarial Branches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06776)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an unsupervised real-world image denoising method that can surpass the performance limitations of conventional GAN-based unsupervised frameworks without significantly increasing model complexity or inference time?The key points are:- Unsupervised image denoising using generative adversarial networks (GANs) is promising for handling real-world noise where paired training data is unavailable. - However, existing GAN-based approaches have difficulty surpassing certain performance limitations.- The paper proposes a self-collaboration (SC) strategy to boost performance of a GAN-based denoiser without altering model architecture or increasing inference complexity.- They also propose a baseline GAN framework called PGabNet with parallel branches and complementary constraints to ensure stability. - Integrating SC strategy with PGabNet gives state-of-the-art unsupervised denoising performance on benchmarks.So in summary, the central research question is how to substantially improve GAN-based unsupervised denoising performance without significantly changing the model or increasing inference time. The proposed solutions are the SC strategy and the PGabNet baseline framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel self-collaboration (SC) strategy for image denoising methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). 2. It introduces a strong baseline called Parallel Generative Adversarial Branches (PGabNet) for unsupervised real-world image denoising. PGabNet uses parallel branches with complementary "self-synthesis" and "unpaired-synthesis" constraints.3. When applied to PGabNet, the proposed SC strategy creates a self-boosting framework called SCPGabNet that allows the denoiser to continuously improve itself. This enables SCPGabNet to significantly outperform conventional GAN-based approaches without increasing inference complexity.4. Extensive experiments show SCPGabNet achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods on benchmark datasets like SIDD and DND, even surpassing some supervised methods. The effectiveness of the SC strategy is also validated by applying it to other networks.In summary, the key contribution is the novel SC strategy that empowers GAN-based denoisers to exceed inherent performance limitations of conventional unsupervised frameworks. This is achieved without altering network architecture or increasing inference cost.
