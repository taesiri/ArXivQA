# [Interpretable Multi-Source Data Fusion Through Latent Variable Gaussian   Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), various engineering domains have started leveraging data-driven models built by fusing data from multiple sources. However, differences in quality, completeness, and unknown underlying parameters during data generation across sources are often not accounted for in modeling. This can lead to inaccurate predictions and lack of interpretability regarding the sources.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an interpretable multi-source data fusion framework based on Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) to address this problem. Key aspects:

1) Represent each data source as a separate categorical variable in LVGP model along with other quantitative system parameters 

2) Learn a low-dimensional latent space that captures similarities and differences across data sources including effects of unknown underlying parameters

3) Define a dissimilarity metric using latent variables to quantify differences between data sources

4) Demonstrate the approach on mathematical test problems and two alloy systems (FeCrAl, SmCoFe) showing improved prediction accuracy and interpretability 

Main Contributions:

- Novel multi-source data fusion technique through LVGP that accounts for disparities across sources
- Latent variable representation enables capturing unknown effects and interpreting relationships between data sources  
- Dissimilarity metric further allows quantifying differences between sources
- Case studies validate improved modeling accuracy, especially for sparse data problems
- Approach provides interpretability regarding data quality and effects of underlying physical parameters
- Can guide targeted data filtering and source selection to improve accuracy

Overall, the paper presents an interpretable ML technique for fusing multi-source engineering data that can lead to better models while accounting for disparities across sources. Key innovation is latent variable modeling of sources.
