# [HOI-Diff: Text-Driven Synthesis of 3D Human-Object Interactions using   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06553)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel modular approach called HOI-Diff for generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) from textual descriptions. The key insight is to decompose the complex task into three components: (1) a dual-branch diffusion model (HOI-DM) to generate coherent but coarse human and object motions conditioned on the text prompt; (2) An affordance prediction diffusion model (APDM) to estimate contacting points between human and object, which is independent of HOI-DM; (3) An affordance-guided interaction correction module that aligns the generated motions using classifier guidance based on the predicted affordances to achieve accurate contact. This modular design reduces the complexity and burden for each component. Experiments on the BEHAVE dataset demonstrate HOI-Diff can generate smooth and realistic HOI motions with accurate human-object contacts for various interactions and object types. Both quantitative metrics and user studies validate the effectiveness of HOI-Diff over strong baselines adapted from prior arts. The annotated textual descriptions on BEHAVE also facilitate future research on this new task.
