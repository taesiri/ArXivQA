# [Long-term Fairness For Real-time Decision Making: A Constrained Online   Optimization Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02552)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of ensuring long-term fairness in dynamic decision-making systems. Specifically, it considers sequential decision problems where decisions need to be made in real-time at each time step, while optimizing some performance objective and satisfying long-term fairness constraints. Most prior works have focused on instantaneous fairness constraints at each timestep, but allowing violations to accumulate over time can lead to unfairness. Hence this paper proposes an approach to ensure fairness over a long time horizon.

Proposed Solution:
The paper formulates the sequential decision problem as an online constrained optimization problem, with the goal of minimizing cumulative loss while satisfying long-term fairness. The fairness constraint requires that bias/unfairness accumulated over time should vanish in the long run. 

To solve this, the paper proposes an online algorithm called LoTFair based on online Lagrangian dual methods. At each timestep, LoTFair makes a decision by taking a modified gradient step to minimize constraint violations, revealed fairness feedback, and then updates dual variables.  

Main Contributions:
- Formulates sequential decision-making under long-term fairness as an online constrained optimization problem
- Proposes the LoTFair online algorithm to solve this problem 
- Proves that under certain assumptions, LoTFair achieves sublinear bounds on both dynamic regret (loss compared to dynamic benchmarks) and dynamic fairness (cumulative unfairness)
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of LoTFair on two application case studies: online fair classification and fair energy management

The key novelty is explicitly enforcing long-term fairness in an online setting, for dynamic systems where fairness constraints may vary arbitrarily over time. Experiments confirm LoTFair can provide fairness guarantees in such systems while maintaining good performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel online algorithm called LoTFair to ensure long-term fairness for real-time decision making in dynamic systems with time-varying fairness constraints, and proves it achieves sub-linear dynamic regret and sub-linear accumulated unfairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework and algorithm to ensure long-term fairness for decision-making systems with time-varying fairness constraints. Specifically:

1) The paper formulates the decision-making problem with long-term fairness constraints as a constrained online optimization problem. 

2) It proposes a novel online algorithm called LoTFair that makes decisions sequentially while ensuring sublinear growth in both dynamic regret (for optimizing performance) and dynamic fairness (for ensuring long-term fairness).

3) LoTFair allows instantaneous fairness violations but bounds the accumulated violations to be sublinear over a long period. This makes the algorithm more flexible and applicable compared to methods focused solely on instantaneous fairness.

4) Theoretical analysis is provided to prove LoTFair achieves sublinear dynamic regret and dynamic fairness under certain assumptions.

5) Experiments on classification and peer-to-peer energy trading showcase the ability of LoTFair to balance performance and long-term fairness in dynamic decision making systems.

In summary, the key innovation is developing an online optimization framework and algorithm to address the challenges of ensuring fairness over an extended timeline in dynamic systems, which has been lacking in prior literature. The theoretical guarantees and experimental validations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LoTFair method.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Long-term fairness - The paper focuses on ensuring fairness over an extended timeline rather than just at individual time steps. This involves allowing for some instantaneous unfairness but ensuring overall fairness in the long run. 

- Dynamic decision-making systems - The paper looks at systems that require real-time decision making over time in dynamic environments. Examples include classification systems and peer-to-peer electricity markets.

- Time-varying fairness constraints - The paper considers fairness constraints that can change over time, rather than being fixed, due to the evolving nature of the systems. 

- Online optimization - Formulating the decision-making problem as an online optimization problem that must be solved in real-time at each time step with limited information.

- Sublinear dynamic regret and fairness - Proving that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear (grows slower than linear) dynamic regret in terms of performance loss and sublinear growth of unfairness over time.

- Constrained optimization - The long-term fairness requirement is encoded as a constraint on the optimization problem.

- Algorithm design - The paper proposes a novel algorithm, LoTFair, to solve the online constrained optimization problem and ensure long-term fairness.

Some other related terms include online learning, classification, peer-to-peer networks, electricity markets, supply and demand balancing, demographic parity constraints, and convex optimization. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
