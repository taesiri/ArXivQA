# [Partial Rewriting for Multi-Stage ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Streaming ASR systems provide low-latency partial results during an utterance, but the quality of these partials is lower than the final result. 
- Recent multi-stage ASR systems use a small left-context only model for streaming partials and a larger context model for high-quality finals. But the partials still have lower quality.
- Prior work that ties multiple models together improves partials but loses right context for finals or requires fixed architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- Run causal (left-context) and cascaded (larger context) models independently and combine their partial outputs via text manipulation.
- Use Levenshtein alignment of partial transcripts to estimate delay between models and blend transcripts.  
- Copy all cascaded tokens first, then append extra causal tokens to create composite.
- Add optimizations like cost thresholds, hysteresis with prior cascaded partials, input cropping for efficiency.

Contributions:
- Significantly improves partial quality (10-19% PWER reduction) without hurting latency or finals.
- Lightweight as it works on model outputs only, doesn't require architecture changes or retraining.
- Can apply this combination algorithm to any multi-decoder streaming ASR system.
- Opens up optimization space for re-allocating model weights between component models.
- Approach is easily expandable to systems with more than 2 component models.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient method to combine partial results from multiple streaming ASR models to improve overall partial quality without negatives. The text-only blending approach is generalized and lightweight, not needing architectural constraints or model retraining.
