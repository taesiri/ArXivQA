# [Partial Rewriting for Multi-Stage ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09463)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Streaming ASR systems provide low-latency partial results during an utterance, but the quality of these partials is lower than the final result. 
- Recent multi-stage ASR systems use a small left-context only model for streaming partials and a larger context model for high-quality finals. But the partials still have lower quality.
- Prior work that ties multiple models together improves partials but loses right context for finals or requires fixed architectures.

Proposed Solution:
- Run causal (left-context) and cascaded (larger context) models independently and combine their partial outputs via text manipulation.
- Use Levenshtein alignment of partial transcripts to estimate delay between models and blend transcripts.  
- Copy all cascaded tokens first, then append extra causal tokens to create composite.
- Add optimizations like cost thresholds, hysteresis with prior cascaded partials, input cropping for efficiency.

Contributions:
- Significantly improves partial quality (10-19% PWER reduction) without hurting latency or finals.
- Lightweight as it works on model outputs only, doesn't require architecture changes or retraining.
- Can apply this combination algorithm to any multi-decoder streaming ASR system.
- Opens up optimization space for re-allocating model weights between component models.
- Approach is easily expandable to systems with more than 2 component models.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient method to combine partial results from multiple streaming ASR models to improve overall partial quality without negatives. The text-only blending approach is generalized and lightweight, not needing architectural constraints or model retraining.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight text manipulation algorithm to improve the quality of streaming automatic speech recognition results from a multi-stage system by merging low-latency interim results with higher quality but delayed final results, without increasing latency or computation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is an algorithm that improves the quality of partial results from a streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) system without increasing latency. Specifically:

- The paper proposes an algorithm that combines the partial results from two ASR models running in parallel - a low-latency causal model and a higher-quality cascaded model. The algorithm uses Levenshtein alignment and text manipulation to create improved composite partial results.

- This approach reduces the partial word error rate by 10-19% on various test sets, while adding negligible latency and computational cost.

- The algorithm works on top of any multi-stage ASR architecture without needing to change the models themselves or requiring them to run synchronously. So it is a general, lightweight method to boost partial result quality.

- The paper also expands the evaluation metrics to better measure quality and flickering of partial results over time.

In summary, the main contribution is a simple but effective streaming algorithm to merge outputs from multiple ASR systems to significantly improve the quality of real-time partial transcriptions. This is done without increasing latency or computational requirements.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a text manipulation algorithm to merge the streaming outputs of a causal model and a cascaded model. What is the intuition behind using text manipulation rather than modifying the model architectures or retraining the models? 

2. Explain in detail the core algorithm for creating the composite transcripts based on Levenshtein alignment of the causal and cascaded model outputs. What modifications were made to the standard Levenshtein algorithm and why?

3. The paper states the algorithm has quadratic run time complexity which can be problematic for longer audio segments. How is this issue addressed? Explain the modifications made to crop the partial results and make the algorithm linear.

4. What is the purpose of trimming the cascaded transcript before alignment? How does this impact the quality and latency of the composite results? 

5. Alignment cost bailing using ρf and ρr is proposed to avoid poor quality composite results when the model outputs differ too much. Explain what these metrics represent and how they are used to determine if rewriting should occur.

6. Walk through algorithms 2 and 3 step-by-step to illustrate how the hysteresis fallback mechanism works when the alignment cost is too high. What is the purpose of this hysteresis?

7. The paper analyzes how changing hyperparameters T, ρr, and K impacts the composite result quality and flickering. For each hyperparameter, explain how increasing its value affects the tradeoff between quality and flickering. 

8. The results show reduced PWER but increased UPWR. Why is some amount of increased flickering expected and how did the approach aim to mitigate it?

9. What modifications could be made to the causal model or training method to take advantage of the rewritten streaming outputs? How could this further improve overall system quality?

10. Beyond the cascaded architecture, what other applications could this method be extended to for merging results from multiple ASR systems? What challenges might arise?
