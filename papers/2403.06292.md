# [Transformer based Multitask Learning for Image Captioning and Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06292)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most image captioning models follow a two-step approach - first extracting image features using a pre-trained object detector, then feeding these features to an encoder-decoder model for caption generation. This has some drawbacks: 1) the object detector is not optimized for the captioning dataset, 2) reliance on pre-computed features causes inference inefficiencies. The paper aims to address these issues.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes TICOD, a multitask learning framework that combines image captioning and object detection in an end-to-end manner. The key ideas are:

1) Use a Swin Transformer backbone as a shared feature extractor for both tasks. This enables joint training and representation learning. 

2) Have parallel decoder networks - one for object detection using Faster/Cascade R-CNN, another for captioning using GPT-2.

3) Joint loss function combining the losses from both tasks to guide training.

The shared backbone and joint loss allow the two tasks to enhance each other's learning. This improves image captioning without compromising object detection accuracy.

Contributions:

1) Proposed a transformer-based end-to-end framework for joint image captioning and object detection

2) Demonstrated performance improvement in image captioning - 3.65% better BERTScore over state-of-the-art while maintaining comparable object detection accuracy

3) Conducted in-depth ablation studies validating the design choices and the benefits of joint training

In summary, the paper presents a multitask learning approach that leverages the complementary information from detection and captioning tasks to learn better representations and improve image captioning performance in an end-to-end manner.
