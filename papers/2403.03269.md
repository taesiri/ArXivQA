# [Active Information Gathering for Long-Horizon Navigation Under   Uncertainty by Learning the Value of Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of long-horizon navigation in partially mapped environments where actively gathering information about unseen parts of the environment is essential for efficient navigation. In large environments that the robot has not fully explored, it is often necessary to proactively seek out information (like a map) to reach goals quickly rather than just reactively exploring. However, quantifying the value of information to guide such active information gathering is very difficult.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper presents a learning-augmented model-based planning approach that can estimate the long-horizon value of information associated with revealing unseen parts of the environment. It builds on the Learning over Subgoals Planning (LSP) framework which represents the robot's high-level actions as boundaries between known free space and unseen space. The key idea is to train a model that computes a "value of information" for revealing each unseen region, representing how much it would improve the robot's navigation plan.

At training time, they efficiently compute this ground-truth value of information for each action by comparing navigation costs with and without access to the information. At test time, a learned model predicts these values and incorporates them into planning to actively seek informative regions when beneficial.

Main Contributions:
- A method to compute long-horizon value of information for revealing unseen space to guide active information gathering 
- Incorporating value of information estimates into model-based planning framework (LSP) to actively seek informative regions when useful
- Demonstrating improved navigation performance in simulated office environments by seeking information like maps only when beneficial

The approach contributes a general framework for information-driven exploration that significantly outperforms baseline navigation strategies. It is reliable, complete, and sound while efficiently estimating and utilizing the long-term value of information.
