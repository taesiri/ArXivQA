# [Active Information Gathering for Long-Horizon Navigation Under   Uncertainty by Learning the Value of Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of long-horizon navigation in partially mapped environments where actively gathering information about unseen parts of the environment is essential for efficient navigation. In large environments that the robot has not fully explored, it is often necessary to proactively seek out information (like a map) to reach goals quickly rather than just reactively exploring. However, quantifying the value of information to guide such active information gathering is very difficult.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper presents a learning-augmented model-based planning approach that can estimate the long-horizon value of information associated with revealing unseen parts of the environment. It builds on the Learning over Subgoals Planning (LSP) framework which represents the robot's high-level actions as boundaries between known free space and unseen space. The key idea is to train a model that computes a "value of information" for revealing each unseen region, representing how much it would improve the robot's navigation plan.

At training time, they efficiently compute this ground-truth value of information for each action by comparing navigation costs with and without access to the information. At test time, a learned model predicts these values and incorporates them into planning to actively seek informative regions when beneficial.

Main Contributions:
- A method to compute long-horizon value of information for revealing unseen space to guide active information gathering 
- Incorporating value of information estimates into model-based planning framework (LSP) to actively seek informative regions when useful
- Demonstrating improved navigation performance in simulated office environments by seeking information like maps only when beneficial

The approach contributes a general framework for information-driven exploration that significantly outperforms baseline navigation strategies. It is reliable, complete, and sound while efficiently estimating and utilizing the long-term value of information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel navigation approach that computes the value of information of revealing unseen spaces at training time to train a model that can actively seek out useful information during deployment when appropriate to improve long-horizon navigation performance in partially mapped environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel general purpose approach for long-horizon point-goal navigation in a partial map that:

1) Allows computing the value of information for an exploratory action (the improvement to the robot's plan if some part of the environment were revealed) at training time.

2) Can estimate and use value of information at planning time to encourage information seeking behavior when appropriate to improve plan performance. 

3) Is complete and sound.

The key ideas are using frontiers (boundaries between free and unseen space) to define exploratory actions, computing their value of information during training, and then using a graph neural network to estimate value of information during deployment to actively seek out useful information. This allows the robot to navigate more efficiently in partially known environments by gathering information that is expected to improve its planning performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Navigation under uncertainty
- Partially observed environments
- Information gathering 
- Value of information
- Long-horizon planning
- Model-based planning
- Learning over subgoals
- Graph neural networks
- Office environments (used as test domains)

The paper presents an approach for robot navigation in partially mapped environments, with a focus on actively gathering information that is expected to improve long-term planning performance. Key ideas include computing the "value of information" for different exploratory actions, training a graph neural network to estimate this value, and using it to encourage information-seeking behavior during planning. The approach is evaluated in simulated office environments.

Some other potential keywords could be: reinforcement learning, belief space planning, POMDPs. But the core focus seems to be on information gathering, planning under uncertainty, and learning to quantify/estimate the value of information.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the paper compute the value of information (VoI) for an exploratory action during training? Explain the key ideas behind computing VoI over a trajectory.

2. The paper mentions using a graph neural network to estimate the VoI during deployment. What are the inputs and outputs to this neural network? What loss function is used to train it?

3. What is the high-level planning algorithm used? How does the estimated VoI term get incorporated into the planning objective function?

4. What are the key advantages of using a model-based planning approach compared to common deep reinforcement learning methods for this navigation task?

6. What process is used to generate training data? What strategies are used to ensure diversity in the data?

7. How does the approach balance local greedy behavior versus global information gathering? Does it always gather information or only when beneficial?
