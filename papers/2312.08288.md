# [Hybrid Sample Synthesis-based Debiasing of Classifier in Limited Data   Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08288)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel debiasing approach to mitigate the effect of unknown biases on deep learning model predictions in the limited data regime. The authors demonstrate that existing debiasing techniques suffer significant performance degradation when trained on small, biased datasets. To address this, they introduce a method to identify likely bias-conflicting samples and synthesize diverse hybrid samples combining these with likely bias-aligned samples. This increases the population and diversity of debiasing samples to reduce overfitting. Experiments on reduced versions of colored MNIST, corrupted CIFAR-10, and BFFHQ datasets show the proposed technique significantly outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art debiasing methods. For instance, with only 10% CIFAR-10 data and 5% bias-conflicting samples, their method achieves 41.23% accuracy, outperforming the next best method by over 9%. The authors also demonstrate their approach does not negatively impact performance when sufficient unbiased data is available. By effectively creating more varied debiasing training examples, the proposed technique is uniquely suited to mitigating unknown biases in the limited data regime.
