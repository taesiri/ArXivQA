# [Deep unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with   Automatic Exposure Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) aims to fuse a low resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) to obtain a high resolution HSI. 
- Existing methods perform poorly when the HSI and MSI have different exposure levels, which is common due to different sensing methods.
- Most methods treat low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and HSI-SR as two separate problems without considering their correlation.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new degradation-recovery model that integrates LLIE and HSI-SR, accounting for different exposure levels.
- Formulate an optimization problem with data-fitting terms and regularizers on exposure maps and HR-HSI. 
- Propose UHSR-AEC deep network to solve it with proximal gradient descent by unfolding regularization steps.
- Design residual blocks to learn implicit regularizers and convolution blocks to learn sampling matrices.
- Propose an Initialization Module (IM) to generate better initial estimates and preserve texture.

Main Contributions:
- First work to jointly model LLIE and HSI-SR for images under different exposures.
- Novel UHSR-AEC network based on deep unfolding to solve the proposed model.
- Initialization module to preserve texture and detail in recovered HSI.
- State-of-the-art results demonstrate effectiveness for fusing images with highly imbalanced exposures.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions by being the first to integrate LLIE and HSI-SR under a joint model and devising a tailored deep unfolding network with impressive performance. The joint modeling and end-to-end learning of the complete pipeline leads to superior HSI fusion capability.
