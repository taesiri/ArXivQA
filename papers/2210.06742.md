# [H2RBox: Horizontal Box Annotation is All You Need for Oriented Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06742)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:Can we achieve weakly supervised learning for oriented object detection by only using horizontal box (HBox) annotations rather than more expensive rotated box (RBox) annotations?The key points are:- Many object detection datasets only have horizontal box annotations, which are not directly compatible for training rotated/oriented object detectors that require rotated box labels. - Obtaining rotated box annotations is more expensive and labor intensive compared to horizontal boxes.- The paper proposes a novel framework called H2RBox to enable weakly supervised learning of an oriented object detector using only horizontal box annotations.- This is achieved through a self-supervised learning approach to predict object rotations by enforcing consistency between differently augmented views of the same image.- Compared to potential alternatives like using instance segmentation, their method is more robust, faster, and uses less memory.- It matches or exceeds the performance of fully supervised methods that use rotated box labels, while only requiring horizontal box annotations.In summary, the main research question is how to train an oriented object detector in a weakly supervised way using just horizontal box annotations, which are more readily available than rotated box labels. Their self-supervised consistency approach provides a solution to this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing H2RBox, the first horizontal box annotation-based oriented object detection method. This allows training an oriented object detector using only horizontal box annotations, avoiding the need for more costly rotated box annotations. 2. The core of H2RBox is a weakly-supervised and self-supervised learning approach that predicts object orientation by enforcing consistency between predictions on two augmented views of the image. This angle learning approach does not rely on potentially inaccurate assumptions or intermediate results like some other weakly supervised methods.3. Experiments show H2RBox significantly outperforms horizontal box supervised instance segmentation methods like BoxInst in accuracy, speed, and memory requirements. It achieves comparable performance to rotated box supervised methods on DOTA and DIOR datasets.4. The proposed consistency loss and training procedure allow reliable angle prediction using only horizontal box supervision. This is a simple yet effective technique that could be incorporated into other detectors.5. Results highlight challenges of horizontal box supervised instance segmentation for oriented object detection, especially in complex dense object scenes. The proposed method avoids shortcomings of the segmentation-based paradigm.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing H2RBox, a novel weakly-supervised framework to train oriented object detectors using only horizontal box annotation, instead of more costly rotated box labels. The self-supervised consistency loss enables learning to predict orientation.
