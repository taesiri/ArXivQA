# [H2RBox: Horizontal Box Annotation is All You Need for Oriented Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06742)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is:Can we achieve weakly supervised learning for oriented object detection by only using horizontal box (HBox) annotations rather than more expensive rotated box (RBox) annotations?The key points are:- Many object detection datasets only have horizontal box annotations, which are not directly compatible for training rotated/oriented object detectors that require rotated box labels. - Obtaining rotated box annotations is more expensive and labor intensive compared to horizontal boxes.- The paper proposes a novel framework called H2RBox to enable weakly supervised learning of an oriented object detector using only horizontal box annotations.- This is achieved through a self-supervised learning approach to predict object rotations by enforcing consistency between differently augmented views of the same image.- Compared to potential alternatives like using instance segmentation, their method is more robust, faster, and uses less memory.- It matches or exceeds the performance of fully supervised methods that use rotated box labels, while only requiring horizontal box annotations.In summary, the main research question is how to train an oriented object detector in a weakly supervised way using just horizontal box annotations, which are more readily available than rotated box labels. Their self-supervised consistency approach provides a solution to this problem.
