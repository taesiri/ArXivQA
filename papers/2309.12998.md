# [Audience-specific Explanations for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently find sentences containing words that need additional explanation when translated to another language, in order to build a dataset for training models to predict words that need explanation during machine translation. 

The key hypothesis is that by utilizing both internal corpus statistics and external knowledge sources like Wikipedia, the authors can develop a robust, efficient methodology to identify sentences containing words needing explanation across multiple language pairs.

In particular, the paper proposes using word counts, word alignment, named entity recognition and Wikipedia to filter down a large parallel corpus to a small subset enriched with sentences containing explanations. The method aims to find as many sentences with explanations as possible while minimizing sentences without explanations.

The authors test their method on English-German, English-French and English-Chinese language pairs. The results show they can reduce the corpus down to a very small fraction, in which a substantial proportion (5-10%) contain explanation sentences - sufficient to construct a training dataset. This consistency across languages indicates the robustness of their approach.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that exploiting both internal and external knowledge can efficiently extract sentences with explanations across languages, which is key for creating data to train models that can predict explanation needs in machine translation. The results support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to efficiently identify sentences containing words that need additional explanations when translating from English to other languages like German, French and Chinese. The key points are:

- They propose a heuristic method utilizing both internal (word counts, word alignment) and external (NER, Wikipedia) knowledge sources to filter down a large parallel corpus and find sentences where the target side contains explanations for certain words or phrases in the source side. 

- This helps alleviate the problem of target audience lacking the proper context/background to understand translated uncommon entities, which pure machine translation fails to handle.

- Their method is shown to be robust across the English-German, English-French and English-Chinese language pairs tested. The final remaining sentences contain a substantial proportion (7-13%) of sentences with explanations, greatly reducing manual effort needed.

- This enables building a quality training dataset, which can then be used to train models that can automatically predict which words need explanation during translation.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing an effective technique to extract explanatory sentence pairs from a parallel corpus, which facilitates building datasets to train models that can provide audience-specific explanations to improve machine translation. The method's robustness across multiple language pairs is also demonstrated.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- The goal of this paper is to develop a methodology for identifying words/phrases that need additional explanation when translating from English to other languages like German, French, and Chinese. This goal is quite novel compared to most existing machine translation research which focuses on improving translation quality itself. 

- Most prior work on translating rare/uncommon words relies on using external dictionaries or breaking words into subword units. While helpful, these methods don't address the core issue of audience comprehension. This paper tackles the problem from that angle.

- The idea of using parallel corpora to extract explanations is not entirely new, but actually building the datasets has proven difficult due to how sparse these sentences are. The semi-automatic pipeline proposed here using statistics, NER, and Wikipedia is an innovative approach to overcome that sparsity.

- Considering target audience needs during translation is inspired by human translators but hasn't been explored much computationally. The authors frame the problem clearly as predicting which words need explanation. This differs from past translation studies.

- Experiments across 3 language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique. The method generalizes well, consistently yielding 100x density of sentences with explanations. This is a significant advancement over prior manual efforts.

- The extracted data can be used to train and evaluate models for selecting words to explain. This practical application for improving audience comprehension is a unique contribution.

In summary, this paper pushes machine translation in a novel direction by addressing audience needs and provides an innovative computational solution to enable future progress. The comparative results are promising and highlight the potential of this research area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few future research directions:

1. Train and evaluate models to predict words that need explanation using the dataset built with their proposed methodology. They developed a semi-automatic technique to extract sentences containing explanations from a parallel corpus. This dataset can now be used to train and test models for predicting words that need explanation. 

2. Explore different forms of explanations beyond just inserting text after the word being explained. The current work focused on explanations that immediately follow the word being explained. But other forms like footnotes could also be explored. 

3. Evaluate the impact of these audience-specific explanations on the comprehension of machine translation output. The authors extracted sentences with explanations but did not evaluate if adding these explanations actually improves understanding by the target audience. Evaluating the impact on comprehension is an important next step.

4. Explore methods to generate the explanations automatically rather than extracting them from parallel data. The current work relies on existing explanations in parallel data. Future work could look at generating explanations automatically based on the word and context.

5. Extend the techniques to identify and generate explanations for other language pairs beyond English-German/French/Chinese. Testing on more language pairs would demonstrate broader applicability.

In summary, the main future directions are: 1) training and evaluating models for predicting explanation needs, 2) exploring different explanation forms, 3) evaluating impact on comprehension, 4) generating explanations automatically, and 5) extending to more language pairs. The key next step is leveraging the extracted data to train and test models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method to automatically identify sentences containing words that need additional explanation for machine translation, in order to create training data to develop models that can predict which words require explanation. The key challenge is that sentences with explanations are very sparse. The proposed method utilizes both internal (word counts, word alignment) and external (named entity recognition, Wikipedia) knowledge sources to efficiently filter a parallel corpus and identify candidate sentences. Experiments on English-German, English-French, and English-Chinese show the method can reduce the corpus to a very small size where over 5-10% of remaining sentences contain explanations, enabling construction of a dataset. The method is shown to be robust across different language pairs and input data. Overall, this is an essential first step towards automatically determining which words need explanation for machine translation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to identify sentences that contain words needing explanation for machine translation. The authors aim to build a dataset to train models that can predict which words need explanation when translating text. However, sentences with explanations are very uncommon, making it hard to build a dataset. 

The proposed method uses word counts, word alignment, named entity recognition and Wikipedia to efficiently find sentences with explanations. Experiments on English-German, English-French, and English-Chinese show the method reduces the sentences needing manual checking to a very small number. For all language pairs, over 5-10% of the remaining sentences contain explanations after applying the method's filters. This allows building a sufficient dataset while minimizing manual work. The consistent results across languages indicate the method is robust. Overall, this is an important first step in automatically creating a dataset to train explanation prediction models for machine translation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a heuristic method to efficiently find parallel sentence pairs containing explanations for uncommon words or phrases, in order to build a dataset for training models to predict which words need explanation during machine translation. The method utilizes both internal (word count, word alignment) and external (named entity recognition, Wikipedia) knowledge sources to filter down candidate sentences in four main steps. First, corpus statistics are used to identify potentially uncommon words. Second, word alignments are analyzed to find target-side sentences with redundant text following the translation of the uncommon word. Third, named entity recognition models are applied to further filter candidates. Finally, Wikipedia is used to check whether source named entities have corresponding articles in the target language. Experiments on English-German, English-French, and English-Chinese show the method can consistently extract target sentences, despite different data distributions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to eliminate target language audience's incomprehension during machine translation of words that are common in the source language but not common in the target language. 

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

1) How to identify words or phrases in the source text that will cause incomprehension when translated literally to the target language. 

2) How to build a dataset to train models to accurately predict which words need additional explanation during machine translation.

The main challenge is that sentences containing words needing explanation are extremely uncommon, making it difficult to build a sufficiently large training dataset.
