# [Streaming Sequence Transduction through Dynamic Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01172)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Streaming Sequence Transduction through Dynamic Compression":

Problem:
Traditional sequence transduction models like speech recognition and translation systems assume fully observing the input sequence before generating outputs. This causes high latency and makes them impractical for real-time applications requiring low latency like simultaneous translation. Prior works on streaming sequence transduction focus on predicting triggers to decide when to start decoding outputs but do not address efficiently compressing historical information to optimize memory usage.

Method: 
The paper proposes STAR (Stream Transduction with Anchor Representations) to address both latency and memory efficiency for streaming sequence transduction. STAR introduces a segmenter scored by encoder-decoder cross-attention to partition the input stream. When a trigger is detected, the current segment is compressed into an "anchor representation" that aggregates information into a single vector. During decoding, previously generated anchor representations are accessed to generate outputs.  

Contributions:
1) Proposes a streaming architecture that dynamically segments and compresses streams to optimize latency, memory footprint and quality.
2) Introduces concept of anchor representations that aggregate historical information into compact vectors located at trigger positions.
3) Demonstrates STAR achieves 12x compression with almost no performance loss on speech recognition.
4) Shows superior quality-latency tradeoffs compared to prior streaming and compression methods on simultaneous speech recognition and translation.

In summary, the paper presents a novel streaming architecture STAR that leverages dynamic segmentation and compression to optimize multiple objectives crucial for real-time sequence transduction applications. Both the compression method through anchor representations and the segmenter scoring are key technical innovations demonstrated to outperform existing approaches.
