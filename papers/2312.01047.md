# [A New Random Reshuffling Method for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Finite-sum   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01047)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers large-scale nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems of the form:

\min f(w) + φ(w)

where f is a finite sum of differentiable functions and φ is a nonsmooth weakly convex regularizer. Such problems arise frequently in machine learning applications. Existing stochastic algorithms like proximal stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) have limitations in this setting. The goal is to develop an efficient algorithm with fast convergence for this problem class.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new proximal random reshuffling (PRR) method called Normal Map based PRR (NPRR). The key ideas are:

- Use a stochastic gradient estimate based on sampling component functions without replacement to approximate the full gradient more accurately. This is similar to random reshuffling methods for smooth problems.

- Incorporate the normal map operator in the update steps. The normal map helps maintain feasibility and convergence guarantees.

- Perform only one proximal step per iteration instead of after each stochastic gradient step. This allows approximating the full gradient.

Main Contributions:

- Develop the NPRR algorithm and provide a comprehensive convergence analysis, including:

    - Nonasymptotic complexity bound that matches existing RR methods 

    - First limit point convergence result for PRR methods

    - Last iterate convergence guarantee under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequality

    - Convergence rates that match smooth RR methods when the KL exponent θ ∈ [0, 1/2]

- Establish key properties like sufficient descent in each step despite the nonsmooth composite setting

- Present preliminary experiments on ML problems demonstrating efficiency of the proposed method

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in designing and analyzing PRR methods for nonsmooth nonconvex problems with theoretical and empirical evidence of faster convergence. The analysis provides new insights into PRR methods.
