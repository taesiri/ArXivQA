# [A resource-constrained stochastic scheduling algorithm for homeless   street outreach and gleaning edible food](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Breaking Ground and Leket are two social organizations facing resource constrained stochastic scheduling problems in their operations. 
- Breaking Ground aims to transition homeless individuals to permanent housing through street outreach, but has limited outreach workers. The problem is deciding which clients to visit each day to maximize transitions to better housing states.
- Leket rescues excess produce from farms to feed the poor. With limited staff, the problem is deciding which farms to contact each day to maximize food rescued.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper develops a reusable restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) algorithm that can effectively solve the scheduling problems of both organizations.
- The algorithm handles partially observed states, unlabeled state transitions, flexibility beyond Whittle index policies, and is computationally tractable.
- It uses Thompson sampling with Markov chain recovery via Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to estimate transition probabilities.

Main Contributions:
- First prospective study showing a single algorithm can work with minimal adjustment for multiple social good organizations. Addresses lack of sustainable impact in data science for social good.
- New RMAB algorithm that handles partial observability, unlabeled transitions, computational efficiency for larger state spaces, and flexibility beyond Whittle index policies.  
- Integrates valid finite-particle SVGD in model-based RL for the first time. Allows fast and accurate approximation of posterior transition probabilities.
- Experiments show the algorithm significantly outperforms baselines on real-world data from both Leket and Breaking Ground.

In summary, the paper makes both technical and broader impact contributions by developing a practical RMAB algorithm that can effectively solve scheduling problems for multiple social good organizations. This helps address the issue of lack of sustainable impact in data science for social good.
