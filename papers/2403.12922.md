# [Contextual AD Narration with Interleaved Multimodal Sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12922)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating high-quality audio descriptions (ADs) for videos is important for making media content accessible, but manually creating ADs is expensive and not scalable.  
- Existing automatic AD generation methods have limitations like poor scalability, complex prompt engineering, weak multimodal alignment, and lack of contextual reasoning.

Proposed Solution - Uni-AD:
- Proposes a simple and unified framework to generate contextual AD narration using interleaved multimodal sequence as input to large language models (LLMs).

Key Details:
- Formulates video, text, images, context as interleaved sequence to enable fine-grained multimodal alignment in LLMs.
- Introduces character-refinement module to identify key characters related to AD narration.  
- Incorporates past visual content and ADs as context, along with contrastive loss to generate coherent and non-repetitive ADs.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on MAD-eval benchmark by extending the approach to LLaMA-7B via the lightweight mapping network.

Main Contributions:
- Novel way of formulating multimodal inputs as interleaved sequences for fine-grained feature alignment.
- Character-refinement module for filtering character information.
- Contextual modeling using past visual content and ADs with contrastive loss.
- State-of-the-art performance on AD narration by scaling to larger LLMs.
- Comprehensive analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

The key idea is to represent the multimodal inputs as sequences for the LLM instead of global features, to enable better interaction and alignment between modalities. The contextual narration generation is enhanced using additional techniques like character refinement and contrastive learning.
