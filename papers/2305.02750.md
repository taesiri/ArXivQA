# A Survey on Proactive Dialogue Systems: Problems, Methods, and Prospects

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is: How to design proactive dialogue systems that can lead conversations towards pre-defined goals or targets from the system side, instead of only passively responding to users?The paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in building proactive capabilities into conversational agents across three major types of dialogues - open-domain dialogues, task-oriented dialogues, and information-seeking dialogues. The key hypothesis is that equipping conversational agents with proactivity will enable more natural, efficient and goal-oriented dialogues, as well as empower agents to handle more complex tasks requiring strategic interactions. The authors systematically summarize problems, methods, datasets and evaluations for enabling proactivity in conversational agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive survey on proactive dialogue systems. Specifically, it:- Summarizes recent advances in developing conversational agent's proactivity for three common types of dialogues: open-domain, task-oriented, and information-seeking. - Discusses prominent problems and advanced designs in proactive dialogue systems, including target-guided dialogues, prosocial dialogues, non-collaborative dialogues, enriched task-oriented dialogues, asking clarification questions, and user preference elicitation.- Presents representative datasets and commonly-used evaluation protocols for different problems in proactive dialogue systems. - Provides a thorough discussion on open challenges and promising research directions, such as proactivity in hybrid dialogues, evaluation protocols for proactivity, and ethics of conversational agent's proactivity.Overall, this is the first comprehensive survey focused on reviewing the state-of-the-art and discussing the prospects on an important direction of dialogue systems research - developing conversational agent's proactivity. It offers useful insights into the landscape of proactive dialogue systems and can serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in this field.
