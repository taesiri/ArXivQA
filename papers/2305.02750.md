## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Proactivity in Hybrid Dialogue Systems: The authors argue that most current dialogue systems focus on a single conversational goal, whereas real-world applications often involve multiple, changing goals within the same conversation. They suggest more research is needed on proactive dialogue systems that can handle hybrid conversations with smooth transitions across different types of dialogues and goals.  

2. Evaluation Protocols for Proactivity: The authors note the lack of robust evaluation protocols tailored for proactive dialogue systems, which require assessing both natural language capabilities and psychological/sociological factors. They call for developing more effective multi-disciplinary evaluation methods.

3. Ethics of Conversational Agent Proactivity: The authors highlight ethical concerns around factual correctness, morality, and privacy that are amplified in proactive systems. They suggest research is needed to ensure proactive systems are controllable, non-aggressive, and privacy-preserving.

In summary, the main future directions focus on advancing proactive dialogue capabilities for hybrid conversations, developing suitable evaluation methods, and addressing ethical issues to ensure safe and beneficial proactive systems. The authors aim to stimulate further research to progress conversational AI to more human-like capabilities.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances in proactive dialogue systems. Proactive dialogue systems aim to enable conversational agents to lead conversations and take initiative, rather than just passively respond to users. The paper summarizes research on three main types of proactive dialogue systems: open-domain, task-oriented, and conversational information-seeking systems. 

For open-domain systems, the paper discusses target-guided dialogues, where agents aim to steer conversations towards particular topics, and prosocial dialogues, where agents mitigate problematic user statements. For task-oriented systems, the paper covers non-collaborative dialogues like persuasion and negotiation, and enriched dialogues with additional information. For conversational information-seeking, the paper reviews systems that ask clarification questions and elicit user preferences. The paper summarizes key datasets and evaluation methods and discusses open challenges like handling hybrid goals, evaluation protocols, and ethics. Overall, the survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent research problems, models, datasets, and challenges in developing more proactive dialogue agents.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end framework called UniPCQA for conversational question answering. UniPCQA leverages a unified sequence-to-sequence formulation to jointly tackle three subtasks: clarification need prediction, clarification question generation, and conversational question answering. Specifically, the model takes as input the dialogue context, the user query, and the candidate answers. It first predicts whether the query needs clarification based on the encoder representation. If clarification is needed, it generates a clarification question by attending over the dialogue context. After appending the clarification question and answer to the context, the model performs answer selection from the candidate answers. In this way, UniPCQA can simultaneously handle clarification and answering in a single model. The model is trained end-to-end using cross-entropy loss for clarification need prediction and clarification question generation, and using margin-based loss for answer selection. Experiments show UniPCQA outperforms pipeline approaches and achieves new state-of-the-art results on conversational question answering benchmarks.
