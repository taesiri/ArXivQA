# A Survey on Proactive Dialogue Systems: Problems, Methods, and Prospects

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question of this paper is: How to design proactive dialogue systems that can lead conversations towards pre-defined goals or targets from the system side, instead of only passively responding to users?The paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in building proactive capabilities into conversational agents across three major types of dialogues - open-domain dialogues, task-oriented dialogues, and information-seeking dialogues. The key hypothesis is that equipping conversational agents with proactivity will enable more natural, efficient and goal-oriented dialogues, as well as empower agents to handle more complex tasks requiring strategic interactions. The authors systematically summarize problems, methods, datasets and evaluations for enabling proactivity in conversational agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is providing a comprehensive survey on proactive dialogue systems. Specifically, it:- Summarizes recent advances in developing conversational agent's proactivity for three common types of dialogues: open-domain, task-oriented, and information-seeking. - Discusses prominent problems and advanced designs in proactive dialogue systems, including target-guided dialogues, prosocial dialogues, non-collaborative dialogues, enriched task-oriented dialogues, asking clarification questions, and user preference elicitation.- Presents representative datasets and commonly-used evaluation protocols for different problems in proactive dialogue systems. - Provides a thorough discussion on open challenges and promising research directions, such as proactivity in hybrid dialogues, evaluation protocols for proactivity, and ethics of conversational agent's proactivity.Overall, this is the first comprehensive survey focused on reviewing the state-of-the-art and discussing the prospects on an important direction of dialogue systems research - developing conversational agent's proactivity. It offers useful insights into the landscape of proactive dialogue systems and can serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in this field.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on proactive dialogue systems across various types of dialogues, including problem definitions, advanced methods, available datasets, evaluation protocols, and open challenges.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this survey paper on proactive dialogue systems compares to other related work:- Scope: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent research on enabling conversational agent's proactivity across three major dialogue tasks - open-domain, task-oriented, and information-seeking dialogues. It covers a broad range of problems and techniques, more extensive than previous surveys that focus on a single dialogue type.- Structure: The paper systematically organizes recent studies into prominent problems for proactive agents in each dialogue type. This structured categorization of methods and clear problem definitions facilitate understanding. - Data resources: The paper summarizes key publicly available datasets that support research for different proactive dialogue problems. This is useful for those looking for benchmarks.- Latest advances: As a survey published in 2023, this paper covers very recent studies on proactive dialogue systems from top venues in 2021-2022, providing timely insights into latest techniques.- Challenges & future directions: The paper provides an insightful discussion of open challenges and promising research directions, catalysing innovation in this field.- First of its kind: To my knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey focusing specifically on proactive dialogue agents, which have become an important research area.Overall, this survey offers an extensive and structured overview of the emerging field of proactive conversational AI. By synthesizing scattered studies into a unified frame, discussing open problems, and summarizing resources, it provides helpful insights for researchers and facilitates future advances in human-like proactive dialogue agents.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:1. Proactivity in Hybrid Dialogue Systems: The authors argue that most current dialogue systems focus on a single conversational goal, whereas real-world applications often involve multiple, changing goals within the same conversation. They suggest more research is needed on proactive dialogue systems that can handle hybrid conversations with smooth transitions across different types of dialogues and goals.  2. Evaluation Protocols for Proactivity: The authors note the lack of robust evaluation protocols tailored for proactive dialogue systems, which require assessing both natural language capabilities and psychological/sociological factors. They call for developing more effective multi-disciplinary evaluation methods.3. Ethics of Conversational Agent Proactivity: The authors highlight ethical concerns around factual correctness, morality, and privacy that are amplified in proactive systems. They suggest research is needed to ensure proactive systems are controllable, non-aggressive, and privacy-preserving.In summary, the main future directions focus on advancing proactive dialogue capabilities for hybrid conversations, developing suitable evaluation methods, and addressing ethical issues to ensure safe and beneficial proactive systems. The authors aim to stimulate further research to progress conversational AI to more human-like capabilities.
