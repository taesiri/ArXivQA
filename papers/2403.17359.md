# [Chain-of-Action: Faithful and Multimodal Question Answering through   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with two major challenges when applied to question answering: unfaithful hallucination (generating responses inconsistent with facts) and weak reasoning over compositional information from multiple sources.  

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new framework called Chain-of-Action (CoA) to enhance faithfulness and multi-step reasoning for question answering. 

- CoA integrates a reasoning-retrieval mechanism that decomposes complex questions into reasoning chains of configurable actions via systematic prompting. The actions address retrievals for real-time information, domain knowledge, and tabular data to ground the model's responses.

- Three types of generic, modular "Plug-and-Play" actions are proposed: web-querying, knowledge-encoding, and data-analyzing. These can flexibly incorporate additional multimodal sources.

- A novel multi-reference faith score (MRFS) is used to identify and resolve conflicts between retrieved information and LLM-generated responses to enhance reliability.

Main Contributions:
- Presents CoA, a new universal framework for equipping LLMs to initiate information-seeking actions and construct reasoning chains to answer complex questions.

- Proposes three customizable, domain-adaptable actions for retrieving real-time and domain information from heterogeneous sources. Extensible to new modalities. 

- Introduces MRFS for effectively verifying and resolving conflicts between LLM responses and external information.

- Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple QA datasets. Also validates effectiveness via improved user engagement in a real-world Web3 QA application.

In summary, the CoA framework significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning, faithfulness and efficiency in answering complex, externally-grounded questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The Chain-of-Action (CoA) framework, which integrates a novel reasoning-retrieval mechanism to decompose complex questions into reasoning chains of configurable actions via systematic prompting. The framework can retrieve heterogeneous multimodal information and reduce information conflicts.

2. Three types of "Plug-and-Play" domain-adaptable actions (web-querying, knowledge-encoding, data-analyzing) to address retrievals for real-time information, domain knowledge, and tabular data. The actions are flexible to incorporate additional sources.

3. A new metric, the multi-reference faith score (MRFS), to identify and resolve conflicts between retrieved information and LLM-generated answers, enhancing answer reliability. 

4. Experimental results demonstrating that the CoA framework surpasses existing methods on multiple QA datasets.

5. A real-world application in a Web3 QA product showing significant increases in user engagement and positive feedback, validating the framework's effectiveness and practicality.

In summary, the main contribution is the Chain-of-Action framework and its components, which enable more faithful and multi-step reasoning for question answering while integrating retrieval of multimodal external information. The experiments and case study demonstrate its superior performance over other methods.
