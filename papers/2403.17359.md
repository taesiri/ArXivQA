# [Chain-of-Action: Faithful and Multimodal Question Answering through   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with two major challenges when applied to question answering: unfaithful hallucination (generating responses inconsistent with facts) and weak reasoning over compositional information from multiple sources.  

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new framework called Chain-of-Action (CoA) to enhance faithfulness and multi-step reasoning for question answering. 

- CoA integrates a reasoning-retrieval mechanism that decomposes complex questions into reasoning chains of configurable actions via systematic prompting. The actions address retrievals for real-time information, domain knowledge, and tabular data to ground the model's responses.

- Three types of generic, modular "Plug-and-Play" actions are proposed: web-querying, knowledge-encoding, and data-analyzing. These can flexibly incorporate additional multimodal sources.

- A novel multi-reference faith score (MRFS) is used to identify and resolve conflicts between retrieved information and LLM-generated responses to enhance reliability.

Main Contributions:
- Presents CoA, a new universal framework for equipping LLMs to initiate information-seeking actions and construct reasoning chains to answer complex questions.

- Proposes three customizable, domain-adaptable actions for retrieving real-time and domain information from heterogeneous sources. Extensible to new modalities. 

- Introduces MRFS for effectively verifying and resolving conflicts between LLM responses and external information.

- Demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on multiple QA datasets. Also validates effectiveness via improved user engagement in a real-world Web3 QA application.

In summary, the CoA framework significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning, faithfulness and efficiency in answering complex, externally-grounded questions.
