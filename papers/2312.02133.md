# [Style Aligned Image Generation via Shared Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02133)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces StyleAligned, a novel technique for establishing consistent style interpretation across a series of generated images from text-to-image (T2I) models. By employing minimal "attention sharing" operations during the diffusion process, StyleAligned maintains style consistency between images without requiring fine-tuning or manual intervention. Specifically, attention is shared from a reference image to other generated images, using an adaptive instance normalization technique to enable balanced attention flow. This allows creating diverse image sets that share style attributes like color, drawing technique, composition, etc. StyleAligned can also transfer style from a given input image through diffusion inversion, enabling style-consistent image generation from any style reference. The method is evaluated over diverse styles and text prompts, demonstrating high quality and fidelity to prompts and reference styles. Unlike other personalization techniques requiring optimization, StyleAligned provides zero-shot style alignment, making it easily integrable into existing T2I pipelines. Key benefits highlighted are consistent style interpretation, high visual quality, and straightforward applicability without training.
