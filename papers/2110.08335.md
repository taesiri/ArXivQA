# [Trigger Hunting with a Topological Prior for Trojan Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08335)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor (Trojan) attacks where attackers inject poisoned samples into the training data. These poisoned samples contain triggers (e.g. specific patterns) that cause the model to consistently misclassify when the trigger is present. Detecting these Trojan models is challenging especially when there is limited access to the training data. Existing reverse engineering based approaches aims to recover possible triggers from the model using a few clean images, however, they struggle with the enormous search space and unknown target labels.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel reverse engineering framework with two key components to improve Trojan detection:

1. A topological prior, enforced through a topological loss, that encourages the recovered trigger pattern to have fewer connected components and thus be more compact and localized. This significantly reduces the search space and improves trigger quality.

2. A diversity loss that generates multiple diverse candidate triggers. By producing multiple candidates, it increases the chance of recovering the true trigger, especially when the target label is unknown.

The improved triggers are then used to extract descriptive features which are fed into a Trojan detection network to classify models as clean or Trojaned.

Main Contributions:
- A topological loss based on persistent homology theory to enforce compactness of recovered triggers 
- A diversity loss to produce multiple diverse candidate triggers to mitigate unknown target labels
- Significantly higher Trojan detection performance on both synthetic and benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods

The proposed topological and diversity priors allow high quality trigger recovery which directly translates to enhanced Trojan detection capabilities. The method is also target label agnostic and works on black-box models.
