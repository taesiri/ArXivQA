# [UR2M: Uncertainty and Resource-Aware Event Detection on Microcontrollers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Designing machine learning models for wearable event detection (WED) on resource-constrained microcontrollers (MCUs) faces three key challenges: (1) Existing WED models prioritize classification accuracy over prediction reliability (uncertainty). However, uncertainty is crucial for applications like healthcare to avoid over-confidence. (2) Quantifying uncertainty is computationally expensive, requiring multiple models and inferences, straining limited MCU resources. (3) Supporting multi-event detection requires even more models, exacerbating memory constraints. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes UR2M, an uncertainty and resource-aware WED framework for MCUs. The key ideas are:

(1) Employ evidential deep learning (EDL) to efficiently predict both classification and uncertainty via a single model and inference pass. 

(2) Design a cascade model with early exits to share layers within (intra-event) and across (inter-event) multiple events. Uncertainty thresholds trigger early exits to minimize latency and energy.  

(3) Optimize model architecture, quantization, library components for system efficiency.

Key Contributions:

(1) Novel uncertainty-aware learning using EDL tailored for resource-efficient WED on MCUs

(2) Cascade model architecture enabling efficient multi-event detection via intra- and inter-event layer sharing  

(3) Comprehensive system optimization, including architecture search, model compression, library optimizations for deployability

(4) Extensive evaluation on 3 datasets and 2 MCUs shows UR2M reduces latency by 864% and energy by 857% over uncertainty baselines with similar uncertainty performance. It also saves 55% memory over baselines.

In summary, the paper makes WED on MCUs more deployable by not only optimizing for efficiency but also elevating model reliability through principled uncertainty estimation.
