# [The X-LANCE Technical Report for Interspeech 2024 Speech Processing   Using Discrete Speech Unit Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06079)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper aims to describe the systems developed by the SJTU X-LANCE group for the text-to-speech (TTS), singing voice synthesis (SVS), and automatic speech recognition (ASR) tracks in the Interspeech 2024 Speech Processing Using Discrete Speech Unit Challenge. The goal is to build high-quality systems with low bitrates.

Proposed Solutions:

TTS Track: 
- Uses FunCodec as the discrete tokens and a modified VQTTS system as the TTS pipeline. FunCodec has a lower bitrate of 250bps while achieving competitive naturalness.
- The TTS acoustic model predicts discrete units in an autoregressive manner. The vocoder takes discrete units and other features as input and reconstructs the waveform.
- Additional techniques like providing frame-level phonemes and structured dropout are used to improve quality.

SVS Track:
- Uses the first layer codes of Descript Audio Codec (DAC) as discrete tokens and a modified VALL-E system for the SVS pipeline. 
- Employs a non-autoregressive transformer to predict discrete units. The vocoder further predicts more DAC layers and decodes the waveform.

ASR Track: 
- Extracts acoustic tokens using k-means clustering on WavLM embeddings. Data augmentation is used to improve robustness.
- Uses a Conformer-Transducer model with Zipformer as the encoder for end-to-end ASR.

Main Contributions:
- Achieved the 1st rank on the TTS track leaderboard with the highest naturalness score and lowest bitrate. The TTS model even works decently with just 1 hour of training data.
- Carefully designed model architectures and training strategies for both the acoustic model and vocoder in TTS and SVS to ensure high-quality and stable generation. 
- Provided comprehensive experiments and analyses to compare different discrete token choices and model designs. The findings provide useful insights and guidance on discrete speech processing.
