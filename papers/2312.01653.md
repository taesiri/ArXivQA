# [An End-to-End Network Pruning Pipeline with Sparsity Enforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01653)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an end-to-end neural network pruning pipeline that incorporates sparsity considerations into all stages of training. It utilizes nonstandard model initialization (ZerO), learns a sparsity mask during pre-pruning training, applies magnitude-based pruning, and optimizes post-pruning training (with label smoothing, soft activations, soft skip connections). Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 classify sparse MLPs and VGG networks, comparing against training-free pruning and state-of-the-art sparse training baselines. Key results show retained performance at extreme sparsities (<1% parameters), dominated by the learned masking technique. While most prior works focus on moderate sparsities (~10%), this pipeline pushes an order of magnitude lower. Discussion examines the complementary effects of initialization and masking, the scalability to larger models, and potential gains from applying these techniques to attention layers. Overall, the end-to-end methodology provides a strong framework for effectively training highly sparse networks.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks are growing larger, making deployment on resource-constrained devices challenging. Neural network pruning is a technique to address this by reducing model size and complexity while maintaining accuracy.
- Most pruning pipelines only modify the standard training pipeline at one stage or not at all. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an end-to-end neural network pruning pipeline that incorporates optimizations for sparsification at all stages - initialization, pre-pruning training, pruning, and post-pruning training.

Methods:
- Use Zero initialization that starts with low rank transformations to improve pruning.  
- Learn a sparsity mask jointly during pre-pruning training to guide the final pruning. Add regularization to enforce sparsity in the mask.
- Use magnitude-based pruning after pre-training to create a sparse model based on the mask.
- Introduce label smoothing, soft activations, and soft skip connections in post-pruning training to initially smooth optimization and then recover normal training.

Experiments:
- Test pipeline on MLP and VGG-16 architectures for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
- Achieve higher accuracy compared to baselines down to extreme sparsity levels of 0.1-0.3% on CIFAR-10.
- The learned mask contributes significantly whereas other optimization provide smaller gains.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an end-to-end pruning pipeline incorporating custom initialization, training methodologies, and optimizations specifically for neural network sparsification.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance for neural network sparsification, especially in very sparse regimes. 
- Identifies learned masks during training as an important technique for improving final pruned accuracy.

The paper presents an end-to-end perspective on effectively training sparse neural networks, leading to performance that exceeds prior art at extreme sparsity levels. The key innovation is customizing techniquesapplied at each stage to specifically promote sparsity.
