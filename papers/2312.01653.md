# [An End-to-End Network Pruning Pipeline with Sparsity Enforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01653)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an end-to-end neural network pruning pipeline that incorporates sparsity considerations into all stages of training. It utilizes nonstandard model initialization (ZerO), learns a sparsity mask during pre-pruning training, applies magnitude-based pruning, and optimizes post-pruning training (with label smoothing, soft activations, soft skip connections). Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 classify sparse MLPs and VGG networks, comparing against training-free pruning and state-of-the-art sparse training baselines. Key results show retained performance at extreme sparsities (<1% parameters), dominated by the learned masking technique. While most prior works focus on moderate sparsities (~10%), this pipeline pushes an order of magnitude lower. Discussion examines the complementary effects of initialization and masking, the scalability to larger models, and potential gains from applying these techniques to attention layers. Overall, the end-to-end methodology provides a strong framework for effectively training highly sparse networks.
