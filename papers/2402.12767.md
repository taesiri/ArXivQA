# [When and How: Learning Identifiable Latent States for Nonstationary Time   Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time series forecasting is an important task but most existing methods assume the time series data is stationary. 
- However, real-world time series data often exhibits nonstationarity, meaning the distribution changes over time. Directly applying existing methods leads to poor performance.  
- Previous works on nonstationary time series forecasting make restrictive assumptions about when and how the distribution changes.

Proposed Method:
- The paper proposes a new method called IDEA that can identify when and how the distribution changes in a nonstationary time series.

- IDEA disentangles the latent state into stationary and nonstationary components. The nonstationary components capture distribution shifts corresponding to different latent "environments".

- A Markov assumption is made - the sequence of latent environments follows a Markov chain. This allows detecting when distribution shifts occur.

- The stationary components follow autoregressive dynamics. By learning separate transition models for the stationary and nonstationary states, IDEA identifies how each component evolves over time.

- Sufficient observation and identifiability assumptions are made to guarantee the latent states can be recovered.

Contributions:
- IDEA provides theoretical guarantees for identifying latent states and environments for nonstationary time series forecasting.

- Experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate IDEA's ability to accurately detect distribution shifts. 

- IDEA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for forecasting, showing the benefits of modeling when and how distributions change over time.

- The assumptions made are reasonable for many real nonstationary time series while still allowing theoretical analysis.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions towards principled and interpretable nonstationary time series forecasting by proposing a method to identify when and how distribution shifts occur over time. The combination of strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees sets IDEA apart from prior arts.
