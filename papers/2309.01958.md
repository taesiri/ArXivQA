# [Empowering Low-Light Image Enhancer through Customized Learnable Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01958)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: "Can we customize learnable priors for illumination and noise terms that leverage their intrinsic properties to improve the transparency and interpretability of deep unfolding for low-light image enhancement?"The key points are:- Existing deep unfolding methods for low-light image enhancement use proximal operator networks to impose priors on the illumination and noise terms. However, these are designed in an ambiguous black-box manner. - The authors propose to explore using customized learnable priors based on the intrinsic properties of illumination (should be smooth and preserve structure) and noise (irrelevant to enhanced lightness).- They utilize Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to pre-train models to capture these intrinsic priors. The illumination prior is trained to reconstruct an illumination map filtered with a bilateral filter. The noise prior is trained to reconstruct HOG features that represent gradients.- These learned priors are integrated in two ways: 1) The illumination prior is embedded into the proximal operator for decomposition. 2) The noise prior is used as a regularization term to enforce gradient consistency.- Experiments show their method outperforms prior deep unfolding and other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the benefits of customized learnable priors.In summary, the key hypothesis is that using customized learnable priors based on intrinsic properties can improve deep unfolding for low-light enhancement in terms of performance and interpretability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new deep unfolding paradigm for low-light image enhancement that explores the potential of customized learnable priors to improve the transparency and interpretability. Specifically:- It proposes to use Masked Autoencoders (MAE) to learn customized illumination and noise priors for low-light images in a pre-training stage. - The learned illumination prior is embedded into the proximal operator design in the unfolding architecture to improve its transparency.- The learned noise prior is redeveloped as a regularization term in the loss function to constrain gradient consistency and suppress noise.- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. The customized priors also demonstrate effectiveness.In summary, the key novelty is utilizing pre-trained MAE-based customized priors, from both the model architecture design and optimization perspectives, to enhance the transparency and performance of deep unfolding for low-light image enhancement. This explores the potential of learnable priors in improving deep unfolding solutions.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of low-light image enhancement:- This paper proposes a new deep unfolding paradigm that focuses on exploring customized learnable priors, unlike most existing deep learning methods that use black box networks without considering intrinsic image priors. The use of learnable priors improves model transparency and interpretability.- The authors utilize a masked autoencoder (MAE) framework to pretrain illumination and noise priors based on specific target features relevant to low-light images. This is a novel approach not explored in prior work.- The learned priors are integrated in two ways - through the unfolding architecture design (structure flow) and as a loss function regularizer (optimization flow). This bidirectional integration of priors is unique.- Experiments show the method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches on multiple datasets. The customized priors demonstrate improved performance over standard proximal operators.- In addition to low-light enhancement, the experiments also validate the efficacy of the learned noise prior for general image denoising tasks by integrating it with existing denoising models. This extends the applicability of the proposed approach.Overall, the key novelty is the customized learnable priors via MAE and their integration to boost performance. This provides a new direction for interpretable deep unfolding models compared to black box learning models prevalent in this field. The impressive results substantiate the benefits of this paradigm.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several promising future research directions:- Exploring more effective network architectures and training strategies to further improve the performance of the deep unfolding paradigm for low-light image enhancement. For example, investigating different backbone networks and loss functions.- Generalizing the proposed learnable prior idea to other image processing tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, etc. The customized illumination and noise priors could potentially benefit other low-level vision tasks.- Designing more interpretable and customized priors for low-light image enhancement by analyzing the intrinsic properties of images captured in low-light conditions. There is still room to improve the transparency of deep unfolding solutions.- Extending the current paradigm to handle more challenging real low-light images, such as those with extreme noise or over-/under-exposure. The models can be trained on more diverse low-light image datasets. - Investigating how to incorporate semantic information to guide the low-light image enhancement process and further improve visual quality. The semantic priors may provide richer guidance.- Developing user-friendly systems and applications to deploy the low-light enhancement algorithms on mobile devices. This would improve the accessibility and usability of such methods.In summary, the main future directions are: 1) improving performance by exploring network architectures and training strategies; 2) generalizing to other tasks; 3) designing more customized and interpretable priors; 4) handling more complex real low-light images; 5) incorporating semantic information; and 6) enabling mobile applications. Advancing in these aspects can further push the boundaries of this field.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new paradigm for low-light image enhancement that explores the potential of customized learnable priors to improve the transparency and interpretability of deep unfolding networks. The method is called Customized Unfolding Enhancer (CUE). Motivated by the powerful feature representation capability of Masked Autoencoder (MAE), the authors customize MAE-based illumination and noise priors using a masked image modeling strategy. The illumination prior is trained to capture normal-light image properties, while the noise prior learns gradient representations irrelevant to lightness. These customized priors are integrated in two ways: 1) The illumination prior is embedded into the proximal operator design for Retinex decomposition to improve transparency. 2) The noise prior is redeveloped as a regularization term to constrain gradient consistency between enhanced and normal-light images to reduce noise. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate CUE's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. The noise prior also improves image denoising baselines when incorporated as a regularization term.In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: 1) Activates the potential of customized learnable priors for low-light image enhancement via a new deep unfolding paradigm. 2) Improves transparency by embedding an MAE-based illumination prior into the unfolding architecture. 3) Redevelops an MAE-based noise prior as a regularization for gradient consistency to reduce noise. 4) Shows state-of-the-art performance on two datasets and the ability to improve denoising baselines when incorporating the proposed priors. The key novelty is exploring customized learnable priors to make deep unfolding for low-light enhancement more transparent and effective.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper proposes a new paradigm for low-light image enhancement that explores the potential of customized learnable priors to improve the transparency of deep unfolding models. The method is called Customized Unfolding Enhancer (CUE). It utilizes a masked autoencoder (MAE) trained with a masked image modeling strategy to learn an illumination prior and a noise prior. The illumination prior is trained to predict the illumination map of a normal-light image filtered by a bilateral filter. This is embedded into the proximal operator of the illumination estimation step during Retinex decomposition to provide improved transparency. The noise prior is trained to predict the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features of a normal-light image. This is then used as a regularization term during optimization to constrain gradient consistency between the enhanced and normal-light images to help eliminate noise. By customizing the priors using MAE and incorporating them into the architecture via structure and optimization flows, CUE provides more interpretable and transparent deep unfolding for low-light enhancement.
