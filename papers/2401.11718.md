# [MsSVT++: Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer with Center Voting for 3D   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11718)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate 3D object detection in large-scale outdoor scenes with considerable variations in object scales requires features that are rich in both long-range and fine-grained information. Recent detectors using window-based transformers can model long-range dependencies but overlook fine-grained details. Bridging this gap is challenging.

Proposed Solution - MsSVT++:
The paper proposes a Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer (MsSVT++) that captures both types of information via a divide-and-conquer approach:

1. Explicitly divide attention heads into multiple groups, each responsible for attending within a specific range. Merge outputs to obtain final mixed-scale features.

2. Introduce Chessboard Sampling to reduce computational complexity of applying transformers in 3D voxel space. Sparsely implement sampling/gathering using hash maps.

3. Propose Center Voting module that directs voted voxels with mixed-scale context towards object centers (typically empty) to improve localization.

Main Contributions:

1. Novel MsSVT backbone network enabling abstraction of voxel features considering both context and details. 

2. Efficient Chessboard Sampling strategy and sparse implementation significantly reducing computational cost.

3. Introduction of Center Voting module, expanding capabilities of MsSVT, gathering context and directing it towards object centers to enhance accuracy.

The resulting MsSVT++ advances state-of-the-art in 3D detection, especially for large objects, with a single-stage detector built on it consistently outperforming recent two-stage detectors over diverse datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D object detection method called MsSVT++ that uses a mixed-scale sparse voxel transformer backbone to capture both long-range context and fine details in point clouds, and introduces a center voting module to improve localization of large objects by filling empty voxels at object centers with features aggregated from different object parts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a novel Mixed-scale Sparse Voxel Transformer (MsSVT) that enables the abstraction of voxel features while considering both long-range context and fine-grained details. 

2. It designs an efficient Chessboard Sampling strategy that significantly reduces the computational cost of applying a voxel-based transformer in 3D space. Additionally, all operations are implemented sparsely to enhance efficiency.

3. It introduces a novel Center Voting module, expanding the capabilities of MsSVT, which gathers mixed-scale contextual information and directs it towards object centers, typically occupied by empty voxels. The resulting MsSVT++ represents a noteworthy advancement in accurate 3D detection, particularly for large objects.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the MsSVT++ architecture that can effectively capture multi-scale contextual information in 3D voxel space for accurate 3D object detection, while also being computationally efficient. The Center Voting module further improves detection performance.
