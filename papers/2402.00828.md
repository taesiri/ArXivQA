# [Efficient Fine-tuning of Audio Spectrogram Transformers via Soft Mixture   of Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00828)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the problem of efficiently fine-tuning large pre-trained audio spectrogram transformer models like AST to downstream tasks. Fine-tuning the entire model is expensive and overfits when limited labeled data is available. Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods like adapters are limited by relying on a single adapter per layer. 

Proposed Solution
The paper proposes a Soft Mixture of Adapters (Soft-MoA) method that uses multiple lightweight adapters in each layer and routes input tokens to adapters via soft weighted combinations. This is more efficient than standard dense ensembling of adapters.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Soft-MoA method for PETL of AST using idea of soft routing from Soft Mixture of Experts (Soft-MoE).
- Achieves state-of-the-art results by improving 2.5% over single adapter methods on audio/speech tasks. 
- Matches performance of Dense-MoA while reducing computation by 3x.
- Provides ablation studies analyzing scaling trends and adapter contribution.
- Shows Soft-MoA works best with more adapters and few (1-2) slots, avoiding redundant learning.
- Demonstrates PETL methods like Soft-MoA are most beneficial when parameter budget is small.

In summary, the paper presents Soft-MoA as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning Audio Spectrogram Transformers to downstream tasks, outperforming single adapter approaches especially in low-resource regimes. The method is analyzed extensively via comparisons and ablations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Soft Mixture of Adapters (Soft-MoA), which uses multiple lightweight adapter modules as experts and a soft routing strategy between input tokens and experts, for efficient fine-tuning of Audio Spectrogram Transformers on audio and speech tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Soft Mixture of Adapters (Soft-MoA) for the efficient fine-tuning of Audio Spectrogram Transformers (AST) on audio and speech downstream tasks. Specifically:

- They propose to adapt the recent Soft Mixture of Experts (Soft-MoE) method to use multiple adapters as the experts and a soft assignment between input tokens and experts to reduce computational cost. This is called Soft-MoA.

- They compare Soft-MoA to using a single adapter and a dense version called Dense-MoA on 4 audio/speech benchmarks. The results show Soft-MoA matches Dense-MoA performance while significantly reducing training time, and outperforms the single adapter approach.

- They present ablation studies analyzing key elements of Soft-MoA, such as scaling behavior and contribution of experts. The studies show Soft-MoA achieves better scaling with more experts, ensures all experts contribute to prevent imbalance issues, and works best with few slots and more experts.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing Soft-MoA for efficient AST fine-tuning and demonstrating its effectiveness compared to single adapter and Dense-MoA approaches through extensive experiments and analysis.
