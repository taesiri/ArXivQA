# [SphereDiffusion: Spherical Geometry-Aware Distortion Resilient Diffusion   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10044)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SphereDiffusion: Spherical Geometry-Aware Distortion Resilient Diffusion Model":

Problem:
- Generating high-quality controllable spherical panoramic images is challenging due to two unique characteristics: spherical distortion and spherical geometry. 
- Spherical distortion causes objects to be deformed compared to planar images, making it difficult to utilize pre-trained models and extract effective features.  
- Spherical geometry such as rotation invariance and non-boundary property are not handled by existing planar image models.

Proposed Solution - SphereDiffusion
- Handles spherical distortion via two modules:
   - Distortion-Resilient Semantic Encoding (DRSE): Encodes semantics into distorted objects to align with pre-trained knowledge.  
   - Deformable Distortion-aware Block (DDaB): Uses deformable convolutions to extract features from distorted objects.
- Handles spherical geometry via:
   - Spherical Geometry-aware (SGA) Training: Enhances data diversity and optimization objectives to learn geometry. Includes Spherical Reprojection and Spherical SimSiam Contrastive Learning.
   - Spherical Geometry-aware (SGA) Generation: Utilizes spherical rotation invariance to improve boundary connectivity.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework SphereDiffusion that handles unique spherical distortion and geometry characteristics for generating controllable spherical panoramas
- DRSE and DDaB modules to deal with spherical distortion issues
- SGA Training and SGA Generation make model learn and utilize spherical geometry properties 
- Experiments show SphereDiffusion reduces FID by 35% over baselines for spherical panorama generation
