# [XUAT-Copilot: Multi-Agent Collaborative System for Automated User   Acceptance Testing with Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional manual user acceptance testing (UAT) for software is time-consuming and error-prone. 
- The authors have developed an automated UAT system called XUAT for WeChat Pay, but it still requires significant manual effort for test script generation.

Proposed Solution - XUAT-Copilot System
- Uses large language models (LLMs) to power a multi-agent collaborative system to automate test script generation.
- Main components:
   - Perception Module: Captures UI state information 
   - Rewriting Module: Rewrites test case steps to be more understandable
   - Three LLM-based agents:
     1. Operation agent: Plans user actions and generates commands
     2. Parameter selection agent: Chooses parameters  
     3. Inspection agent: Checks if step goal is accomplished
- Agents interact collaboratively in a complex way to handle different sub-tasks
- Self-reflection mechanism to correct invalid actions

Key Contributions:
- First work to apply LLMs to automate user acceptance testing
- Proposed a novel multi-agent architecture tailored for UAT automation
- Significantly improved automation level of test script generation for WeChat Pay app
- Reduced manual effort and improved efficiency in the UAT process

The summary covers the key details on the problem being solved, the proposed XUAT-Copilot system and its components for automating test script generation through an LLM-powered multi-agent approach, and highlights the main contributions around using LLMs for UAT automation and improving efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes XUAT-Copilot, an LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative system to automate user acceptance testing for WeChat Pay mobile application.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose the first system, to the best of their knowledge, that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the test script generation process in user acceptance testing (UAT). This demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs for automated UAT.

2. A novel multi-agent collaborative system called XUAT-Copilot is proposed that consists of three LLM-based agents for action planning, parameter selection, and state checking, along with additional modules for state sensing and case rewriting. This system achieves close effectiveness to human testers.

3. The proposed XUAT-Copilot system has been applied to the real research and development environment of WeChat Pay, a mobile payment application with billions of users. This is shown to improve testing efficiency and save considerable manual effort.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing the first LLM-powered automated UAT system, the innovative multi-agent architecture of XUAT-Copilot, and the demonstration of efficiency improvements in a real-world large-scale deployment.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the current XUAT system is still semi-automated and labor-intensive at the test script implementation stage. What are some key challenges in fully automating this stage? 

2. The paper proposes a multi-agent architecture consisting of an operation agent, parameter selection agent, and inspection agent. What is the rationale behind decomposing the task into these specific sub-tasks handled by separate agents?

3. The operation agent incorporates a self-reflection mechanism to correct invalid actions. How does this mechanism work and why is it important for improving the agent's performance? 

4. The paper extracts only certain attributes from the raw view hierarchy to represent the state/UI page observed by the agents. What attributes are selected and what is the reasoning behind the selection criteria?

5. For widgets with hyperlinks, the paper uses additional image processing to extract bounds. Explain this image processing pipeline and why it is needed to locate the correct clickable areas.

6. The rewriting module reformulates the raw test case instructions to make them more understandable by the agents. What is the process and what types of rewrite rules are applied? 

7. The prompts for each agent have a specific structure consisting of different components. Explain the key components and their roles in guiding the agent's behavior.

8. How do the three agents collaborate and interact within the overall algorithm? Explain the workflow and how each agent contributes to the goal of generating valid action sequences.

9. How were the skill library functions designed? What capabilities do they encapsulate and why is providing descriptions important? 

10. The paper demonstrates superior performance over a single-agent baseline. Analyze the limitations of a single-agent approach for this task and why the multi-agent architecture works better.
