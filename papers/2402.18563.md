# [Approaching Human-Level Forecasting with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18563)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Forecasting future events is critical for decision making across domains, but relies heavily on scarce and expensive human judgment. Automating accurate forecasting can thus help inform institutional decisions. However, current AI systems significantly underperform even average human forecasters. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper develops an end-to-end pipeline with three key components - information retrieval, reasoning, and aggregation. It uses language models (LMs) for retrieval to search relevant articles, summarize them, and rank by relevance. The top articles are input to an LM trained via self-supervision to generate probability forecasts and natural language rationales. Multiple LMs generate predictions which are aggregated via trimmed mean.

The system is optimized on a new dataset of 5,500 real-world forecasting questions from competitive platforms. A test set with questions strictly after June 2023 prevents model leakage. 

Main Contributions:
- Compiles the largest and most recent benchmark for forecasting, spanning diverse domains.

- Builds an optimized retrieval mechanism using LMs for search, summarization and relevance ranking.

- Proposes a self-supervised fine-tuning method for LMs to produce accurate forecasts and rationales. 

- Develops an end-to-end system that approaches and sometimes exceeds human-level forecasting performance.

The results demonstrate that with careful optimization, LMs can automate judgmental forecasting at high quality. This enables low-cost, rapid and accurate forecasts to inform decisions across domains.
