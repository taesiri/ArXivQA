# [The METRIC-framework for assessing data quality for trustworthy AI in   medicine: a systematic review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13635)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning (ML) models rely heavily on the quality of their training data. Poor quality data leads to poor model performance ("garbage in, garbage out").
- Assessing data quality is particularly important for safety-critical applications like healthcare/medicine. 
- However, there is no standardized framework for systematically evaluating the quality of medical training data for ML.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors perform a systematic literature review to synthesize knowledge and perspectives on data quality from different fields.
- They extract key data quality concepts and dimensions from 62 relevant studies.
- Based on this, they propose the "METRIC" framework - a specialized set of 15 awareness dimensions to assess medical training data quality.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a formalized, comprehensive set of criteria to evaluate medical ML training data along five key clusters: Measurement Process, Timeliness, Representativeness, Informativeness, Consistency.
- Defines and gives context to 15 granular data quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, dataset size, class balance, etc.
- Shows how each dimension links to ML model behavior like fairness, robustness and interpretability.
- Gives guidance on quantitative vs qualitative assessment and dimensions that likely have bigger impact.
- Can inform regulatory approval of ML systems by incorporating systematic data quality checks.
- Sets the stage for developing complete processes and tools to improve medical dataset quality.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in understanding medical data quality for trustworthy ML, proposing the first specialized framework, and highlighting its relevance for model developers and regulators.
