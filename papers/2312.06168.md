# [Motion Planning for Multiple Mobile Manipulator System in Complex   Flipping Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06168)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel motion planning framework for multiple mobile manipulator systems to accomplish complex object manipulation tasks such as flipping. The key idea is to address the configuration disconnectivity problem of manipulators under closed-chain constraints by incorporating regrasping and platform motions. The framework classifies robot trajectories into two types: mobile manipulator planning where the platform moves to maintain configuration connectivity, and regrasping planning where the robot changes grasping positions. Corresponding optimization-based methods are designed for both trajectories to enhance subsequent planning. The overall framework allows adjusting task priorities between the two trajectories and outputs complete motions for the robots given predefined object trajectories and grasping positions. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the framework in planning flipping manipulations. Limitations regarding completeness and pre-specified inputs are discussed, and future work includes addressing these and integration of practical issues like load distribution.
