# [Motion Planning for Multiple Mobile Manipulator System in Complex   Flipping Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06168)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel motion planning framework for multiple mobile manipulator systems to accomplish complex object manipulation tasks such as flipping. The key idea is to address the configuration disconnectivity problem of manipulators under closed-chain constraints by incorporating regrasping and platform motions. The framework classifies robot trajectories into two types: mobile manipulator planning where the platform moves to maintain configuration connectivity, and regrasping planning where the robot changes grasping positions. Corresponding optimization-based methods are designed for both trajectories to enhance subsequent planning. The overall framework allows adjusting task priorities between the two trajectories and outputs complete motions for the robots given predefined object trajectories and grasping positions. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the framework in planning flipping manipulations. Limitations regarding completeness and pre-specified inputs are discussed, and future work includes addressing these and integration of practical issues like load distribution.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for multiple mobile manipulator systems (MMMS) in complex manipulation tasks such as flipping large objects. Such tasks impose closed-chain constraints on the system which limits the feasible motions of the manipulators and causes configuration disconnectivity issues. Existing methods either rely heavily on regrasping which has efficiency and stability concerns, or do not fully utilize the mobility of the platforms to address the configuration disconnectivity problem.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel motion planning framework for MMMS that incorporates both platform motions and regrasping to enhance configuration connectivity. The key aspects are:

1) Classify robot trajectories into two types during manipulation - Platform Motion Trajectories and Regrasping Trajectories. Assign different priorities to them based on task requirements.

2) Design a Mobile Manipulator Planner that primarily uses manipulator motions, and brings in platform motions only when manipulator approaches disconnectivity boundaries. An optimization method is used to determine platform motions that ensure configuration connectivity.

3) Design a Regrasping Planner that temporarily disregards closed-chain constraints and selects optimal regrasp configuration using a manipulability metric to facilitate subsequent planning.

4) Integrate the two planners into an overall framework that takes object trajectory and grasp positions as inputs, and outputs complete robot trajectories by invoking the above planners based on specified trajectory priorities.

Main Contributions:

- A planning framework for MMMS that realizes complex manipulation tasks by effectively utilizing both platform motions and regrasping.

- Addresses configuration disconnectivity issue in manipulators under closed-chain constraints.

- Provides flexibility to set trajectory priorities and enhance connectivity.

- Demonstrates, through simulations and experiments, the framework's ability to efficiently plan motions for flipping tasks that may not be possible with fixed manipulators or without regrasping.

The limitations and future work directions are also discussed. Overall, this paper makes significant contributions towards motion planning of MMMS in complex manipulation scenarios.
