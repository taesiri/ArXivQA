# [Boosting Verified Training for Robust Image Classifications via   Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11552)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to efficiently train neural networks that are provably robust against adversarial perturbations. 

The key hypothesis is that training neural networks on abstracted interval representations of the input data, rather than on the raw input data, will result in models that are more robust to small perturbations.

Specifically, the paper proposes:

1) An abstraction-based training method where perturbed images are mapped to intervals before being fed into the neural network. By training on intervals, the variance of the training data is reduced, resulting in smoother loss landscapes and more robust models. 

2) A formal verification method that leverages the abstraction to efficiently verify the robustness guarantees of models trained with their approach.

3) Tuning the granularity of the abstraction as a way to trade off robustness and accuracy. Coarser abstractions lead to smoother models while finer abstractions preserve more detail.

4) Evaluating their training and verification methods on image classification benchmarks, showing improved robustness and efficiency compared to prior interval bound propagation techniques.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that abstraction can enable efficient and scalable training of provably robust deep neural networks for image classification. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed techniques and extensive empirical evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel abstraction-based training method for robust image classification. The key idea is to map perturbed images to intervals before feeding them into the neural network for training. This allows the model to be provably robust within the perturbation bound. 

2. It provides a companion black-box verification method to certify the robustness of models trained with the proposed approach. The verification is efficient and scalable since it treats the model as a black box.

3. It implements the training and verification methods in a tool called AbsCert.

4. It conducts extensive experiments on various benchmarks at different scales. The results demonstrate that AbsCert can train models with lower verified errors, less overhead, and good scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is an abstraction-based training framework that can improve model robustness with efficiency and scalability. The black-box verification and tool implementation also enable practical application of the approach. The comprehensive evaluation convincingly demonstrates the advantages over existing methods.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR paper compares to other related research:

- The paper proposes a new robust training method called AbsCert that uses abstraction to map perturbed images to intervals before feeding them into the neural network for training. This is a novel approach compared to prior robust training methods like adversarial training, which augment the training data with adversarial examples. 

- The key advantage of AbsCert seems to be that it can train models with much lower verified errors compared to state-of-the-art methods like LossLandscapeMatters, LBP&Ramp, and AdvIBP. The experiments show very significant improvements in verified robustness across different benchmarks. This is an important advancement over prior work.

- Additionally, AbsCert's blackbox verification approach based on the abstraction makes it more efficient and scalable than methods relying on symbolic interval propagation. The paper shows orders of magnitude speedups compared to competitors. This helps address a major weakness of prior verification-based training methods.

- The method is also shown to be applicable to different network architectures beyond standard CNNs, like fully connected networks with sigmoid/tanh activations. And it scales to large ImageNet models like ResNet18 with 138 million parameters, which many verification methods cannot handle.

- Overall, AbsCert appears to be a very promising new technique that pushes the state-of-the-art in verified robust training. The innovations of using abstraction for training and blackbox verification seem to provide substantial improvements in precision, efficiency, generality and scalability compared to related work. If validated, this could be an impactful new direction for provable defenses against adversarial attacks. The thorough benchmarking against competitive baselines is also a strength.

In summary, this paper introduces well-motivated new techniques to address limitations of prior arts and demonstrates excellent results. It likely represents important progress in training verifiably robust neural networks. The community would benefit from open-sourcing AbsCert to further build upon this research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Refining the abstraction granularity using information from the verification process: The paper mentions that the abstraction granularity is a key hyperparameter for training robust models. They suggest exploring new mechanisms to find the optimal abstraction granularity, such as using the verification results to guide the refinement of the granularity. This could lead to models with even lower verified error.

- Applying the approach to other domains beyond image classification: The authors demonstrate their method on image classification tasks, but suggest it could likely be applied more broadly to train robust models in other domains like natural language processing. Exploring the generalization of the approach is proposed. 

- Investigating other abstraction functions: The paper uses a simple element-wise abstraction function that maps pixel values to intervals. The authors suggest studying other more complex abstraction functions and their impact on model robustness.

- Scaling up the approach: While results are shown on large 138M parameter models, the authors propose continued work on scaling the approach to even larger state-of-the-art models.

- Tightening the verification bounds: Since the verification relies on propagating abstract intervals, tighter verification bounds could potentially be achieved by enhancing the abstraction function or verification techniques.

- Comparing to other verification methods: The paper focuses on comparison to other training methods. Comparing the verification approach to other exact or incomplete verification techniques could further demonstrate its efficiency and scalability.

In summary, the main future directions involve refining the core techniques of abstraction and verification, generalizing the approach to new domains and models, and continuing to scale up the methods. Overall, the paper sets the stage for significant follow-on work to build on the proposed abstraction-based training and verification framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This CVPR 2023 paper proposes a novel abstraction-based certified training method for robust image classifications. The key idea is to map perturbed images into intervals before feeding them into neural networks for training. By training on intervals, all perturbed images mapped to the same interval are classified the same, reducing variance and smoothing the loss landscape. The approach enables sound and complete black-box verification that is scalable to arbitrary network types and sizes. The method is implemented in a tool called AbsCert and evaluated on benchmarks, showing significantly reduced verified errors (up to 95.64% reduction) and faster training and verification (up to 602.5x speedup) compared to state-of-the-art methods. The approach also scales up to larger 138 million parameter models. Overall, abstraction-based training and verification improves robustness guarantees for image classifiers.
