## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems in the convex case, focusing specifically on the boundary value problem of finding T-periodic solutions. The goal is to establish conditions for the existence and uniqueness of non-trivial periodic solutions.

Proposed Solution:
The paper utilizes a duality approach, transforming the problem to minimizing a dual action functional defined on a certain function space. Sufficient conditions are derived involving the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian that ensure a non-constant periodic solution exists by precluding the trivial solution from being a minimizer.

Main Contributions:

- Gives sufficient conditions for existence of non-trivial T-periodic solutions to autonomous Hamiltonian systems based on a dual action formulation. 

- For the (a_infty, b_infty)-subquadratic case, shows solution exists if an inequality relating the period T, the eigenvalues a_infty, b_infty and the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian is satisfied.

- Demonstrates the minimality of the period of solutions found by the dual method.

- Extends the approach to forced Hamiltonian systems with external periodic forcing.

- Refines and expands earlier works utilizing dual methods for establishing non-triviality of periodic solutions in subquadratic Hamiltonian systems.

In summary, the main contribution is providing existence conditions for non-constant periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems by a dual variational approach and demonstrating the minimality property of the obtained solutions. Both autonomous and forced systems are studied.
