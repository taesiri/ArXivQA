# [RAVE: Randomized Noise Shuffling for Fast and Consistent Video Editing   with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04524)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents RAVE, a novel zero-shot text-guided video editing method that leverages pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models without requiring additional training. RAVE introduces a noise shuffling strategy that efficiently harnesses spatio-temporal interactions between frames to achieve temporally consistent video edits around 25% faster than existing approaches. Specifically, it arranges the input video frames into grids, performs diffusion sampling on these shuffled grids guided by the text prompt, and sequences the output frames into the final edited video. Compared to sparse attention mechanisms in prior works, RAVE's shuffling enables efficient global spatio-temporal attention throughout all frames, ensuring consistency even for long input videos. Extensive experiments highlight RAVE's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in maintaining frame consistency and alignment to text prompts. The newly introduced video dataset spans diverse scenarios with varying lengths and motions. The code, videos, and dataset are publicly released to facilitate standardized evaluation and promote further advances in this emerging research direction.
