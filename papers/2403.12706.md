# [AnimateDiff-Lightning: Cross-Model Diffusion Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12706)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video generation models like AnimateDiff can produce amazing results, but they are often very slow due to the iterative diffusion sampling process. For example, generating a 10-second video with AnimateDiff + stylized image model can take more than 10 minutes. Making video generation faster while retaining quality is the main focus.

Solution:
The paper proposes AnimateDiff-Lightning, which applies progressive adversarial diffusion distillation to video for the first time. Specifically:

1) It distills the whole AnimateDiff model including base image model and motion module as a single model. The distillation is trained on the motion module alone, no need for an additional LoRA module on image model.

2) It proposes cross-model distillation, which distills the motion module on multiple base models simultaneously. This improves generalization to different unseen stylized base models compared to distilling only on the default base model.

3) The distilled motion module with 2/4 steps matches or outperforms the previous state-of-the-art video diffusion distillation model AnimateLCM with 8 steps. The module also retains compatibility with components like ControlNet, Motion LoRA, etc.

Main Contributions:

1) Achieves new state-of-the-art in few-step high-quality video generation, enabling lightning-fast video workflows. 

2) Applies progressive adversarial diffusion distillation to video generation for the first time.

3) Proposes cross-model distillation technique to create a shared motion module with broader style compatibility.

4) Releases distilled AnimateDiff-Lightning models for community use to facilitate advancements.

In summary, the paper presents a fast video generation model enabling creative possibilities that were previously too slow, through novel application of diffusion distillation techniques tailored for the video modality.
