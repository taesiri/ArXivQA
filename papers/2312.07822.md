# [Prototypical Self-Explainable Models Without Re-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07822)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes KMEx, a simple yet efficient method to convert any pre-trained black-box model into a prototypical self-explainable model (PSEM) without needing to retrain the base model. PSEMs provide inherent global and local explanations through visualizable class-representative prototypes. To facilitate adoption of PSEMs, KMEx keeps the trained encoder intact, learns prototypes via clustering in the embedding space, and replaces the classifier with a transparent nearest-neighbor one. Experiments across datasets show KMEx matches the black-box performance while offering interpretability. The paper also introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in PSEM predicates - transparency, diversity and trustworthiness. Using novel metrics, the framework exposes issues overlooked before, like unused "ghosted" prototypes giving false sense of model concepts. Most importantly, it enables objective comparison of model strengths/weaknesses. For example, KMEx suffers little ghosting and is most faithful to the black-box, while other PSEMs have tradeoffs. Overall, KMEx offers an efficient PSEM baseline to build on, and the evaluation framework paves way toward reliable and objective advancement of self-explainable AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes KMEx, a simple yet efficient universal method to convert any existing pre-trained model into a prototypical self-explainable model without retraining, and introduces a quantitative evaluation framework to compare self-explainable models based on the predicates of transparency, diversity, and trustworthiness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a simple yet efficient method called KMEx (K-Means Explainer) that can convert any existing pre-trained model into a prototypical self-explainable model (PSEM) without needing to retrain the base model. This facilitates wider applicability of SEMs.

2. Proposing a novel quantitative evaluation framework for PSEMs to allow for more objective and comprehensive comparisons between different SEM approaches. The framework is based on validating the predicates of transparency, diversity, and trustworthiness.

So in summary, the main contributions are (1) an efficient method to convert black-box models into self-explainable models, and (2) a standardized evaluation framework to compare different self-explainable models. The key advantage of KMEx is enabling reuse of existing trained models to make them interpretable without alteration or retraining.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Explainable AI (XAI) has evolved along two trajectories - post-hoc methods that explain predictions of pre-trained models, and self-explainable models (SEMs) that provide inherent explanations. Post-hoc methods are simple to use but unreliable. SEMs are reliable but require complex architectures and training. This limits their accessibility and usage.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a simple yet efficient universal method called KMEx (K-Means Explainer) to convert any pre-trained model into a prototypical SEM. KMEx keeps the encoder intact, learns prototypes via k-means clustering in the embedding space, and replaces the classifier with a nearest neighbor one based on prototypes. This results in an SEM with performance similar to original model but with inherent interpretability, without retraining the model.

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes KMEx, the first approach to transform a black-box model into a self-explainable prototypical model without retraining. KMEx is simple, efficient and fulfills predicates of transparency, diversity and trustworthiness.

2. Proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in SEM predicates to objectively compare models. New metrics are introduced to quantify prototype ghosting, faithfulness of explanations w.r.t black-box model, and diversity based on model's own similarity measure.  

3. Evaluation shows KMEx matches black-box performance while offering interpretability. Analysis using new metrics highlights strengths/weaknesses of KMEx and other SEMs. KMEx explanations are shown to be most faithful to black-box model. Transforming any SEM to its KMEx counterpart is shown to improve diversity.
