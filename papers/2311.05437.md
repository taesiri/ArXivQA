## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph for the paper:

This paper presents LLaVA-Plus, a multimodal assistant that learns to plug and use a diverse set of vision and vision-language skills to complete a wide range of real-world tasks. The key idea is to equip a large multimodal model (LMM) like LLaVA with a repository of pre-trained specialist models that can be dynamically selected and composed to handle complex instructions. To acquire the skill of tool usage, LLaVA-Plus is trained on a large corpus of instruction-following data comprising vision-language examples of tool invocation, execution, and result aggregation. The data covers compositional skills including visual understanding, generation, knowledge retrieval, and their combinations. Experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-Plus outperforms LLaVA and other methods on existing capabilities, and also exhibits strong emergent skills in diverse new scenarios like image editing, conditional generation, and creating social media posts. Compared to prompting-based tool usage, LLaVA-Plus grounds image inputs throughout the interaction for superior planning. The work represents an integration of end-to-end training and tool chaining to develop adaptable multimodal agents. Key assets including data, code, and models will be open-sourced.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary:

The paper presents LLaVA-Plus, a general-purpose multimodal assistant that expands the capabilities of large multimodal models by maintaining a skill repository and learning to select, activate, and compose relevant skills on the fly to fulfill real-world vision and vision-language tasks.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can large language models like LLMs be extended to become more capable and flexible multimodal assistants that can understand and reason about visual information?

The key hypothesis appears to be: 

By equipping LLMs with a diverse repository of visual skills/tools and training them end-to-end on multimodal instruction-following data, LLMs can learn to dynamically select and activate the appropriate skills to fulfill a wide range of real-world vision and vision-language tasks.

Specifically, the paper introduces LLaVA-Plus, which enhances the LLaVA model by incorporating external vision tools/skills that can be invoked on-the-fly during human-AI interactions. LLaVA-Plus is trained on newly curated instruction-following data covering tool use for visual understanding, generation, knowledge retrieval, and their compositions. 

The central hypothesis is that by learning when and how to leverage these diverse skills, LLaVA-Plus will exhibit improved performance on existing capabilities compared to base LLaVA, while also gaining a number of new capabilities not present before. Experiments seem to validate this hypothesis, showing systematic improvement over LLaVA and new state-of-the-art results.

In summary, the paper explores whether end-to-end training of LLMs on tool use data can produce more capable and flexible multimodal agents - this appears to be the central research question and hypothesis. LLaVA-Plus is presented as a successful embodiment of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Curating a new multimodal instruction-following tool use dataset that covers many examples of visual understanding, generation, external knowledge retrieval and their compositions. This dataset is dedicated for training large multimodal models to learn to use tools and skills. 

2. Developing LLaVA-Plus, a general-purpose multimodal assistant that extends LLaVA by incorporating a diverse set of external tools that can be selected, composed and activated on the fly. LLaVA-Plus maintains a skill repository and learns to leverage relevant tools given users' multimodal inputs.

3. Demonstrating that LLaVA-Plus outperforms LLaVA and other models on existing capabilities and exhibits new capabilities enabled by learning to use tools, including object detection, segmentation, external knowledge retrieval, image generation/editing, and their compositions.

4. Proposing a new training scheme of "visual instruction tuning" that teaches large multimodal models to actively use skills and tools throughout the human-AI interaction process, instead of only using visual signals when tools are invoked as in prior work.

5. Releasing several key assets to facilitate future research, including the multimodal instruction dataset, codebase, LLaVA-Plus model checkpoints, and a visual chat demo.

In summary, the core contribution is developing and validating a framework and training methodology for expanding large multimodal models' capabilities by teaching them to leverage diverse skills and tools in a flexible, compositional manner via visual instruction tuning. The released datasets, models and code aim to provide useful resources to the community as well.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new approach to developing general-purpose multimodal AI assistants by combining end-to-end training of large multimodal models (LMMs) with the modular use of pre-trained skills. It differs from prior work in this field in several key ways:

1. Compared to end-to-end trained LMMs like LLaVA, Flamingo, and GPT-4, this paper proposes augmenting the LMM with a modular "skill repository" that allows it to invoke specialized visual tools as needed. This provides more flexibility to expand capabilities by adding new skills, without retraining the entire model.

2. Compared to systems that rely solely on chaining visual tools with large language models like MM-REACT and VisualChatGPT, this paper trains the LMM end-to-end to select and use tools appropriately. The raw visual input is available throughout the interaction, rather than only when tools are invoked, which improves planning/reasoning.

3. The paper contributes a new dataset of visual instruction-following examples for training tool use skills. Prior work has not focused on curating tool usage data.

4. The proposed LLaVA-Plus model achieves state-of-the-art results on VisIT-Bench and outperforms LLaVA on other benchmarks. It shows stronger generalization and more versatile capabilities than prior end-to-end LMMs.

5. The modular design allows new tools/skills to be added easily through additional instruction tuning, rather than full model retraining. This provides a path to expand capabilities on demand.

Overall, this work combines strengths of end-to-end training and modular tool chaining in a novel way. The results demonstrate improved performance over prior end-to-end LMMs, while also showing new emergent capabilities from tool usage. The modular design provides a framework to systematically expand skills as new tools become available.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing approaches to make multimodal assistant systems more reliable and reduce issues such as hallucinations or tool conflicts. The paper notes that while LLaVA-Plus shows impressive capabilities, it can sometimes exhibit unreliable behaviors. Methods to enhance reliability could be an important avenue for future work.

- Expanding the breadth and diversity of skills and tools that can be incorporated. The authors propose a modular architecture that can flexibly combine different skills, but expanding the types of skills supported could further increase versatility.

- Improving generalization and transfer learning with new skills/tools. The paper demonstrates adding new skills via instruction tuning on domain-specific data. Research on how to increase transfer and enable incorporating new skills with less data could be valuable.

- Studying how to optimize workflow construction and tool selection/composition. LLaVA-Plus shows ability to construct workflows and select tools, but further work could be done to enable more dynamic optimization of tool selection and chaining.

- Enabling more natural engagement and grounding throughout interactions. LLaVA-Plus uses visual inputs throughout but further research could explore how to make interactions more natural, intuitive and grounded.

- Reducing training data requirements and enabling unsupervised or semi-supervised skill learning. The instruction tuning approach requires large training sets. Methods to learn skills with less labeled data could help increase feasibility.

- Exploring alternative system architectures. The authors propose an initial modular architecture but further architectural explorations could provide benefits.

Overall, the authors lay out an exciting research agenda focused on improving the flexibility, reliability and scalability of large multimodal assistant systems through innovations in architectures, skill learning approaches, interaction grounding, and more.
