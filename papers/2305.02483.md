# [ChatGPT-steered Editing Instructor for Customization of Abstractive   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:How can we effectively customize and improve the outputs of large language models like ChatGPT to better align with user needs and expectations? Specifically, the key hypotheses are:1) Large language models like ChatGPT can effectively serve as generators and editors in a generate-and-edit pipeline.2) Training a small instructor model using editor-steered reinforcement learning can produce instructions tailored to user needs that successfully guide large language model editors. 3) The proposed tri-agent pipeline of generator - instructor - editor can improve the quality of generated text to fulfill user requirements.The paper explores these hypotheses through experiments on abstractive text summarization, assessing whether the edited summaries better meet user criteria for coverage and factual consistency compared to the initial summaries. The instructor model is the key novel component proposed to steer the editing process towards user needs.
