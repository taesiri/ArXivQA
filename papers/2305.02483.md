# [ChatGPT-steered Editing Instructor for Customization of Abstractive   Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02483)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we effectively customize and improve the outputs of large language models like ChatGPT to better align with user needs and expectations? 

Specifically, the key hypotheses are:

1) Large language models like ChatGPT can effectively serve as generators and editors in a generate-and-edit pipeline.

2) Training a small instructor model using editor-steered reinforcement learning can produce instructions tailored to user needs that successfully guide large language model editors. 

3) The proposed tri-agent pipeline of generator - instructor - editor can improve the quality of generated text to fulfill user requirements.

The paper explores these hypotheses through experiments on abstractive text summarization, assessing whether the edited summaries better meet user criteria for coverage and factual consistency compared to the initial summaries. The instructor model is the key novel component proposed to steer the editing process towards user needs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a tri-agent generation pipeline consisting of a generator, instructor, and editor to enhance the customization of abstractive summarization outputs. Specifically:

- They propose using an inference-only large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT as both the generator and editor, while using a smaller model as an instructor to guide the editing process. 

- The instructor is trained with editor-steered reinforcement learning to optimize instruction generation for guiding the editor LLM. The reward directly quantifies how well the edited output fulfills user requirements.

- They conduct experiments on two summarization datasets, showing the pipeline can improve alignment with user requirements related to coverage and factual consistency compared to both the initial summaries and LLM-generated instructions alone.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a generation framework that decomposes the process into generator, instructor, and editor components in order to leverage the capabilities of large LLMs while allowing for user-specific customization via a trained instructor optimized for a particular editor LLM.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a three-agent pipeline for text generation consisting of a generator, instructor, and editor, where a small model is trained as an instructor to provide editing instructions tailored to user needs, guiding a large language model editor to refine the initial output from the generator to better align with user expectations, as evaluated on abstractive text summarization tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on improving customization of large language model outputs:

- The tri-agent pipeline proposed in this paper builds on prior work like Self-Refine (Madaan et al. 2023) that decompose the generation process into separate components. However, this paper introduces a novel three-component structure consisting of a generator, instructor, and editor. 

- Using a separate small instructor model to generate editing instructions is a unique aspect not seen in related works. This allows leveraging large LM capabilities while using smaller models where fine-tuning large LMs is infeasible. 

- The editor-steered reinforcement learning to train the instructor model is also novel. Related work has not explicitly optimized the instructor model to be compatible with the editor LM.

- For summarization, this paper focuses on customizing outputs to user needs like coverage and factual consistency. Related summarization work either uses large LMs in a zero-shot setting or trains supervised models, without tailoring to user specs.

- The iterative editing process explored allows continuously refining outputs to better meet user needs. Most related work focuses on one-step editing.

- Compared to other text editing techniques requiring human-labeled data or editing chains, this work operates at a more abstract level using natural language instructions.

In summary, the key novelties are the tri-agent pipeline structure, editor-steered RL for the instructor, focus on customization to user needs for summarization, and iterative editing process. The overall approach aims to effectively leverage large LMs while accounting for their constraints.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend the experiments to other tasks beyond text summarization, such as wiki-editing, news-editing, and mathematical problem synthesis. The tri-agent pipeline proposed in this work is a general framework that could be applied to various text generation tasks.

- Generate more instruction data using techniques like self-instruction to train a better instructor model. The authors note that having more high-quality training data for the instructor would likely lead to improved performance.

- Explore additional methods for training the instructor, such as by incorporating demonstrations from human experts or other techniques from imitation learning. 

- Experiment with different model architectures and training techniques for the instructor model to identify the most effective approaches.

- Evaluate the framework with a wider range of user requirements beyond just coverage and factual consistency. The generality of the pipeline makes it amenable to integrating diverse user needs.

- Conduct further analysis to understand the tradeoffs between one-step versus iterative editing. The relative benefits of each approach could depend on factors like the task, user needs, and models used.

- Deploy and evaluate the pipeline in real-world applications to assess its viability and usefulness for end users. Testing the framework in applied settings would provide valuable feedback.

- Explore methods to make the instructor model more user-adaptive over time as it collects more interactions with specific users. Personalization could further enhance customization.

In summary, the authors propose a number of promising directions to build upon this work, including enhancements to the instructor model, evaluation across more tasks and requirements, iteration between the components, and real-world deployment. Advancing research along these fronts could further improve the performance and flexibility of the tri-agent generation pipeline.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a tri-agent generation pipeline to enhance customization of abstractive summarization outputs using large language models like ChatGPT. The pipeline consists of a generator, instructor, and editor. The generator produces an initial summary, then a small instructor model generates editing instructions tailored to user needs, and finally the editor refines the summary based on the instructions. ChatGPT serves as both the generator and editor, while a smaller model is trained as the user-specific instructor. The instructor is trained in two phases - first supervised on human instructions then fine-tuned via editor-steered reinforcement learning to optimize instruction generation for the editor model. Experiments on summarization datasets DeFacto and CNNDM show the pipeline can improve alignment of summaries with user requirements for coverage and factual consistency. The approach allows leveraging large language models while using smaller models to provide targeted editing guidance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel three-component pipeline for generating and editing text to align with user needs. The first component is a generator model that produces an initial output. The second is an instructor model that analyzes the initial output and generates editing instructions tailored to the user's requirements. The third is an editor model that refines the initial output by following the instructions from the instructor. 

The key idea is to leverage large language models like ChatGPT for the complex tasks of generation and editing, while using a smaller model as the instructor. The instructor is trained using editor-steered reinforcement learning - its reward is based on the editor's performance, so it learns to give instructions that improve the editor's outputs. Experiments on summarization datasets show this approach can customize summaries for coverage and factual consistency. The paper demonstrates the potential of decomposing generation into three specialized agents, allowing larger models to be used for complex tasks while smaller models handle specificity. Future work involves testing this pipeline on other tasks and generating more training data through self-instruction.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a tri-agent pipeline for text generation that consists of a generator, an instructor, and an editor. The generator produces an initial output text. Then a small instructor model generates editing instructions to customize the initial output to user needs. Finally, the editor, implemented using a large language model like ChatGPT, edits the initial output following the instructions to produce a revised text better aligned with user expectations. The instructor is trained in two phases - first using supervised learning on human-authored instructions, then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning using rewards based on the edited text quality. This allows the instructor to generate instructions tailored to guiding the editor model. Experiments on abstractive text summarization demonstrate that the edited summaries better meet requirements on coverage and factual consistency compared to the initial summaries.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of customizing the outputs of large language models like ChatGPT to meet specific user needs. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, a key limitation of large LMs is that their outputs do not consistently satisfy user requirements or expectations. 

The paper proposes a new framework involving three components - a generator, an instructor, and an editor - to enhance the customization of outputs to user needs. The key ideas are:

- Leverage large LMs like ChatGPT for the complex tasks of content generation and editing/correction. This allows utilizing their strong generative capabilities.

- Use a smaller model as an instructor to generate user-specific instructions to guide the editing process. This allows customizing the outputs to user needs.

- Train the instructor model using editor-steered reinforcement learning to optimize instructions based on editor performance. This enhances compatibility with the editor. 

The framework is designed to account for constraints like limited compute resources and restricted model access when working with large LMs.

So in summary, the paper aims to address the problem of better customizing large LM outputs to user needs, proposing a tri-agent generate-instruct-edit framework to achieve this. The instructor model is key to providing user-specific guidance.
