# [Online Influence Maximization: Concept and Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Online Influence Maximization: Concept and Algorithm":

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the problem of influence maximization (IM) in social networks when the underlying diffusion model parameters are unknown. Traditional IM methods assume the diffusion probabilities are known, which is unrealistic. The online IM problem involves sequentially selecting seed nodes to maximize influence spread over multiple rounds, while simultaneously learning the unknown diffusion parameters from observed feedback.

Key Challenges
The key challenges are: (1) Complex social dynamics making diffusion hard to model; (2) Data scarcity and biases making parameter estimation difficult; (3) Adaptive user behaviors causing parameters to vary over time; (4) Diversity of user influence types. 

Online IM Framework
The online IM framework has six key characteristics: (1) Iterative learning over rounds; (2) Updating model parameters based on observed outcomes; (3) Progressively optimizing seed selection; (4) Adapting to network changes; (5) Balancing exploration and exploitation; (6) Addressing computational challenges.

Mathematical Modeling
Online IM is modeled as a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit problem with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T). In this model, base arms represent network connections, super arms represent seed sets, rewards represent influence spread. The learner selects a seed set, observes feedback on triggered connections, updates parameters, and repeats. Regret bounds characterize the cumulative difference between the algorithm's performance and the optimal fixed seed set.

Algorithms
Algorithms are categorized based on edge-level, node-level and other types of feedback. Edge-level feedback allows observing the status of each network connection. Node-level allows observing only which nodes were activated. Other feedback is more limited. Representative algorithms like CUCB, CTS, IMLinUCB, IMFB, etc. are discussed along with their regret bounds.

Innovations
The paper covers innovative modeling approaches using advanced bandits, Thompson Sampling, and Gaussian Processes. It also discusses context-aware, budget-aware, competitive, and temporally-decaying cascade extensions of the online IM problem.

Future Directions
Future directions involve developing more practical feedback models, generalized algorithms for diverse diffusion models, enhancements to the CMAB theory, and tackling IM problem variants like location-aware, community-aware, and multi-feature IM in an online setting.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper on online influence maximization:

1) The paper discusses modeling the online influence maximization problem using a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit framework. What are the main advantages and limitations of using this framework? How does it capture the exploration-exploitation tradeoff inherent in online learning problems?

2) The CUCB algorithm is proposed for edge-level feedback models. Explain how confidence bounds are constructed for each edge and used to guide seed node selection over time. What theoretical guarantees does this algorithm provide on cumulative regret? 

3) For node-level feedback models, the key challenge is the credit assignment problem when multiple parent nodes activate a node. Discuss the maximum likelihood and frequentist approaches proposed to address this issue. What are their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

4) Explain the linear generalization concept introduced for edge probabilities to simplify the learning task. How is this integrated into the IMLinUCB algorithm? What changes in the regret bounds compared to the non-parameterized CUCB algorithm?

5) The CTS algorithm incorporates Thompson Sampling into the CMAB-T framework for online influence maximization. Explain how posterior sampling of edge probabilities is used to guide super arm selection. How does the regret scale compare to UCB-based methods?

6) What is the key motivation behind using Gaussian Processes instead of linear models to estimate edge probabilities? Explain how the kernel function allows capturing complex edge probability patterns while still providing theoretical guarantees.  

7) For contextual models, discuss how time-varying features are incorporated to modulate edge probabilities over rounds. What relevance does this have for real-world dynamic networks? Explain the HÃ¶lder condition.

8) Explain the concept of triggering probability equivalence analysis introduced for competitive influence maximization problems. Why does the monotonicity typically used in analysis no longer hold here?

9) The survey discusses delayed and local feedback models for online influence maximization. What unique challenges do these limited feedback scenarios introduce? What kinds of algorithms are proposed and what theoretical results established?

10) What open questions and research gaps still exist in developing more generalized frameworks for online influence maximization? Discuss some ideas around integrating reinforcement learning methods or data-driven diffusion modeling.
