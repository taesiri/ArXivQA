# [BAM-DETR: Boundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer for Temporal   Sentence Grounding in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00083)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing query-based models for temporal sentence grounding typically represent a moment using its center and length. However, the center of a ground-truth moment can be ambiguous, leading to inaccurate predictions if the model fails to precisely locate the center. This reliance on precise center prediction is a key limitation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a boundary-oriented moment formulation, where each moment is represented by a triplet - an anchor point and its distances to the start and end boundaries. This removes the reliance on predicting the precise center, as the model now only needs to predict an anchor point within the target interval to estimate the boundaries directly. 

Based on this idea, the paper designs a Boundary-Aligned Moment Detection Transformer (BAM-DETR) with a dual-pathway decoder. One pathway refines the anchor point using global context, while the other focuses on the local context near boundaries to refine them. This separate design enables precise localization. 

The paper also proposes a quality-based scoring method to rank proposals based on their localization quality rather than their matching scores, ensuring high-quality proposals are prioritized.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a boundary-oriented moment formulation to replace the conventional center and length representation
- Design of a dual-pathway decoder in BAM-DETR to separately refine anchor and boundaries 
- Proposal of a quality-based scoring method to rank moment proposals
- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks, especially under strict metrics
- Demonstration of the robustness of BAM-DETR against biases in moment center locations and lengths

The proposed techniques effectively address limitations of existing methods and lead to improved localization accuracy. The boundary-oriented formulation and dual-pathway decoder design are the major innovations presented.
