# [Toward Cross-Layer Energy Optimizations in Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The energy consumption of machine learning (ML) workloads is enormous and continuing to grow rapidly, posing challenges related to costs, power delivery, and environmental sustainability. Despite extensive research on energy-efficient hardware, there are opportunities for software-based techniques to provide additional energy optimizations in a hardware-agnostic manner. This is especially important for large language models (LLMs) whose model sizes and computational demands are outpacing hardware efficiency gains.

Solutions:
The paper highlights two recent works that demonstrate the potential of software-based energy optimization techniques:

1) Zeus: Shows that lowering the GPU power limit induces a time-energy tradeoff (Pareto frontier) that can be exploited to minimize energy for ML training and inference while meeting job deadlines or service level objectives (SLOs). This technique is robust across GPU models and works for multi-GPU setups. 

2) Perseus: Identifies and removes "energy bloat" in large model training by observing and planning for load imbalances between pipeline stages (intrinsic bloat) and differences in progress rate across data parallel workers (extrinsic bloat). It reduces energy by up to 30% with minimal impact on training throughput.

The paper also notes that optimizing hyperparameters like batch size over recurrent job runs can further reduce energy-to-accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Makes the case for cross-layer energy optimization in ML systems, with co-design between hardware support and software techniques.
- Shows through Zeus and Perseus that significant energy savings are possible via software even on existing hardware.
- Hardware should provide better visibility (metrics) and control (knobs) to enable advanced software optimizations.
- Software should abstract away hardware details and focus on application characteristics, maintaining generality across accelerators.
- Concept of a narrow interface based on time-energy Pareto frontier that can guide joint hardware-software optimization.

In summary, the paper advocates for a symbiotic approach leveraging insights from both the hardware and software layers to realize the full potential of energy-efficient ML systems.
