# [Fairness-Aware Structured Pruning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15398)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Fairness-Aware Structured Pruning in Transformers":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are gaining widespread adoption but also raise concerns about fairness and bias towards certain groups. 
- Existing methods to prune LLMs to reduce their size focus solely on maintaining performance, not fairness.
- There is a need for pruning techniques that improve fairness without significant drops in language modeling performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel structured pruning method called Fairness-Aware Structured Pruning (FASP) that considers both performance and fairness when deciding which attention heads to prune.
- FASP computes separate scores to quantify each head's contribution to bias and performance. 
- Heads most critical for performance are preserved. Among the remaining heads, those contributing most negatively to fairness are prioritized for pruning first.

Main Contributions:
- Investigates impact of pruning heads on bias and finds standard techniques don't improve fairness.
- Proposes FASP, which prunes heads most responsible for bias while ensuring minimal performance loss.
- Shows FASP reduces gender bias by 8-39% across models like GPT-2, GPT-Neo, GPT-J while preserving perplexity.
- Demonstrates pruning heads for gender bias also reduces nationality, race, and sexual orientation biases.
- Provides both quantitative and qualitative results to demonstrate improved fairness with comparable language modeling ability.

In summary, the paper introduces a pruning approach called FASP that significantly enhances fairness towards multiple groups by selectively removing attention heads most contributing to bias, while retaining performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel structured pruning method called FASP that removes attention heads in transformer-based language models to reduce gender bias while preserving performance in language modeling capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel structured pruning method called Fairness-aware Structured Pruning (FASP) that considers both fairness and performance when pruning attention heads from transformer-based language models. Specifically:

1) The paper investigates the impact of removing attention heads on both bias and language modeling capabilities in several pre-trained transformer models. 

2) It introduces a way to quantify the contribution of each attention head to the model's overall bias and performance.

3) Based on these quantifications, FASP prioritizes pruning heads that negatively impact fairness, while avoiding pruning heads that are important for maintaining language modeling performance. 

4) Experiments demonstrate that FASP reduces gender bias by up to 39.5% compared to the original models, while preserving language modeling capabilities on par or better than existing pruning techniques.

5) Analysis shows pruning heads based on their impact on gender bias also reduces other correlated social biases like race, nationality and sexual orientation biases.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing FASP - a novel pruning technique that trades off performance and multiple social biases to produce fairer yet performant language models.

The paper proposes a novel structured pruning method called "Fairness-Aware Structured Pruning" (FASP) that aims to reduce bias in transformer-based language models by selectively removing attention heads. It quantifies the impact of heads on both performance (perplexity) and fairness (bias based on toxicity assessment). FASP prioritizes pruning heads that contribute negatively to fairness while retaining heads critical for performance. Experiments show FASP reduces gender bias and also other correlated biases like race, nationality etc. in models like GPT-2, DistilGPT-2, GPT-Neo etc. while preserving language modeling capabilities. So the core focus is on bias reduction in language models through a performance-fairness aware head pruning approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel structured pruning method called FASP that considers both model performance and fairness when deciding which attention heads to prune. How exactly does FASP quantify the contribution of each attention head to model bias and performance? What equations are used?

2. The paper finds that around 30% of the heads across most models play a crucial role in language modeling. Why do you think such a consistent pattern emerges regarding the percentage of important heads? What might be some factors that determine the number of essential heads? 

3. When comparing FASP to other pruning methods, the performance-only baseline unsurprisingly achieves the best perplexity but does not reduce bias. However, the fairness-only baseline reduces bias the most but suffers a huge perplexity increase. Why does this extreme trade-off between fairness and performance happen with these two methods?

4. The paper shows certain attention heads impact multiple social biases simultaneously. What underlying mechanisms might explain this phenomenon? Why might pruning these heads lead to fairness improvements across several biases as shown?

5. When reducing gender bias using FASP, the authors find corresponding decreases in other biases like nationality and race but a slight increase in religion bias for DistilGPT-2. What factors might determine whether mitigating one bias also reduces/increases another bias after pruning heads?

6. The qualitative examples showcase FASP's ability to generate less toxic outputs consistently across subgroups compared to other methods. What metrics or analyses beyond toxicity could further showcase and quantify this consistency in fairness from FASP?

7. How exactly does FASP balance the trade-off between model performance and fairness when deciding the pruning order of heads? Could any enhancements be made to the method used for balancing performance and fairness?

8. The paper relies on an existing toxicity detection model to quantify bias. What steps could be taken to account for any biases or inaccuracies in the toxicity detection model itself to get a more reliable measure of bias?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on structured pruning of attention heads. Do you think FASP's idea of considering both performance and fairness could be extended to unstructured pruning techniques that remove model weights? Why or why not?

10. The authors acknowledge that FASP could also be manipulated to intentionally amplify biases by targeting heads that alleviate biases. What measures could be incorporated into FASP to safeguard against such intentional misuse?
