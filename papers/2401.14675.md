# [Multi-model learning by sequential reading of untrimmed videos for   action recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing action recognition models take short trimmed video clips as input, which requires preprocessing of long untrimmed videos. This preprocessing is inefficient.
- Sequentially extracting clips from untrimmed videos makes clips highly correlated, which hinders training efficiency.

Proposed Solution: 
- Extract clips sequentially from beginning of untrimmed videos to avoid random access.
- Use multiple model replicas and feed them clips in turns to decorrelate clips for each model.  
- Synchronize model parameters using federated learning (FedProx algorithm) to consolidate learning.
- Gradually increase synchronization momentum over epochs so models learn features separately initially.

Contributions:
- Proposes end-to-end learning directly from untrimmed video instead of using precomputed clip features.
- Introduces federated learning for multiple models to reduce correlation of successive clips input to each model.
- Shows performance improvement over single model baseline, especially when using 2-3 synchronized models.
- Demonstrates efficiency gains in terms of computation time compared to random clip sampling.

In summary, the key ideas are to extract clips sequentially from untrimmed video and use multiple synchronized models to enable efficient end-to-end learning for action recognition instead of relying on precomputed clip features. The federated learning of models is shown to improve accuracy and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to train multiple action recognition models in parallel on video clips sequentially extracted from untrimmed videos, while synchronizing the model parameters using federated learning to reduce the correlation between successive clips.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new method for learning from untrimmed videos by:

1) Sequentially extracting video clips from untrimmed videos instead of random sampling of clips. This avoids inefficient random access and seeking within long untrimmed videos.

2) Using multiple models and feeding the sequentially extracted clips to the models in turns. This reduces the high correlation between successive clips that a single model sees. 

3) Synchronizing the multiple models via federated learning (specifically a variant called FedProx) to aggregate the models while allowing them to maintain some individuality.

In essence, the key ideas are to leverage multiple models to reduce clip correlation and use federated learning to synchronize them, while extracting clips sequentially from untrimmed videos for efficient end-to-end learning. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate improvements over baseline approaches.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

- action recognition
- untrimmed video
- online learning
- federated learning
- sequential clip sampling
- model synchronization

The paper proposes a new method for learning videos by aggregating multiple models through sequentially extracting and feeding video clips from untrimmed videos to the models. It then synchronizes the models using federated learning techniques. The key ideas involve handling untrimmed videos directly for action recognition without needing to precompute clip features, reducing correlation between successive clips by feeding them to multiple models, and synchronizing the models to improve performance. So the core keywords cover these main concepts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that training samples from sequentially extracted clips are highly correlated. How does the proposed method of using multiple models and federated learning help mitigate this issue of high correlation? What is the intuition behind why this approach works?

2. The paper experiments with different values of the synchronization momentum α in the FedProx update rule (Equation 8). Why does a value of α between 0.2-0.4 give better performance compared to α = 0 or α = 1? What does this indicate about the level of parameter synchronization that is optimal? 

3. Why does the performance increase when using 3 models in the sequential sampling case but decrease when using 4 models? What could be the reason that having more models eventually has a negative effect? 

4. For the MPII dataset, the paper creates its own train-validation split. What is the issue with using the official train-test split for sequential sampling in their experiments? Why does their proposed split resolve this issue?

5. The computation time measurements in Table 3 seem to indicate that sequential sampling is more efficient than random sampling. But the paper mentions further investigation is needed. What factors could affect the data loading time comparisons between sequential and random sampling?

6. How suitable is the UCF101 dataset for evaluating the method despite having trimmed videos? What properties of the videos in UCF101 make it usable for sequential sampling in the experiments?

7. The paper extracts 16 frames at stride 1 from untrimmed videos to create clips. How could different frame rates or strides impact the performance of the proposed approach? Would a higher stride be better or worse?

8. For inference, the paper averages the parameters of the M models into a single model. What other strategies could be used at inference time when having multiple synchronized models available?

9. The method assumes all frames in a clip have the same label. How does it handle transitions between activities where a clip contains multiple labels? Does discarding those clips create any problems?

10. The paper mentions further optimizing data loading and synchronization for more models. What specific optimization strategies could help improve scalability when increasing the number of models?
