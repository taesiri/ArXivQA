# [FAQ-Gen: An automated system to generate domain-specific FAQs to aid   content comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Frequently asked questions (FAQs) are helpful content comprehension aids, but manually creating high-quality, domain-specific FAQs for documents is difficult and time-consuming.  
- Existing question answering systems have limitations when applied to FAQ generation, such as struggling with domain-specific contexts and producing non-human readable answers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an end-to-end automated FAQ generation system that takes a document as input and outputs ranked, domain-aware FAQs.
- The system has a modular architecture consisting of 6 main steps: 
    1. Text extraction and chunking 
    2. Domain identification
    3. Question generation 
    4. Answer keyword/phrase extraction
    5. Answer completion and elaboration
    6. FAQ compilation and ranking
- Custom datasets were created to train specialized models for domain-aware question generation, answer extraction and answer elaboration. 
- A ranking algorithm prioritizes most relevant questions for the given context.

Main Contributions:
- Identification of gaps in existing QA systems for FAQ generation
- Proposal of a complete, modular end-to-end architecture for automated FAQ generation
- Creation of custom datasets for training domain-aware models 
- Qualitative human evaluation showing generated FAQs are high-quality, domain-aware and cover documents comprehensively
- Analysis providing useful pointers for future research into FAQ generation systems

In summary, the paper presents an innovative, modular system to automatically generate readable, domain-specific FAQs from documents to aid content comprehension. Both the architecture and specialized models move beyond existing QA methods to create an end-to-end solution tailored for FAQ generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end system for automatically generating high-quality, domain-specific frequently asked questions and answers from input text documents using modular natural language processing models.

Future enhancements are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the paper justify the need for a modular approach in the FAQ generation system rather than using a single question-answering model? What are some of the key advantages outlined?

2. The paper mentions using transfer learning with T5 as the base model. Why was T5 chosen over other language models like BERT? What specific capabilities of T5 make it suitable for the tasks in the FAQ pipeline?  

3. The paper talks about creating custom datasets for training where publicly available datasets were lacking. Can you describe the process and tools used to create these domain-specific datasets? What columns and data were included?

4. Explain the two approaches mentioned for chunking the input text - semantic partitioning and structural partitioning. What are the relative merits and demerits outlined for both? Which one is finally used and why?

5. The domain identification step is claimed to be significant in generating nuanced, domain-specific questions. How exactly does knowing the domain aid the question generation process? Can you expand on this?

6. How does the ranking algorithm used in the final step work? What are the two scores it uses to calculate relevance? How do these capture semantic and structural significance effectively?

7. What are some of the overall inferences made from the qualitative human evaluation of results? Can you expand on the top 2 key findings summarized in the paper based on the scores? 

8. The modular pipeline makes it easy to identify underperforming components. How can this localization help as opposed to a single question-answering model? Can you illustrate with an example?

9. The paper states the approach can provide pointers for NLP practitioners to explore this task further. What are 3 specific examples of things that can be further enhanced or built upon?

10. How does leveraging multithreading for deployment lead to performance enhancements? Explain briefly outlining the concept of parallelism exploited.
