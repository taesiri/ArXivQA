# [Automatic Spatial Calibration of Near-Field MIMO Radar With Respect to   Optical Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10981)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Combining optical RGB-D sensors (e.g. depth cameras) with MIMO radar imaging is an emerging area of interest, but existing calibration methods between these sensors are limited to the radar's far field (meters away). Calibrating them in the near field (within decimeters) is challenging.

- Typical radar calibration targets like corner reflectors appear distorted in the near field. Most related calibration methods rely on detecting the brightest point target, but this assumption fails for near field radar imaging.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel automatic pipeline for spatially calibrating RGB-D sensors and MIMO radar in the near field. 

- A custom calibration target is designed, consisting of textured styrofoam spheres with small radar-reflective steel balls embedded inside. The spheres are arranged in a square with a 5th ball at the center.

- Target detection involves circle detection in RGB-D images vs. cluster detection in the radar point cloud. Constraints like color, size, and spatial arrangements are used to filter and localize targets.

- Calibration parameters are estimated by registering the localized target points between sensors using a least-squares fitting.

Contributions:
- Design of a calibration target that works for both optical and radar sensors in the near field

- An automatic pipeline for target detection and localization in both sensors, followed by spatial registration

- Demonstrated accuracy within millimeters over a range of target orientations and distances, using two different RGB-D sensor types

- Showed robustness to ambiguity in radar signals for target localization

- First automatic near-field calibration between RGB-D and MIMO radar sensors

In summary, the key innovation is a bespoke calibration target and pipeline that, for the first time, allows automatically calibrating optical depth sensors with MIMO radar imaging in the challenging near field region.
