# [Large Language Models and Video Games: A Preliminary Scoping Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
With the recent surge of interest and capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, there is an exponential growth of research on applying LLMs to video games across areas like game AI, content generation, narrative, etc. However, given the nascent stage and rapid pace of research in this area, there has not yet been an attempt to scope out and synthesize the work conducted so far. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors conducted a scoping review of research papers published between 2020-early 2024 on LLMs and video games. They searched Google Scholar to identify 76 relevant papers out of 2260 results. They analyzed and categorized these papers into four key themes - Game AI and Agents, Game Development and Play, Narrative/Story/Dialogue, and Game Research and Reviews. 

Key Contributions:
- Provide a preliminary scoping review and state of research snapshot on application of LLMs to video games 
- Identify and summarize key focus areas and findings of work so far across game AI, development, narrative and game research
- Highlight most common LLMs used - predominately GPT - and trends in publication timeline 
- Surface nine additional relevant papers that use game datasets for LLM recommendation research
- Lay groundwork of understanding key directions and open challenges to inform and catalyze future research on LLMs and games

In summary, this paper reviews research conducted between 2020-early 2024 on using large language models for video games, summarizing contributions across four themes of game AI, development, narrative and research. It provides a first snapshot to capture the state of this rapidly evolving research area and inform future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides a preliminary scoping review of 76 papers published between 2022-2024 on the application of large language models to video games, categorizing the work into themes of game AI, game development, narrative, game research, and recommendation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing a preliminary scoping review of research on large language models (LLMs) and video games published between 2022-2024. Specifically, the authors:

- Conducted a search to identify 76 relevant papers on LLMs and video games
- Categorized these papers into 4 key themes: Game AI and Agents, Game Development and Play, Narrative/Story/Dialogue, and Game Research and Reviews 
- Analyzed the papers within each theme, summarizing the focus and key findings
- Captured an additional 9 relevant papers on recommender systems that used game datasets
- Provided a snapshot of the current state of research on applying LLMs to games as of early 2024
- Identified key directions and results so far in using LLMs for games 
- Laid the groundwork and foundations for future research on this quickly evolving topic

In summary, the main contribution is providing an initial scoping review of the emerging research area of LLMs and video games based on papers published so far. The review aimed to capture the current state of this new field and set the stage for ongoing and future work.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes a scoping review methodology to survey the literature on large language models (LLMs) and video games. What are the benefits and limitations of using a scoping review compared to other types of literature reviews for this topic?

2. The paper searches Google Scholar between 2020-2023. What implications might the choice of search engine and date range have on the papers identified? How might the findings differ if an alternate search strategy was used? 

3. The authors identify four key themes in the literature - Game AI and Agents, Game Development and Play, Narrative, Story and Dialogue, and Game Research and Reviews. Are there any other potential themes that could have emerged from the literature? Why might certain topics have been clustered into these themes over alternatives?

4. Within the theme of Game AI and Agents, what are some of the limitations of current LLM capabilities for game agents identified in the surveyed papers? What future work is needed to address these limitations? 

5. For the papers focused on game content generation, what key tensions around data versus level creation are identified? How might these tensions be resolved in future work?

6. Several papers report on the use of LLMs to support educators in developing serious games. What are some of the main benefits identified from using LLMs for this purpose? What challenges remain?  

7. What differences are observed in the surveyed papers between player experiences with AI-Native games versus traditional games? What design implications does this have for the development of AI-Native games?

8. What are some of the main limitations identified with using LLMs for automated game review analysis? How might these limitations be addressed in future work?

9. The authors identify 9 additional papers using game datasets for LLM recommendation research. What new research directions does this open up at the intersection of games and LLMs? 

10. What are the main challenges identified with trying to capture the state of research on games and LLMs over time? How might the authors address this in future work?
