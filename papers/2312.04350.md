# [CLadder: A Benchmark to Assess Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04350)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new NLP dataset called CLadder for evaluating the causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The motivation is that while causal reasoning is considered a hallmark of intelligence, most existing work focuses on testing LLMs' commonsense causal knowledge rather than their ability to perform formal causal reasoning following established rules. To address this gap, the authors compose a dataset of over 10,000 natural language questions grounded in symbolic causal queries, graphs, and ground truth answers derived through a causal inference engine. The questions span all three rungs of the Ladder of Causation (associational, interventional, counterfactual) across diverse graphs and stories. The authors also propose a prompting strategy called CausalCoT that decomposes causal questions into subquestions to guide LLM reasoning. Experiments on multiple LLMs show the dataset is highly challenging, with the best accuracy around 60-66\%. Detailed error analysis reveals limitations of current LLMs in key aspects of formal causal reasoning like query formalization and identification of estimands. The paper contributes a principled approach for evaluating and improving the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs through algorithmically generated questions grounded in formal causal inference methodology.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new NLP dataset and task called CLadder to systematically evaluate the causal reasoning capabilities of large language models, by generating a diverse set of causal questions grounded in formal graphical models, along with a prompting strategy called CausalCoT to elicit step-by-step causal reasoning from the models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a new NLP task, causal inference in natural language, to assess the causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This is done by grounding natural language questions in formal causal models and deriving ground truth answers through a causal inference engine.

2. It presents a large-scale dataset called CLadder with over 10,000 causal questions spanning different types of queries, causal graphs, and verbalization stories. The questions are algorithmically generated but checked for natural language properties like grammaticality and human readability.

3. It proposes a method called CausalCoT which uses a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to guide LLMs to solve causal questions by extracting the causal graph, query, available data, and providing step-by-step reasoning.

4. It conducts extensive experiments on multiple LLMs using the CLadder dataset and CausalCoT prompting, showing that causal inference is still very challenging for current LLMs. The analysis provides insights into the limitations of LLMs regarding formal causal reasoning.

In summary, the key innovation is in assessing and enhancing the causal reasoning skills of LLMs through the lens of formal causal inference, instead of just evaluating their commonsense causal knowledge. The introduced dataset and prompting method aim to facilitate research towards improving LLMs' abilities for principled causal reasoning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called CLadder for testing causal reasoning abilities of language models. What are some key aspects of the dataset generation process that make it well-suited for this purpose? For example, the coverage of different rungs of the Ladder of Causation, the use of both commonsensical and nonsensical stories, etc.

2. The paper proposes a model called CausalCoT that uses a chain-of-thought prompting strategy to elicit formal causal reasoning from language models. How is this strategy inspired by the idea of a causal inference engine? What are the different reasoning steps involved? 

3. One motivation of the paper is to assess whether language models perform amortized causal inference just by repeating patterns or whether they engage in formal causal reasoning. What evidence from the experiments on CLadder and analysis using CausalCoT sheds light on this question?

4. Error analysis of model performance on CLadder suggests that extracting the causal graph (Step 1) works well but applying causal inference methods (Steps 2 and 3) remains challenging. Why might this be the case? What capabilities are still lacking in current LLMs?

5. The paper introduces anti-commonsensical and nonsensical stories during dataset generation to avoid test set contamination issues. How effective is this? What drop in performance do models show on these parts of the dataset?

6. CausalCoT seems to significantly boost model performance over vanilla prompting. But what are some limitations of this strategy? For instance, does it improve performance evenly across different rungs or query types?

7. The paper performs an ablation study by removing different steps of CausalCoT. Which steps seem most crucial for its strong performance? What does this imply about the key challenges in causal reasoning?

8. One analysis studies the effect of in-context learning by providing an example solution before the question. Which query types benefit the most from this? Why might this be the case?

9. The ROSCOE analysis provides fine-grained scores about coherence, faithfulness, reasoning alignment etc. Which aspects show strength and which show weakness? What might be the reasons?

10. The conclusion discusses a causal inference engine "plug-in" for language models. What challenges do you foresee in building and interfacing with such modules? How might the language understanding difficulties be addressed?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper argues that the ability to perform causal reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence. However, it is unclear whether large language models (LLMs) used in AI today actually have a deep understanding of causality beyond surface pattern recognition. Much prior work has focused on testing LLMs' knowledge about commonsense causal relationships, but not their ability to perform principled causal reasoning by applying rules such as do-calculus and counterfactual inference.

Proposed Solution: 
To address this gap, the authors propose a new benchmark dataset called CLadder with over 10,000 causal questions spanning different query types and causal graphs. The questions are algorithmically generated by first specifying a causal graph, query type, and ground truth answers derived from a causal inference engine. These are then verbalized into natural language stories. The authors also propose CausalCoT, a prompting strategy to guide LLM reasoning through the steps of extracting the graph, identifying the query type, finding the estimand, parsing available data, and finally solving the query.

Main Contributions:

1) Formalizes causal reasoning in LLM evaluation, going beyond testing commonsense causal knowledge

2) Introduces algorithmically generated CLadder benchmark with 10K+ questions covering different rungs of the Ladder of Causation 

3) Develops CausalCoT prompting strategy inspired by causal inference principles to elicit step-by-step reasoning in LLMs

4) Conducts extensive experiments showing CLadder is challenging for LLMs and CausalCoT leads to improved performance, while analysis of errors reveals limitations of current LLMs' causal reasoning abilities

Overall, the paper makes an important contribution towards rigorously evaluating and improving the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs through principled techniques grounded in causal inference theory. The proposed benchmark and analysis offer valuable insights into current progress and challenges in developing AI systems with deeper understanding of causality.
