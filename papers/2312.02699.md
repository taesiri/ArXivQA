# [Enhancing Vehicle Entrance and Parking Management: Deep Learning   Solutions for Efficiency and Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02699)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an integrated system leveraging deep learning techniques to automate vehicle entrance, identification, driver verification, record-keeping, and parking management within organizations. Manual methods for these tasks are inefficient and time-consuming. The system employs state-of-the-art YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and license plate recognition, verified against a database to authenticate vehicles. For enhanced security, a driver verification subsystem performs face detection via Haar Cascades and recognition using DeepFace against an employee database. The system ensures both vehicle and driver are registered. Additionally, a mobile application utilizes image processing to identify vacant parking spaces. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate YOLOv8 achieves over 99% accuracy in both vehicle and license plate detection tasks. By automating these cumbersome manual processes, the system significantly enhances convenience, security and efficiency for vehicle entrance and parking in organizational buildings. The integration of advanced deep learning models, database verification and mobile technology provides a comprehensive solution to this complex challenge.
