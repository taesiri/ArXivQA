# [Extracting Lexical Features from Dialects via Interpretable Dialect   Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17914)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying linguistic differences between dialects of a language often requires expert knowledge and meticulous human analysis, due to the complexity and nuance involved. This process is also time-consuming and language-specific.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents a novel approach to automatically extract distinguishing lexical features of dialects by utilizing interpretable dialect classifiers. 
- The key idea is that neural dialect classifiers learn certain distinguishing features during training that enable accurate predictions. By interpreting these models using feature attribution methods, one can extract these salient lexical features.

Methods:
- They train neural classifiers to predict dialects and pair them with post-hoc (Leave-One-Out) and intrinsic (SelfExplain) interpretability techniques to get feature attributions. 
- They introduce a corpus-level feature extraction method using TF-IDF on classifier explanations to get global dialect features.

Experiments:
- Experiments conducted on 3 language groups: Mandarin, Italian dialects, Low Saxon dialects.
- Evaluate explanation quality using sufficiency and plausibility.
- Automatically evaluate capability of capturing known language-specific features.
- Human evaluation of extracted features by annotators.

Results:
- Explanations shown to be sufficient and plausible.
- Automatic evaluation confirms known lexical features are captured with high precision. 
- Human evaluation shows method extracts ~90% dialect-specific features for Mandarin, ~50% for more challenging Italian dialects.

Contributions:
- Novel interpretable learning approach to extract lexical features distinguishing dialects.
- Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates efficacy across diverse languages.
- Could assist linguists/researchers analyze dialectal variations without expertise.

The paper makes significant progress towards automatically extracting distinguishing lexical features of dialects by interpreting neural classifiers. The methods and analysis open up new possibilities for understanding dialectal variations.
