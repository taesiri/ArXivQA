# [Neural Preset for Color Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new method for color style transfer called Neural Preset. The main goal is to address three key limitations of existing color style transfer methods:

1. They produce unrealistic artifacts like distorted textures or inharmonious colors. 

2. They cannot handle high-resolution images due to large memory requirements.

3. They are inefficient for switching between different styles.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes two main ideas:

1. Using Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) to map pixels consistently and avoid artifacts, while only requiring a small memory footprint. 

2. A two-stage pipeline that first normalizes the input image color and then stylizes it. This allows storing color styles as presets for efficient style switching.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed DNCM technique and two-stage pipeline can enable high-quality, high-resolution, and efficient color style transfer compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to validate whether Neural Preset successfully overcomes the key limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the Neural Preset technique for color style transfer. Specifically, the paper proposes two key components:

1) Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM): DNCM avoids visual artifacts by consistently mapping pixels of the same color value to a specific output color. It operates on each pixel independently with a small memory footprint, enabling handling high-resolution images. DNCM can model arbitrary color mappings using only a few hundred learnable parameters.

2) Two-stage pipeline: The paper divides color style transfer into two stages - color normalization and stylization. This allows extracting color styles as presets for fast style switching by reusing them to stylize normalized images. It also enables distributed deployment friendly for on-device applications.

In addition, the paper presents a self-supervised training strategy to learn the Neural Preset model without paired training data. 

Through comprehensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that Neural Preset outperforms previous state-of-the-art color style transfer methods in various aspects, including visual quality, memory consumption, inference speed, and model size. The trained model can also be applied to other color mapping tasks like image enhancement without fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Neural Preset technique to address limitations of prior color style transfer methods and enable new applications. The core ideas include using DNCM for artifact-free and efficient color mapping and adopting a two-stage pipeline for fast style switching and on-device deployment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

This CVPR 2023 paper introduces a two-stage Neural Preset technique for color style transfer that avoids artifacts and enables fast style switching by normalizing the input image color, extracting the style image color parameters as a preset, and reusing presets to stylize normalized inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new technique called Neural Preset for color style transfer. Here are my thoughts on how it compares to other research in this field:

Strengths of the Neural Preset technique:

- Produces more photorealistic stylized images without artifacts compared to prior methods like PhotoWCT, WCT2, PhotoNAS, etc. The key ideas are using deterministic neural color mapping (DNCM) to map pixels consistently and splitting the process into color normalization and stylization stages.

- Allows fast switching between color styles by storing style parameters as presets that can be reused. This is much more efficient than prior single-stage models.

- Supports very high resolution images like 8K with a small memory footprint due to DNCM operating independently on pixels. State-of-the-art methods run into out-of-memory issues.

- Achieves real-time performance for 4K images, about 28x speedup over PhotoWCT2 based on benchmarks.

- Can generalize to other color mapping tasks like enhancement and harmonization without fine-tuning.

Limitations compared to other techniques:

- JPEG artifacts may be amplified in some cases. Other methods may handle this better with built-in regularization.

- Cannot map the same color to different values in different image regions, unlike some local adaptive methods. 

- Requires a self-supervised training strategy rather than supervised learning since paired training data is unavailable. Performance may be lower than supervised models on some metrics.

Overall, I think this Neural Preset technique is a significant advance over prior work in photorealistic color style transfer. The ideas of DNCM and the two-stage pipeline offer clear advantages in terms of quality, efficiency, and flexibility. The self-supervised training strategy is reasonable given the lack of paired ground truth data. Some limitations remain compared to techniques designed for specific conditions, but the results seem highly promising.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion:

1. Addressing limitations of the current method, such as preventing the amplification of JPEG artifacts, handling color styles with very different inherent colors, and performing local-adaptive color mapping. For example, developing auxiliary regularization to reduce JPEG artifacts or incorporating appropriate user interactions for complex color mapping cases.

2. Exploring more applications of the method, such as using it for other image processing tasks like image matting. 

3. Training the model with more diverse data, such as paintings and illustrations, to improve its generalization ability.

4. Deploying the model on mobile devices to enable real-time stylization and support interactive editing.

5. Extending the method to video color stylization by enforcing temporal consistency.

6. Developing unsupervised or weakly-supervised training strategies to reduce the need for paired training data.

7. Combining the proposed deterministic neural color mapping with generative models like GANs to generate more realistic stylized results.

8. Exploring the proposed self-supervised training strategy for other vision tasks beyond color style transfer.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the method itself, applying it to more tasks, training it with more data, deploying it efficiently, and developing new learning strategies. The core ideas of deterministic neural color mapping and the two-stage pipeline also have potential for further exploration.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a technique called Neural Preset for color style transfer. The method has two main components - Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) and a two-stage pipeline. DNCM operates on each pixel independently to map colors, avoiding artifacts and enabling high-resolution processing. The two-stage pipeline first normalizes the input image color and then stylizes it. This allows efficient style switching by extracting color styles into presets and reusing them. Since there are no pairwise training datasets, a self-supervised strategy is proposed where input images are perturbed to create pseudo-training pairs. Experiments demonstrate Neural Preset avoids artifacts, handles high resolutions, enables real-time performance, and naturally supports other color mapping applications like enhancement. Compared to prior neural methods, Neural Preset is up to 28x faster while using far less memory. The user study also shows it produces preferred qualitative results. In summary, Neural Preset advances the state-of-the-art in photorealistic neural color style transfer.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents a Neural Preset technique for photorealistic color style transfer. The method has two core designs to overcome limitations of prior work: (1) It uses Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) to map pixels consistently and avoid artifacts. DNCM operates on each pixel independently to allow handling high-resolution images. (2) It employs a two-stage pipeline, first normalizing the input image color, then stylizing it using parameters extracted from the style image. This enables fast style switching by reusing extracted parameters.  

Since no paired training data is available, a self-supervised strategy is proposed. The input image is perturbed to create two samples, which are normalized to be consistent, then stylized by swapping the style parameters. Losses encourage normalized consistency and reconstruction to the original. Experiments demonstrate advantages over state-of-the-art in quality, speed, memory efficiency, and scalability to high resolutions. The model generalizes well to other tasks like enhancement and harmonization without fine-tuning. Limitations include amplifying JPEG artifacts and inability to locally adapt colors. Overall, the Neural Preset technique provides an effective photorealistic style transfer method with practical benefits.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a Neural Preset technique for color style transfer. The main method has two key components:

1. Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM): DNCM converts pixels of the same color to a specific color via an image-adaptive color mapping matrix predicted by an encoder network. This avoids artifacts and enables handling high-resolution images with small memory footprint. 

2. Two-stage pipeline: The first stage builds a nDNCM to normalize the input image color. The second stage transfers the normalized image to the target color style using a sDNCM with parameters extracted from the style image. This allows fast style switching by reusing extracted color styles on new inputs.

The pipeline is trained via a self-supervised strategy. Since no ground truth stylized images are available, the input image is randomly perturbed to two versions with different colors. A consistency loss encourages the first stage to output consistent representations for the two versions. A reconstruction loss trains the second stage to stylize them back to the original versions. Experiments demonstrate this method produces high-quality stylization without artifacts, handles high-resolution inputs, enables real-time performance, and naturally supports style transfer applications.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing limitations of existing color style transfer methods, including visual artifacts, vast memory requirement, and slow style switching speed. The key problems or questions it aims to solve are:

1. How to avoid visual artifacts like distorted textures or inharmonious colors in the stylized image? Existing convolutional neural network based methods may produce inconsistent outputs for pixels with the same value, leading to artifacts. 

2. How to handle high-resolution images like 8K with a small memory footprint? Current models have huge runtime memory requirements and often run into out-of-memory issues even at 4K resolution.

3. How to enable fast switching of color styles? Existing methods carry out color style transfer in a single stage, requiring running the whole model each time. This is inefficient when applying diverse styles to one image or transferring one style to many images.

4. How to train an effective color style transfer model in the absence of paired training data? Since there are no input-output image pairs, most methods rely on weak constraints like perceptual losses that result in artifacts.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes two core techniques:

1) Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) that avoids artifacts by operating on each pixel independently. It also enables handling high-resolution images with small memory footprint. 

2) A two-stage pipeline with color normalization and stylization. It allows fast style switching by extracting style parameters as presets and reusing them on normalized inputs.

The paper also describes a self-supervised training strategy to learn the model without paired data.
