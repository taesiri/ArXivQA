# [Neural Preset for Color Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new method for color style transfer called Neural Preset. The main goal is to address three key limitations of existing color style transfer methods:

1. They produce unrealistic artifacts like distorted textures or inharmonious colors. 

2. They cannot handle high-resolution images due to large memory requirements.

3. They are inefficient for switching between different styles.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes two main ideas:

1. Using Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) to map pixels consistently and avoid artifacts, while only requiring a small memory footprint. 

2. A two-stage pipeline that first normalizes the input image color and then stylizes it. This allows storing color styles as presets for efficient style switching.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed DNCM technique and two-stage pipeline can enable high-quality, high-resolution, and efficient color style transfer compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to validate whether Neural Preset successfully overcomes the key limitations.
