# [Neural Preset for Color Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13511)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new method for color style transfer called Neural Preset. The main goal is to address three key limitations of existing color style transfer methods:

1. They produce unrealistic artifacts like distorted textures or inharmonious colors. 

2. They cannot handle high-resolution images due to large memory requirements.

3. They are inefficient for switching between different styles.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes two main ideas:

1. Using Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM) to map pixels consistently and avoid artifacts, while only requiring a small memory footprint. 

2. A two-stage pipeline that first normalizes the input image color and then stylizes it. This allows storing color styles as presets for efficient style switching.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed DNCM technique and two-stage pipeline can enable high-quality, high-resolution, and efficient color style transfer compared to existing methods. The experiments aim to validate whether Neural Preset successfully overcomes the key limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the Neural Preset technique for color style transfer. Specifically, the paper proposes two key components:

1) Deterministic Neural Color Mapping (DNCM): DNCM avoids visual artifacts by consistently mapping pixels of the same color value to a specific output color. It operates on each pixel independently with a small memory footprint, enabling handling high-resolution images. DNCM can model arbitrary color mappings using only a few hundred learnable parameters.

2) Two-stage pipeline: The paper divides color style transfer into two stages - color normalization and stylization. This allows extracting color styles as presets for fast style switching by reusing them to stylize normalized images. It also enables distributed deployment friendly for on-device applications.

In addition, the paper presents a self-supervised training strategy to learn the Neural Preset model without paired training data. 

Through comprehensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that Neural Preset outperforms previous state-of-the-art color style transfer methods in various aspects, including visual quality, memory consumption, inference speed, and model size. The trained model can also be applied to other color mapping tasks like image enhancement without fine-tuning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Neural Preset technique to address limitations of prior color style transfer methods and enable new applications. The core ideas include using DNCM for artifact-free and efficient color mapping and adopting a two-stage pipeline for fast style switching and on-device deployment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

This CVPR 2023 paper introduces a two-stage Neural Preset technique for color style transfer that avoids artifacts and enables fast style switching by normalizing the input image color, extracting the style image color parameters as a preset, and reusing presets to stylize normalized inputs.
