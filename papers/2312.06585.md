# [Beyond Human Data: Scaling Self-Training for Problem-Solving with   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06585)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from this paper:

This paper explores a simple yet powerful self-training method called Reinforced Self-Training with Expectation Maximization (ReST-EM) to improve large language models (LLMs) without reliance on scarce human-labeled data. ReST-EM alternates between a generate step where the LLM creates training data and filters it via a reward signal, and an improve step where the LLM fine-tunes on this synthetic data. Theoretically, ReST-EM is grounded in applying expectation-maximization for reinforcement learning. Empirically, the authors show ReST-EM leads to substantial gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks using PaLM models, significantly exceeding fine-tuning on human-generated data. Multiple iterations of ReST-EM provide further improvements, though performance eventually saturates then declines due to overfitting. ReST-EM benefits from more model capacity and training data, produces gains in pass@k metrics, exhibits positive transfer, and requires little computation relative to pretraining costs. Limitations include the need for some human-labeled data and reward design. Overall, the simplicity, scalability and effectiveness of ReST-EM underscores the promise of self-training with feedback for reducing reliance on human annotations.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on human-generated data is common, but performance is often limited by quantity and diversity of high-quality human data. 
- Acquiring sufficient human data is challenging for complex problem-solving tasks like mathematical reasoning and code generation.

Proposed Solution: 
- Investigate a self-training method called ReSTEM that uses model-generated synthetic data instead of human data.
- ReSTEM alternates between a Generate step (sample solutions from the LLM) and Improve step (fine-tune LLM on filtered samples) 
- Show that ReSTEM is an instance of expectation-maximization (EM) for reinforcement learning.

Experiments:
- Test ReSTEM on PaLM models of varying sizes on MATH (mathematical reasoning) and APPS (code generation) benchmarks.
- Compare to supervised fine-tuning on human-generated data.
- Analyze impact on performance, overfitting, pass@k metrics, transfer learning.

Key Results:
- ReSTEM significantly improves performance over fine-tuning on human data alone, especially for larger PaLM models.  
- Performance gains continue to improve with more ReSTEM iterations on MATH but overfitting occurs on APPS.
- ReSTEM boosts pass@k performance and does not degrade performance on other benchmarks.
- Ablations show ReSTEM is data-efficient but benefits from more iterations and more data.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate self-training with feedback as a promising approach to reduce dependence on human data
- Show that model-generated data can substantially surpass human data for fine-tuning
- Highlight scalability of ReSTEM to large LLMs and efficacy on mathematical reasoning and code generation


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-training method called Reinforced Self-Training with Expectation-Maximization (\method) that iteratively generates samples from a language model, filters them using a reward signal, and fine-tunes the model on the filtered samples to significantly improve performance on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a simple yet effective self-training method called ReST^EM for improving language models, in particular on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. The key ideas are:

(1) Alternating between generating samples from the language model and filtering them based on a reward signal (E-step), and fine-tuning the model on the filtered samples (M-step). 

(2) Demonstrating that this iterative process, with just a few iterations, can significantly improve performance over just fine-tuning on human-generated data. For example, on mathematical reasoning, the ReST^EM fine-tuned PaLM-2-L model achieves 41.9% accuracy compared to 35.6% for the base model and 36.8% for fine-tuning on human data.

(3) Showing that the improvements transfer to related tasks and do not degrade performance on a broad suite of capabilities. 

(4) Providing ablation studies analyzing the impact of multiple iterations, dataset size, number of solutions per problem etc.

Overall, the paper makes a case for using model-generated data instead of just human-generated data, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability. The proposed ReST^EM method offers a simple template for language model self-improvement with just scalar feedback.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that the performance of language models trained on human-generated data is often limited by the quantity and diversity of such data. Could you expand more on the specific limitations of human-generated data for training language models? 

2. The paper proposes a self-training method called ReSTEM. Could you walk through the mathematical justification for how ReSTEM relates to the expectation-maximization algorithm for reinforcement learning? 

3. ReSTEM seems to work well for mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. What are some other domains or tasks where you think ReSTEM could be impactfully applied? What modifications might be needed to adapt ReSTEM to those domains?

4. The paper evaluates ReSTEM on PaLM and GPT models. Do you think ReSTEM would also be effective when applied to other model architectures like T5 or BLOOM? What differences might we expect?

5. The paper finds that multiple iterations of ReSTEM can sometimes lead to overfitting. What are some ways overfitting could be detected and addressed when using ReSTEM? 

6. How does the sample efficiency and computational efficiency of ReSTEM compare to other self-training methods like iterative maximum likelihood training? Where does ReSTEM have advantages or disadvantages?

7. The paper uses a binary reward signal to filter generated samples. Could ReSTEM be extended to non-binary or more granular reward signals? What methodology changes would that require?

8. What are some ways the E-step of ReSTEM could be improved, for example by using more advanced search or planning procedures? Do you have any specific ideas to propose? 

9. Could adversarial training be effectively incorporated into ReSTEM? If so, how should the adversary be designed and at what points should it provide adversarial examples?

10. The paper shows ReSTEM leading to improved reasoning capabilities. However, could the method also lead to models that "hack" the reward signal but do not truly improve in capability? How could this possibility be safeguarded against?
