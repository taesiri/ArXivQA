## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of methods and algorithms for personalized medicine, with a focus on optimal treatment regimes and sequential decision-making. Under a finite horizon, approaches like Q-learning and its variants as well as multi-armed bandit algorithms are effective in estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes from clinical trial data or designing adaptive trials. These methods balance exploration and exploitation to determine personalized treatment sequences over a predefined number of stages. The paper then discusses the extension to infinite horizon settings enabled by mobile health technologies, transforming the problem into a reinforcement learning task. Methods like Greedy Gradient Q-learning, V-learning and pT-learning can find optimal policies over an indefinite number of decision points. Throughout, the paper supplements methodological details with pertinent examples spanning oncology, diabetes management and beyond. Challenges are discussed including confounding, off-policy evaluation, violations of the Markov property and more. Overall, it provides a far-reaching overview of impactful techniques, implementations and open questions across timescales for the emerging frontier of personalized medicine.
