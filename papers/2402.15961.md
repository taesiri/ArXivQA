# [VOLoc: Visual Place Recognition by Querying Compressed Lidar Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- City-scale Lidar maps are increasingly available but need compression for efficient storage. This makes direct visual place recognition (VPR) in compressed Lidar maps challenging due to the increased modality gap and loss of details from compression.
- Existing VPR methods rely on image-to-image or Lidar-to-Lidar matching, but do not address image-to-compressed Lidar matching.

Proposed Solution (VOLoc):
- Exploit geometric similarity between images and Lidar for VPR without decompressing maps.
- Geometry-Preserving Compressor (GPC) compresses Lidar maps reversibly by clustering and downsampling to preserve structure.
- Geometric Recovery Module (GRM) uses visual odometry and point cloud optimization to reconstruct local structures from images as query point clouds. 
- Attention-based feature aggregation converts query clouds and compressed sub-maps into global descriptors for similarity search.
- Transfer learning is used to pretrain the feature aggregation module.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to enable direct image-to-compressed Lidar place recognition via geometric similarity.
- Geometry-Preserving Compressor and Geometric Recovery Module to reconstruct geometric structures from compressed Lidar and images.
- Attention-based feature aggregation with transfer learning to handle modality gap.
- Comprehensive experiments including 3 visual odometry systems, showing comparable accuracy to Lidar-to-Lidar methods.
- New visual-to-Lidar localization benchmark dataset constructed from KITTI.

In summary, VOLoc addresses the novel and practical problem of image-based place recognition in compressed Lidar maps, via an end-to-end framework exploiting geometric information to bridge the modality gap. Experiments validate its effectiveness over baselines.
