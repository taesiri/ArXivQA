# [Few-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer for Prompting Large Language Models in   Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks, but are typically trained on English data. This excludes speakers of low-resource languages from benefiting. 
- Common cross-lingual methods like training multilingual models from scratch face the "curse of multilinguality", where performance declines as more languages are added.
- It's unclear how to best adapt PLMs for few-shot prompting specifically in low-resource languages. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use LLaMa, a 7B parameter monolingual PLM, as the base model. Compare 3 methods to adapt it for prompting in low-resource African languages:
  1. Prompt: Directly prompt LLaMa in the target language
  2. Translate: Translate prompt to English, prompt LLaMa, translate output back
  3. LAFT: Further pre-train LLaMa on target language data, then prompt
- Evaluate on summarization, NER and topic classification tasks in Hausa, Kinyarwanda and Luganda.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic evaluation of methods to adapt a large monolingual PLM for few-shot prompting in low-resource languages.
- Surprisingly find that prompt and translate approaches beat LAFT overall, despite LAFT's higher compute cost. Prompting works best on average.
- Show task/language-dependent performance differences. LAFT occasionally optimal, but underperforms on following prompt format.
- Significant result that prompting outperforms other methods aggregated over all tasks/languages/shots.
- Release LAFT-adapted LLaMa models for 3 African languages.

In summary, the paper provides a rigorous assessment of techniques to enable few-shot prompting in low-resource languages using a monolingual PLM. Key finding is that simple prompting works most effectively on average.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates methods for adapting large monolingual language models to low-resource languages for few-shot prompting, finding that simple few-shot prompting outperforms translating prompts or language-adaptive pre-training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) It presents the first systematic evaluation of methods for adapting a large PLM to a low-resource language for prompting. Specifically, it investigates three methods: few-shot prompting, neural machine translation followed by few-shot prompting, and language-adaptive fine-tuning followed by few-shot prompting.

2) It evaluates these methods on three low-resource African languages (Kinyarwanda, Hausa, and Luganda) using three NLP tasks (named entity recognition, abstractive summarization, and multi-class topic classification).

3) The results show that few-shot prompting performs better on average across all tasks and languages compared to translating and language-adaptive fine-tuning. Statistical significance testing confirms that few-shot prompting is significantly better for all shot sizes when results are aggregated across tasks and languages.

4) The paper releases the LAFT models adapted for Kinyarwanda, Hausa, and Luganda via the HuggingFace model hub to enable further research.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic evaluation showing that few-shot prompting is an effective and compute-efficient method for adapting large monolingual PLMs to low-resource languages when compared to other adaptation approaches like machine translation and language-adaptive fine-tuning.

The paper investigates methods for adapting a primarily English pre-trained language model for few-shot prompting in low-resource African languages. It compares three approaches - prompting, translating to English then prompting, and language-adaptive fine-tuning - across summarization, NER, and classification tasks. The key findings relate to prompting outperforming the other methods on average, while also being efficient. Overall, the main topics cover prompting PLMs cross-lingually, especially for low-resource settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares three methods for adapting a large language model (LLaMa) trained primarily in English for prompting in low-resource languages. Could you explain in more detail the motivation behind evaluating these specific methods? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of each?

2. Language-adaptive fine-tuning (LAFT) carries the greatest computational cost of the three methods. Why might the authors hypothesize that LAFT could lead to the best performance despite the extra compute overhead? What might be some reasons it does not always outperform the other methods?  

3. The paper finds that few-shot prompting works best on average across tasks and languages. However, the results are language and task dependent. Can you discuss specific cases where LAFT or translation work better? What language or task characteristics might make one method generally more suitable?

4. The paper uses LLaMa rather than a multilingual model. What is the rationale behind using a predominantly monolingual model? What are the potential tradeoffs of this decision compared to leveraging existing multilingual PLMs?

5. How might the quality of the machine translation system impact performance of the translation method? If translation quality were higher, would you expect the relative performance of translation to increase? Why or why not?

6. For sequence labeling tasks like NER, what difficulties arise when trying to translate the labels? How does the paper handle translation of labels in the experiments? Could the translation of labels negatively impact performance?

7. The paper finds LAFT performs very well on summarization despite poorer results on other tasks. What explanation is provided for this result? Do you think this explanation fully accounts for the performance difference? How might you further analyze or confirm the cause?

8. The paper acknowledges limitations around lack of hyperparameter optimization for LAFT. If computational constraints were not an issue, how could hyperparameters be tuned and would you expect LAFT performance to improve?

9. The results show all methods underperform even a weak majority baseline on the KinNEWS topic classification task. Why might the methods struggle on this specific task? Would you expect similar issues generalizing to other classification datasets?

10. The paper focuses specifically on adapting models for prompting rather than overall cross-lingual performance. Do you think these methods could also improve broader cross-lingual abilities or are they mainly beneficial for few-shot settings? Why?
