# [TCE at Qur'an QA 2023 Shared Task: Low Resource Enhanced   Transformer-based Ensemble Approach for Qur'anic QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13060)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles two tasks from the Qur'an QA 2023 shared task:

Task A: Ad-hoc retrieval of relevant Qur'anic passages given a question in Modern Standard Arabic. This is challenging due to the language gap between questions (MSA) and passages (Classical Arabic).

Task B: Reading comprehension by extracting answer spans from retrieved Qur'anic passages for a given question. This is made difficult by the limited size and imbalanced distribution of the training data.

Proposed Solution:

- Employ transfer learning by fine-tuning multiple pre-trained Arabic language models (AraBERT, CAMeLBERT, AraELECTRA) on external datasets before applying them to the target tasks.

- Use both dual encoders and cross encoders for task A. Dual encoders separately encode questions and passages while cross encoders jointly encode question-passage pairs.

- For task B, compare two learning methods: First Answer Loss (FAL) and Multi Answer Loss (MAL). MAL optimizes for all ground truth answers while FAL focuses only on the first.

- Apply thresholding based on prediction confidence scores to identify unanswerable questions.

- Use voting ensembles of models trained with different random seeds to improve stability.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrate significant gains from transfer learning and model ensembles despite the limited size of the target dataset.

- Show that MAL outperforms FAL, especially for multi-answer samples, on a faithfully split validation set.

- Propose using hard negatives mining and threshold optimization to improve retrieval and handle unanswerable questions. 

- Release experiment code and trained models to support future research.

- Best models achieve MAP of 25.05% on task A and pAP of 57.11% on task B, greatly surpassing baseline performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents ensemble-based approaches using transfer learning and thresholding mechanisms with Arabic transformer language models to address low-resource Quranic question answering and passage retrieval tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors propose ensemble-based approaches utilizing transfer learning with external resources to address the low-resource challenges in the Qur'an QA tasks. This includes investigating different architectures like dual encoders and cross encoders for passage retrieval in Task A, and using multi-answer loss and post-processing for extractive QA in Task B.

2) The authors thoroughly experiment with multiple pre-trained Arabic language models like AraBERT, CAMeLBERT, and AraELECTRA using different fine-tuning strategies. They share their trained models and code to benefit the NLP community.

3) The authors analyze the impact of factors like ensemble learning, thresholding for unanswerable questions, loss functions, and post-processing through their research questions RQ1-RQ6. This provides useful insights into effective techniques for these QA tasks.

4) The proposed systems outperform the baselines by a large margin, achieving the best MAP of 25.05% on the hidden test set for Task A and pAP@10 of 57.11% for Task B.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing the state-of-the-art for low-resource Qur'an QA by effectively combining Arabic language models, transfer learning, and ensemble methods. The analysis also provides valuable guidelines for tackling such tasks.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes both dual-encoders and cross-encoders approaches for passage retrieval in Task A. What are the key differences between these two approaches and what motivated exploring both in this work?

2. Ensemble learning is used in both tasks to account for inconsistencies among multiple runs. What specific ensemble technique is used and how does it operate for Task A versus Task B? 

3. The paper argues that cross-encoders have higher computational overhead compared to dual-encoders for ranking tasks. Why is that the case and how might this limitation be addressed?

4. External resources are used for transfer learning. What specific external datasets are leveraged and how are they incorporated into the fine-tuning process?

5. Two learning methods, First Answer Loss (FAL) and Multi-Answer Loss (MAL) are proposed. What is the motivation behind MAL and in what way does it differ from the standard FAL approach?

6. Post-processing of the raw LM predictions is utilized. What post-processing technique is adopted and what specific issues does it aim to resolve?  

7. The paper analyzes model performance on both standard and "faithful" splits of the dataset. What is the purpose of the faithful split and what leakage issues does it aim to address?
