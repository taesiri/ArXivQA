# [A Benchmark for Evaluating Machine Translation Metrics on Dialects   Without Standard Orthography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16865)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper evaluates the reliability of machine translation metrics when evaluating translations into dialects without standardized orthographies. The authors collect a new dataset of human translations and human judgments for English-to-Swiss German machine translation outputs across two Swiss German dialects. They benchmark several existing metrics, including string-based metrics like BLEU and chrF as well as learned neural metrics like COMET, and find that they are not robust for evaluating Swiss German, especially at the segment level. The authors then propose modifications to make metrics more robust, including continued pre-training of the underlying language model on Swiss German data and introducing character-level noise during task fine-tuning. While these changes improve performance, results on a challenge set designed to test robustness to spelling variation show there is still substantial room for improvement. The authors offer suggestions for future work toward developing reliable metrics for non-standardized dialects, such as using character-based language models to better handle spelling variability and expanding the benchmark to additional dialects when more machine translation systems for those varieties become available.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates machine translation metrics on their ability to reliably assess translations into Swiss German dialects that lack standardized orthography, finding that while existing metrics perform poorly, especially at the segment level, continued pre-training on Swiss German data and introducing character-level noise during fine-tuning can make learned metrics more robust.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Collecting a new dataset and designing a challenge set for evaluating machine translation metrics on two Swiss German dialects. This includes human translations, human judgments for machine translation outputs, and a challenge set to directly test metric robustness to dialect variations.

2) Benchmarking existing string-based and neural metrics on the new dataset and finding that they are not reliable, especially at the segment level, for evaluating translations into non-standardized dialects like Swiss German.

3) Proposing initial adaptations, like continued language model pre-training on Swiss German data and injecting character-level noise, to make metrics more robust to spelling differences. The results show improvements but there is still significant room for enhancement.

4) Offering recommendations for future research toward developing machine translation metrics that can reliably evaluate quality when translating into languages and dialects without established orthographic standards.

In summary, the key contribution is creating resources and analysis to demonstrate the deficiencies of current metrics on non-standardized dialects, as well as initial experiments to start improving robustness. But substantial future work is still needed in this direction.

The paper focuses on evaluating how robust current machine translation evaluation metrics are when evaluating translations into dialects without a standard orthography, using Swiss German as a case study. It collects human judgment and translation data as well as a challenge set for two Swiss German dialects. The paper then benchmarks several metrics and finds they are not reliable for non-standardized varieties, especially on the segment level. The authors propose modifications like continued language model pre-training and noise injection during metric training to make metrics more dialect-robust. Key metrics studied include BLEU, chrF, and different versions of the COMET framework. Evaluations are conducted at both the system and segment level using metrics like pairwise accuracy.

In summary, the key focus is on machine translation metrics and their reliability for non-standardized dialects.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) This paper focuses on evaluating machine translation metrics for non-standardized dialects. What are some key characteristics of non-standardized dialects that make evaluating MT metrics more challenging compared to standardized language varieties?

2) The paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating MT metrics on Swiss German dialects. What are some key elements of this dataset and how was it constructed? What steps were taken to ensure high quality translations and ratings?

3) The paper experiments with continued pre-training of language models on Swiss German data to make metrics more robust. How was this data sourced and incorporated? What effect did this have on performance compared to just fine-tuning?

4) Noise injection during task fine-tuning is proposed as an alternative way to increase robustness. What is the motivation behind this technique? How is noise implemented and what hyperparameters are used? 

5) Both continued pre-training and noise injection are evaluated individually and combined. What conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of each method and using them together?

6) The paper introduces a challenge set to directly test robustness to spelling variation. Explain how this set was constructed and what metrics were used to evaluate performance on it.

7) What modifications or enhancements could be made to the continued pre-training or noise injection techniques to further improve performance?

8) The limitations discuss only evaluating two Swiss German dialects. What steps could be taken to expand the benchmark to additional non-standardized varieties? What challenges might this introduce?

9) The paper offers suggestions for future work to make metrics more robust. Which of these directions do you think is most promising and why?

10) How well does the paper identify the key challenges involved in evaluating MT systems that generate text in non-standardized dialects? What open questions remain about this problem?
