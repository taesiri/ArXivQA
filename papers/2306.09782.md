# [Full Parameter Fine-tuning for Large Language Models with Limited   Resources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09782)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:

Can full parameter fine-tuning of large language models be enabled on limited computational resources through algorithmic and engineering optimizations? 

The authors aim to explore techniques to enable full parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters on resource-constrained hardware like a single machine with 8 GPUs. Their goal is to lower the threshold for training LLMs and make them more accessible to smaller labs/companies. To address this, they propose a new optimizer called LOMO that reduces memory usage and enables full parameter tuning of LLMs within limited resources. The main hypotheses seem to be:

- SGD can successfully fine-tune the full parameters of LLMs, despite issues that previously hindered its widespread usage.

- By fusing gradient computation and parameter update in one step, LOMO can significantly reduce memory usage compared to standard approaches.

- With memory optimization techniques like LOMO, full parameter fine-tuning of large LLMs is feasible on resource-limited hardware.

So in summary, the central research question/hypothesis is around enabling full parameter LLM fine-tuning on limited resources through an optimized training process, with LOMO being the proposed technique. The authors aim to experimentally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- The proposal of LOMO (LOw-Memory Optimization), a new optimizer that fuses gradient computation and parameter update to significantly reduce memory usage during training. This enables full parameter fine-tuning of large language models with limited computational resources. 

- Analysis of the four aspects of memory usage during LLM training - activations, optimizer states, gradient tensors, and parameters. LOMO specifically reduces the memory overhead of optimizer states and gradient tensors.

- Empirical evaluation demonstrating LOMO's ability to reduce memory usage to just 10.8% compared to standard approaches. This allows training a 65B model on a single machine with 8 GPUs.

- Throughput tests showing LOMO's higher throughput compared to AdamW and SGD optimizers, especially when training larger models. This is attributed to the memory savings and reduced communication costs.

- Downstream task performance experiments on SuperGLUE showing comparable or better results using LOMO compared to zero-shot and LoRA methods. This validates that LOMO can effectively fine-tune LLMs without compromising performance.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of LOMO to enable full parameter fine-tuning of large language models using limited computational resources, with empirical validation of its memory efficiency, throughput, and downstream task performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new optimizer called LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO) that enables full parameter fine-tuning of large language models with limited computational resources by fusing gradient computation and parameter update to minimize memory usage.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of efficient training of large language models:

- The focus on full parameter fine-tuning is quite unique. Most prior work has looked at parameter-efficient methods like adapter tuning or prompt tuning that only update a small subset of parameters. This paper tackles the more challenging problem of how to fine-tune all the parameters of a large model with limited compute. 

- The analysis of memory usage during training and breakdown of contributions from activations, gradients, optimizer states etc. is very thorough. Many papers overlook this level of detail. Identifying optimizer states as a major contributor is an important insight.

- The proposal of LOMO - fusing gradient computation and parameter updates to avoid storing gradients - is a simple but clever idea. Similar tricks have been used in other domains but the application to language model tuning is novel.

- Combining techniques like LOMO, activation checkpointing, mixed precision training etc. to push the boundaries of training large models on single machines with consumer GPUs is impactful. Enabling more researchers to work with bigger models is important.

- The experiments validate LOMO can match/exceed the performance of methods like Adam and Lora, and scale up to models with 65B parameters on modest GPUs. This demonstrates the real-world applicability of the approach.

- One limitation is that the theoretical motivation for why SGD is sufficient for LLMs could be expanded. The empirical results support this, but more analysis of the loss landscapes and comparison to small models would strengthen the arguments.

Overall, I find this paper to make excellent contributions in terms of both engineering insights to reduce memory usage and clever algorithmic modifications to enable efficient full parameter tuning. The techniques open up opportunities to democratize large language model research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring parameter quantization techniques to further reduce memory usage. Since parameters occupy most of the memory when training with LOMO, the authors suggest investigating methods like quantization to compress parameters and lower memory requirements.

- Delving into more applicable scenarios and use cases for LOMO. The authors propose testing LOMO in more practical settings beyond the SuperGLUE experiments presented in the paper.

- Conducting more theoretical analysis into optimizing large language models. The authors call for more research into the theory behind effectively training large models, which can provide valuable insights to advance the field.

- Evaluating the performance of SGD versus modern optimizers like Adam more rigorously. While the authors provide some initial intuition and analysis, they suggest this comparison could be explored more thoroughly. 

- Investigating alternatives to gradient clipping and normalization that are compatible with LOMO's design. The authors discuss some proposed methods like clipping losses directly, but encourage further work in this direction.

- Exploring the potential benefits of a grouped gradient clipping approach. The authors hypothesize this could provide a dynamic learning rate effect, but leave rigorous examination as future work.

- Combining LOMO with parameter-efficient methods like LoRA. The authors empirically show compatibility, but propose more research into joint techniques.

- Testing LOMO on more tasks and datasets. The authors focus on SuperGLUE, but suggest expanding to other benchmarks to further validate effectiveness.

In summary, the authors recommend several promising avenues centered around reducing memory further, applying LOMO more widely, deepening theoretical understanding, and improving techniques for optimization and stability when training large models with limited resources.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new optimizer called LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO) to enable full parameter fine-tuning of large language models with limited computational resources. The authors analyze the four components of memory usage during training - activations, optimizer states, gradient tensors, and parameters. To reduce memory, LOMO replaces Adam with SGD since it doesn't require optimizer states, fuses gradient computation and parameter updates to avoid storing gradients, and uses activation checkpointing. For training stability, alternatives to gradient clipping are proposed. Experiments show LOMO reduces memory usage to just 10.8% of the standard approach and achieves strong performance tuning a 65B parameter model on SuperGLUE using 8 GPUs. LOMO makes full parameter tuning of large models feasible with limited resources.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), a new optimizer that enables full parameter fine-tuning of large language models with limited computational resources. The key innovation of LOMO is fusing gradient computation and parameter update in one step, which dramatically reduces memory usage. By replacing Adam with SGD and eliminating the need to store optimizer states or full gradients, LOMO reduces memory to just model parameters and a small number of activations. To stabilize training, the authors propose techniques like per-layer gradient clipping and loss scaling. When combined with existing methods like activation checkpointing and mixed precision, LOMO reduces memory to just 10.8% of the baseline. This allows successfully fine-tuning a 65 billion parameter model on a single machine with 8 GPUs. Experiments on SuperGLUE benchmark datasets demonstrate LOMO matches or improves accuracy compared to methods like zero-shot and LoRA, while using orders of magnitude less memory.

In summary, this paper makes full parameter fine-tuning feasible on commodity hardware by proposing an extremely memory efficient optimizer. LOMO works by fusing the gradient computation and parameter update, enabling training giant models using GPUs with just 24GB memory. Experiments validate LOMO's ability to optimize large language models at up to 65 billion parameters, while achieving strong accuracy on NLP tasks. The approach greatly lowers the barrier to working with gigantic language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper proposes a new optimizer called LOw-MemOry Optimization (LOMO) that enables full parameter fine-tuning of large language models with limited computational resources. The key idea is to fuse the gradient computation and parameter update steps into one, such that model parameters can be updated in-place without needing to store the full gradient tensors in memory. Specifically, during backpropagation, each parameter is updated immediately after receiving its gradient, after which the gradient is discarded. This reduces the memory overhead from storing gradients for all parameters to just storing the gradient of one parameter at a time. To stabilize training, the paper employs techniques like clipping gradients by value, loss scaling, and casting some operations to full precision. When combined with existing memory reduction techniques like activation checkpointing, LOMO allows successful full parameter tuning of models up to 65B parameters on a single machine with 8 GPUs. Experiments on SuperGLUE datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of LOMO for optimizing large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to enable full parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) with limited computational resources. 

Specifically, the paper points out that existing approaches for optimizing LLMs under resource constraints have focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which only tunes or adds a small subset of parameters. However, full parameter fine-tuning is acknowledged to be a more powerful approach. The key challenge is that full fine-tuning requires extensive GPU memory for storing model parameters, activations, gradients, and optimizer states. This makes full fine-tuning infeasible for smaller labs/companies with limited GPU resources.

To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a new optimizer called LOMO (Low-Memory Optimization) that aims to significantly reduce the GPU memory footprint of full parameter fine-tuning for LLMs. The key ideas are:

- Using SGD instead of Adam to eliminate optimizer state memory.
- Fusing gradient computation and parameter update to avoid storing full gradient tensors. 
- Combining with activation checkpointing to reduce activation storage.
- Stabilization techniques like loss scaling for mixed precision training.

Through these techniques, the paper shows LOMO can reduce the memory usage to just slightly more than what is needed for inference. This enables successfully fine-tuning a 65B parameter model on a single machine with 8 x 24GB GPUs, demonstrating the promise of LOMO for opening up full fine-tuning to more researchers with limited resources.
