# [Streaming Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01297)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Streaming Dense Video Captioning":

Problem:
- Dense video captioning aims to jointly localize events temporally in a video and generate detailed captions for them. 
- Current models have limitations in handling long input videos and outputting long, detailed captions. They typically downsample the video frames aggressively or make predictions only after seeing the entire video.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a streaming dense video captioning model with two key components:
  1. A memory module based on clustering video frame features into a fixed number of tokens. This allows handling arbitrarily long videos.
  2. A streaming decoding algorithm that makes predictions from intermediate "decoding points" in the video timeline before seeing the full video. Earlier predictions are provided as context to avoid duplicates.

Main Contributions:
- A clustering-based memory module that keeps diverse information from past video frames in a fixed size representation, enabling streaming processing.
- A streaming decoding algorithm that makes predictions from multiple timestamps along the video, providing better supervision and aiding generalization.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on ActivityNet, YouCook2 and ViTT datasets, improving performance substantially over prior work.
- Shows consistent improvements when added to both GIT and VidSeq model architectures.
- The proposed streaming approach is simple, scalable and applicable to live video streams.

In summary, the paper presents a novel streaming model for dense video captioning that can handle long videos and output detailed captions before seeing the full video. It substantially pushes state-of-the-art through an effective combination of a clustering memory module and a streaming decoding algorithm.
