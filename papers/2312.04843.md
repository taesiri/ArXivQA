# [FREDSum: A Dialogue Summarization Corpus for French Political Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04843)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces FREDSum, the first French dataset for abstractive debate summarization containing manually transcribed and annotated political debates. The debates cover diverse topics and perspectives and include multiple types of annotations - abstractive summaries, extractive summaries, and abstractive communities linking extractive utterances to sentences in the abstractive summaries. Experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art summarization methods such as BARThez, OpenAssistant, and ChatGPT on this new dataset using metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore as well as human evaluation. Results show ChatGPT produces the most competitive system summaries, outperforming on both automatic metrics and human judgment of readability, informativity and faithfulness. The paper also releases large preprocessed French corpora for pretraining consisting of National Assembly and Senate data. Limitations around dataset size and lack of linguistic annotations are discussed, as are considerations of bias and fairness in dealing with political data. Overall, the new dataset enables progress on French and multilingual dialogue and debate summarization while highlighting opportunities for future improvement.
