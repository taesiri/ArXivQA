# [PyroTrack: Belief-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning Path Planning for   Aerial Wildfire Monitoring in Partially Observable Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Wildfires are increasingly frequent and costly, highlighting the need for effective wildfire management systems. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have promising capabilities for aerial imaging and early wildfire detection/monitoring. However, tracking the propagation of the fire frontline in real-time with a UAV is challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of wildfires, as well as limitations of UAVs such as limited flight time, field-of-view, and onboard processing capabilities.

- This paper studies the problem of developing an optimal path planning solution for a UAV to actively detect and monitor wildfires, while considering realistic constraints faced in practice. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) since the UAV has limited visibility of the full environment state.

Proposed Solution:
- A belief-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution is proposed for the UAV path planning problem to maximize wildfire detection and monitoring objectives, while conforming to UAV limitations. 

- The solution has two phases - a scanning phase to initialize beliefs, and a tracking phase to execute the policy. The state representation relies on updated "belief maps" that estimate fire probability per grid cell, instead of raw noisy observations. These belief maps are updated using Bayesian rules and capture hidden factors affecting fire spread.

- A deep Q-network (DQN) is used with separate branches for belief maps and UAV state parameters. The reward function encodes fire detection/tracking objectives as well as constraints such as battery usage penalties.

Main Contributions:
- Realistic wildfire simulation environment modeling factors like vegetation density, fuels, wind patterns affecting spread.
- Belief map framework to address partial observability challenges and inaccurate state estimates.
- Evaluation of belief-based solution against observation-based baseline, analyzing fire coverage ratio and monitored ignition area metrics.
- Analysis of UAV trajectories show that the proposed approach allows efficient path adaptation in complex dynamic fire scenarios.

The key novelty lies in using belief space planning to efficiently track wildfires under UAV limitations, outperforming approaches relying only on local observations. The belief representation shows promising adaptation capability even with limited training data availability.
