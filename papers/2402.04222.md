# [What is 'Typological Diversity' in NLP?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most NLP research focuses on English, but multilingual NLP is important for generalization. Typological diversity of languages is commonly used to justify language selection and claims of generalization. 
- However, there is no consistent definition or methodology for claims of "typological diversity" in NLP papers.

Analysis:
- Systematically analyzed 110 papers that make typological diversity claims regarding language selection.
- Found no standard definition or criteria - justifications ranged from none, to language families, to specific typological features.
- Proposed metrics to quantify diversity: average syntactic distance between languages (MPSD) and coverage of typological feature values.
- Observed high variation in diversity metrics across papers, even though all claim "typological diversity".

Implications:
- Skewed language selection can lead to overestimated multilingual performance, if averaged naively across languages. 
- Grouped XTREME-R benchmark by morphological and word order typological features - considerable variation in performance.
- Highlights need for clearly defined notion of "typological diversity" when making claims, to enable analysis of what linguistic phenomena are covered.

Recommendations:
- Papers using "typologically diverse" should document language selection process and include empirical diversity measure like average distance or feature coverage. 
- Can give insights into multilingual difficulties and guide better language sampling for evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic survey of "typological diversity" claims in NLP papers
- Demonstrated issues with lack of definition - variation in actual diversity
- Proposed syntactic distance and feature coverage metrics to quantify language selection diversity 
- Showed implications on multilingual evaluation
- Provided recommendations for better documenting language selection
