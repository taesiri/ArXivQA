# [What is 'Typological Diversity' in NLP?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04222)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most NLP research focuses on English, but multilingual NLP is important for generalization. Typological diversity of languages is commonly used to justify language selection and claims of generalization. 
- However, there is no consistent definition or methodology for claims of "typological diversity" in NLP papers.

Analysis:
- Systematically analyzed 110 papers that make typological diversity claims regarding language selection.
- Found no standard definition or criteria - justifications ranged from none, to language families, to specific typological features.
- Proposed metrics to quantify diversity: average syntactic distance between languages (MPSD) and coverage of typological feature values.
- Observed high variation in diversity metrics across papers, even though all claim "typological diversity".

Implications:
- Skewed language selection can lead to overestimated multilingual performance, if averaged naively across languages. 
- Grouped XTREME-R benchmark by morphological and word order typological features - considerable variation in performance.
- Highlights need for clearly defined notion of "typological diversity" when making claims, to enable analysis of what linguistic phenomena are covered.

Recommendations:
- Papers using "typologically diverse" should document language selection process and include empirical diversity measure like average distance or feature coverage. 
- Can give insights into multilingual difficulties and guide better language sampling for evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic survey of "typological diversity" claims in NLP papers
- Demonstrated issues with lack of definition - variation in actual diversity
- Proposed syntactic distance and feature coverage metrics to quantify language selection diversity 
- Showed implications on multilingual evaluation
- Provided recommendations for better documenting language selection


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper systematically investigates how the term "typological diversity" is used in NLP research, finds no consistent definitions or metrics, analyzes current practices, and shows how skewed language selection can impact multilingual model evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

1) It systematically investigates how the term "typological diversity" is used in NLP research by surveying the literature and analyzing 110 papers that make claims about typological diversity. 

2) It finds that there is no consistent definition or criteria used when making "typological diversity" claims. The justifications provided range from none, to using language phylogeny as a proxy, to selecting languages based on a subset of typological features.

3) It introduces metrics to approximate the actual typological diversity of language selections used in papers along axes like syntactic distance and typological feature value inclusion. It shows there is considerable variation in diversity across papers.

4) It demonstrates that skewed language selection can lead to overestimated multilingual performance, by grouping model results on the XTREME-R benchmark by morphological and syntactic typological features.

5) It recommends that future work clearly define and empirically justify claims of "typological diversity" in language selection to support robust conclusions about multilingual NLP systems.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic analysis showing the need for more principled use of "typological diversity" claims and providing recommendations for improving language selection and reporting in multilingual NLP research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Typological diversity - The main concept discussed in analyzing how this term is used and defined in NLP research when making claims about language selection.

- Language sampling - Selecting a set of languages to use for evaluation in order to make claims about multilingual model performance. The paper analyzes approaches and justifications made for "typologically diverse" language sampling.

- Generalizability - A goal of multilingual NLP, using a diverse language sample is assumed to lead to more robust models that generalize across languages. The paper questions common assumptions made about diversity and generalizability. 

- Linguistic typology - The study and classification of structural features across world languages. Used as a basis for selecting "typologically diverse" language samples in NLP.

- Language distance - Quantified difference between languages using typological databases like URIEL. One metric the paper introduces to approximate diversity.  

- Typological feature inclusion - Analysis of how well a language sample covers the range of values for typological features like word order. Another diversity approximation.

- Skewed language selection - When certain languages are over-represented in experiments, leading to biased results. The paper shows this can inflate multilingual performance estimates.

Some other terms are bibliographic bias, morphological complexity, low-resource languages. But the main focus is on typological diversity and issues with how it is defined and used in multilingual NLP research.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that most papers claiming to use "typologically diverse" languages do not provide clear definitions or criteria for this claim. What specific guidance does the paper offer for how future work can better justify and quantify claims of typological diversity in language selection?

2. The mean pairwise syntactic distance (MPSD) metric is introduced in Section 3.1 to approximate the typological diversity of a language sample. What are some potential limitations of using the MPSD measure on its own to claim typological diversity, and how could it be supplemented?  

3. Section 3.2 discusses measuring the inclusion of different typological feature values as another way to quantify diversity. Why is this an important complement to simply looking at the pairwise distances between languages? What insights can analyzing feature value coverage provide?

4. How does the paper argue that inconsistent language selection practices can affect the reliability and generalizability of multilingual model evaluations? Provide specific examples explored in the analysis.  

5. The paper finds variation in how notions of genealogical vs. typological diversity are used to motivate language selection. How do practices differ between linguistics and NLP research in this area, and what guidance does the paper offer?

6. What relationship does the paper find between the number of languages selected and the resulting typological diversity, as measured by MPSD and feature inclusion? Why can simply adding more languages not reliably increase diversity?

7. The XTREME-R case study groups languages by morphological and syntactic properties. What patterns emerge from this analysis in terms of model performance across language groups? What implications are discussed?

8. What recommendations does the paper make regarding operationalizing and reporting on notions of "typological diversity" in future NLP research? What specific metrics or analyses are suggested?

9. How could the limitations discussed in Section 5 affect the reliability of the paper's analyses and conclusions? How might future work expand on these analyses?  

10. If you were using claims of "typological diversity" in a new multilingual NLP paper, what specific steps would you take to avoid the issues raised in this work? What analyses would you perform to support diversity claims?
