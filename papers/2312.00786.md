## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Dense Optical Tracking (DOT), a novel approach that unifies point tracking and optical flow techniques for dense motion estimation. DOT first extracts a small set of tracks from key regions using an off-the-shelf point tracker. It then computes rough flow and visibility estimates between source and target frames through nearest-neighbor interpolation. These initial estimates are refined using a learnable optical flow module that explicitly handles occlusions. DOT leverages the accuracy of point tracking with the efficiency and spatial smoothness of optical flow. Experiments on the CVO and TAP benchmarks demonstrate that DOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optical flow techniques and matches or exceeds sophisticated point trackers in terms of accuracy, while being over 100 times faster. DOT also shows improved performance on longer videos with fast motion. The method's flexibility, speed and accuracy make it a promising approach for various video applications requiring dense motion information.
