## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Face recognition (FR) systems based on deep learning have become widely used in many applications, but their decision-making processes are complex and unintuitive. There is a need to increase the transparency and interpretability of these FR systems. Prior work on explainable face verification (XFV) has limitations such as only providing explanations for "Accept" decisions, being inefficient, or producing noisy saliency maps.

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a new method called Feature-Guided Gradient Backpropagation (FGGB) to generate precise and efficient similarity and dissimilarity saliency maps that explain the "Accept" and "Reject" decisions made by an FR system. 

Key Ideas of FGGB:
- Performs gradient backpropagation from the deep feature level in a channel-wise manner rather than from the final verification score. This results in multiple gradient maps highlighting facial regions corresponding to each feature channel.
- Accumulates the gradient maps into saliency maps using a weight vector defined as the channel-wise cosine similarity between the two face features. This gives higher weight to the most discriminative features.
- Decomposes the accumulated saliency map into similarity and dissimilarity maps based on the sign of the values.

Main Contributions:
- Conceives an efficient and model-agnostic saliency explanation method FGGB that provides both similarity and dissimilarity maps to explain FR decisions.
- Addresses limitations of prior work - explains both "Accept" and "Reject"; efficient as based on backpropagation; prevents noisy gradients via feature-level backpropagation and channel-wise weighting.   
- Extensive experiments show FGGB generates more precise saliency maps compared to state-of-the-art, especially for dissimilarity maps.
- Validates generalizability of FGGB by testing on multiple FR models.
- Provides insights into improving gradient-based explanation methods by exploring feature-level backpropagation and weighting to address noisy gradient issue.
