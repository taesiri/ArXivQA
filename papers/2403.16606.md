# [ROXIE: Defining a Robotic eXplanation and Interpretability Engine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As autonomous robots become more prevalent in public spaces, there is an urgent need to make their decision-making processes transparent and interpretable to humans. Lack of explainability and interpretability leads to lack of trust between humans and robots. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a Robotic eXplanation and Interpretability Engine (ROXIE) to address this problem. ROXIE consists of three main components:

1. Robotic Explanation Framework Toolkit (REFT): Provides tools to generate explanations about robot decision-making processes and make them transparent.

2. Robotic Interpretability Framework Toolkit (RIFT): Provides tools to adapt the generated explanations into forms intelligible for end users, based on their knowledge levels.

3. Robotic Accountability Framework Toolkit (RAFT): Provides tools like standardized "black boxes" to record robot data for investigations into accidents/incidents involving robots.

Two overarching requirements are also highlighted: Cybersecurity and use of natural language to present information.

Main Contributions:

- Identifies key requirements for explainability and interpretability in autonomous robots
- Provides conceptual overview of REFT, RIFT and RAFT to fulfill these requirements 
- Shows how existing ROS2 tools can be integrated into the framework
- Proposes an end-to-end flow of generating and presenting explanations to end users
- Discusses the need for measuring interpretability based on users' knowledge levels

The paper lays the groundwork for developing transparent and interpretable decision-making capabilities in autonomous robots via the proposed ROXIE framework.
