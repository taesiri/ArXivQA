# [Neural Image Compression with Quantization Rectifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Neural Image Compression with Quantization Rectifier":

Problem:
- Neural image compression methods use quantization to enable efficient entropy coding, but quantization introduces errors that degrade image quality. 
- Existing methods address train-test mismatch from quantization but do not resolve the random impact of quantization on feature expressiveness.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel Quantization Rectifier (QR) method to mitigate the impact of quantization. 
- Design a QR network architecture that leverages spatial image correlation to predict unquantized features from quantized ones. This preserves feature expressiveness for better reconstruction.
- Develop a Soft-to-Predictive (STP) training technique to seamlessly integrate QR into existing image codecs. STP first softly trains the codec end-to-end, then freezes the encoder and hard quantization and optimizes the decoder and QR.

Main Contributions:
- Propose QR method and network architecture that corrects quantized features through prediction to improve coding efficiency.
- Introduce STP training procedure and hyperparameter selection algorithm for integrating QR into image codecs.
- Evaluate QR by enhancing state-of-the-art image codecs. Results show consistent improvement across codecs with negligible overhead. QR improves PSNR by up to 0.21 dB and MS-SSIM by up to 0.25 dB.

In summary, this paper presents a novel Quantization Rectifier technique to address the impact of quantization noise in neural image compression. By predicting unquantized features from quantized ones, QR is able to preserve feature expressiveness and achieve superior image reconstruction quality. The proposed training methodology also allows easy integration with existing codecs. Experiments demonstrate consistent and significant gains across various state-of-the-art baselines.
