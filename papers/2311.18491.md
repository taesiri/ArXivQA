# [ZeST-NeRF: Using temporal aggregation for Zero-Shot Temporal NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18491)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ZeST-NeRF, a new approach for novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes in a "zero-shot" manner, meaning it can generalize to new scenes without requiring per-scene optimization or retraining. The key innovation is the use of two specialized neural encoding volumes, one capturing static scene geometry and one capturing short-term motion correlations, which are used to condition separate static and dynamic neural radiance fields. At test time, these components can synthesize novel views for unseen scenes by reasoning about structure and motion in a scene-agnostic way. Experiments on complex real-world videos demonstrate state-of-the-art results for cross-scene generalization, with both quantitative metrics and visual quality improved by over 15% compared to prior work. Ablations validate the importance of having separate static and dynamic representations. Limitations remain in terms of some artifacts for rapidly-moving regions, but the work constitutes a major advancement for efficient novel view synthesis without exhaustive per-scene training. Key applications include media production and XR.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

ZeST-NeRF proposes a new approach for generating novel view videos of complex scenes in a zero-shot manner by using a geometry encoding volume to inform a static NeRF and a motion encoding volume to inform a dynamic NeRF in order to accurately reconstruct both static background elements and dynamic motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ZeST-NeRF, the first radiance field approach capable of "zero-shot" novel viewpoint rendering in completely unseen videos of complex scenes. Specifically:

1) It proposes an efficient multi-encoding-volume approach to scene-agnostic video representation, using both a geometry volume and a motion volume. 

2) It demonstrates a new model that can produce temporal NeRF renderings for new scenes without needing to retrain, by estimating structure and motion in a scene-agnostic way.

3) It establishes a new evaluation protocol and newly developed baselines for the problem of "zero-shot" novel-viewpoint-rendering in video.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to generate new camera views from unseen dynamic video footage, without requiring expensive per-scene optimization. This is enabled by aggregating information across frames and videos in an efficient learned encoding to resolve ambiguities.

The paper proposes a new approach called "ZeST-NeRF" which stands for Zero-Shot Temporal NeRF. It focuses on the task of novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes in a zero-shot manner, meaning it can generalize to new scenes without needing per-scene fine-tuning. The key ideas include using a geometry volume and motion volume to inform a static and dynamic NeRF, leveraging ideas like plane sweep volumes and scene flow to enable generalization. So the core topics relate to novel view synthesis, NeRFs, dynamic scenes, and zero-shot generalization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using both a static and a dynamic neural radiance field to represent scenes. Why is using two separate networks useful compared to having a single combined network? What are the tradeoffs?

2. Scene flow estimation is used to aggregate information between frames. How does estimating scene flow help resolve ambiguities compared to other approaches like optical flow? What are some of the challenges with using scene flow?

3. The paper uses both a geometry volume and a motion volume as input to the neural radiance fields. What is the motivation behind using two separate volumes? What unique information does each volume capture? 

4. Weakly-supervised pretraining is used to initialize the model before the full training. Why is this helpful? What limitations exist with relying solely on the optical flow and depth estimation for supervision?

5. The model is evaluated using a cross-validation approach on the Dynamic Scenes dataset. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this evaluation protocol compared to a simple train/test split?

6. Several regularisation losses are used during training such as cycle consistency and scene flow smoothness. Why are these useful? How sensitive is performance to these additional losses?

7. The paper claims the model can generalize to new scenes in a "zero-shot" manner. What exactly does zero-shot generalization refer to in this context and what evidence supports this claim? What are the limitations?

8. How does the model handle disocclusion and occlusion explicitly? Why is this an important problem to solve for view synthesis of dynamic scenes? How does the approach compare to prior work?

9. The model architecture contains several design choices such as specific MLP structures and positional encodings. How important are these choices to the overall performance? How might the design change for different applications?

10. The paper demonstrates results on complex real-world scenes with people performing various actions. What types of motions and scenes would be more difficult for the current method to handle? How might the approach be extended or modified to address this?
