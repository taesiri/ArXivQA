# [Multiscale Tensor Decomposition and Rendering Equation Encoding for View   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03808)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the quality of view synthesis from multi-view images. The key hypotheses are:

1. Representing a scene with a multiscale tensor decomposition will lead to faster convergence and better rendering quality compared to a single-scale representation. 

2. Encoding the rendering equation in the feature space will facilitate modeling complex view-dependent effects compared to directly encoding the view directions.

Specifically, the paper proposes a new method called the neural radiance feature field (NRFF) with two main contributions:

1. A multiscale tensor decomposition scheme to represent scenes from coarse to fine scales. This is shown to enable faster convergence and better rendering quality with fewer learnable features compared to single-scale methods.

2. Encoding the rendering equation in the feature space using anisotropic spherical Gaussians instead of directly encoding view directions. This provides the MLP with more knowledge about the rendering process to better model view-dependent effects.

The central hypothesis is that combining these two ideas - multiscale representation and rendering equation encoding - will advance the quality of view synthesis compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the efficacy of the proposed NRFF method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel multiscale tensor decomposition (MTD) scheme to represent scenes from coarse to fine scales. This enables faster convergence and better rendering quality compared to a single-scale representation. 

2. Proposing a rendering equation encoding (REE) method to encode the rendering equation in the feature space instead of directly encoding view directions. This provides the MLP with more knowledge about the outgoing radiance to better model complex view-dependent effects.

In summary, the key ideas presented are:

- Using multiscale tensor decomposition to represent scenes, improving over a single-scale representation. 

- Encoding the rendering equation in the feature space rather than just encoding view directions, which better informs the MLP about light transport.

The combination of these two ideas results in the proposed neural radiance feature field (NRFF) method, which achieves state-of-the-art view synthesis results on both synthetic and real datasets as demonstrated experimentally.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel neural radiance feature field (NRFF) method for view synthesis that uses multiscale tensor decomposition to represent scenes at varying scales and encodes the rendering equation in the feature space to better model complex view-dependent effects.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in neural rendering:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new neural scene representation called the neural radiance feature field (NRFF). It combines learnable features organized in a multiscale tensor decomposition with encoding the rendering equation in the feature space. 

- Using learnable features organized in data structures is an emerging approach for neural rendering, as an alternative to pure MLP-based representations like NeRF. This allows more efficient scene representation and rendering compared to MLPs. Some other works have explored grids, trees, hash tables etc. The multiscale tensor decomposition used here provides benefits over single-scale methods.

- Encoding the rendering equation in feature space is a novel idea proposed in this paper. Most other works encode view directions directly. Modeling the rendering equation provides richer information about light transport to the MLP, and the results show it helps achieve better view dependent effects.

- Quantitative results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate NRFF outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR and other metrics. The improvements over TensoRF, another tensor decomposition method, are particularly significant.

- Subjective quality also looks improved over other methods like TensoRF when examining texture details, specularities, and geometry. The visualizations of the learned encoding functions provide insight into how the rendering equation modeling helps capture view dependent effects.

- A limitation is that the method is slower than very optimized approaches like MHE and DVGO, but faster than pure MLP methods. There is scope for further optimizing the efficiency.

In summary, the multiscale representation and novel rendering equation encoding allow NRFF to achieve new state-of-the-art results in neural rendering. The comparisons quantify gains over existing works, and highlight the benefits of the proposed techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the computational efficiency of the model, as the current model is relatively slow compared to some other recent methods like MHE and DVGO. The authors suggest optimizations like moving plane features to GPU textures could help.

- Exploring ways to reduce the size of the MLPs used while maintaining rendering quality. The current model uses quite large MLPs compared to some other feature-based methods.

- Extending the multiscale representation and rendering equation encoding ideas to tasks beyond novel view synthesis, such as scene relighting, material editing, etc. 

- Applying the proposed methods to represent dynamic scenes with non-rigid motion. The current method focuses on static scenes.

- Evaluating the generalizability of the model on more diverse and challenging real-world datasets. More real-world experiments could reveal limitations to address.

- Combining the proposed techniques with some complementary ideas from other recent works, such as the hash encoding used in MHE or the transformer used in NerFormer.

- Developing unsupervised or self-supervised training methods to avoid requiring posed multi-view image datasets.

In summary, the main future directions relate to improving efficiency, generalization, and expanding the scope of tasks and scenes the model can handle. Combining ideas from other concurrent works on neural scene representations is also suggested as a promising direction.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel neural radiance feature field (NRFF) approach for high-quality view synthesis. The key ideas are:

1. A multiscale tensor decomposition (MTD) scheme is proposed to represent scenes from coarse to fine scales. This enables faster convergence and better rendering quality compared to single-scale methods. 

2. Instead of directly encoding view directions, the rendering equation is encoded in the feature space using anisotropic spherical Gaussians (ASGs). This provides the MLP with more knowledge about the light transport to facilitate modeling complex view-dependent effects.

Specifically, the scene is represented by two MTD fields for density and appearance. The feature vectors from all scales are fed to MLPs to predict rendering parameters and ASG mixture. The ASG mixture encodes the rendering equation in the feature space. Finally, volume rendering with the predicted densities and colors is performed for view synthesis. Experiments show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of photo-realistic view synthesis from multi-view images. More specifically, it aims to improve the quality of novel view rendering compared to existing neural rendering methods like NeRF. The key questions it tries to address are:
