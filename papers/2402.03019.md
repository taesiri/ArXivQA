# [Taylor Videos for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Taylor Videos for Action Recognition":

Problem:
- Effectively extracting motions from videos is critical for action recognition but is challenging because (i) motions do not have an explicit form, (ii) motions have various concepts like displacement, velocity, acceleration, (iii) motions often contain noise from unstable pixels. 

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose Taylor video, a new video format that highlights the dominant motions in each frame called Taylor frame. 
- Taylor video is named after Taylor series which approximates a function using important terms. Here the implicit motion-extraction function aims to extract motion from video blocks.
- Using video frames, difference frames, and higher-order differences, Taylor expansion approximates this function at the starting frame. 
- The summation of higher-order terms gives dominant motions while removing static objects and unstable, small motions.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce Taylor video as an alternative to RGB video and optical flow to extract motions for action recognition. Its computation comes from a application of Taylor series to videos.
- Taylor video quickly computes from RGB video, can be high resolution, and dynamically captures different levels of dominant motions.
- Demonstrate Taylor video is competitive with and complementary to RGB video and optical flow. When combined, further improvement is observed. 
- Confirm effectiveness using 2D CNNs, 3D CNNs and transformers on datasets with moving cameras, tiny actions and long-term motions.

In summary, the paper proposes Taylor video, a new video representation for action recognition that highlights dominant motions in each frame. Experiments show Taylor video is effective on its own and complementary to RGB and optical flow inputs.
