# [Neural Relighting with Subsurface Scattering by Learning the Radiance   Transfer Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop a neural rendering approach that can faithfully reconstruct and relight objects with subsurface scattering effects under varying lighting conditions?The key aspects of this question are:- Reconstructing objects with subsurface scattering effects - many existing methods struggle with materials that exhibit subsurface scattering, where light scatters beneath the surface before exiting. This is difficult to model with simple surface reflectance models like BRDFs.- Relighting under varying conditions - the goal is to produce a model that can render the object accurately under novel lighting, which requires disentangling lighting from material properties.- Using a neural rendering approach - the paper aims to address this problem using neural representation and optimization techniques, rather than relying solely on physically-based rendering models.So in summary, the core research question is how to use neural rendering to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and relighting of objects with subsurface scattering effects under varying illumination. The proposed method aims to make progress on this problem.
