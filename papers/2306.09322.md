# [Neural Relighting with Subsurface Scattering by Learning the Radiance   Transfer Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop a neural rendering approach that can faithfully reconstruct and relight objects with subsurface scattering effects under varying lighting conditions?The key aspects of this question are:- Reconstructing objects with subsurface scattering effects - many existing methods struggle with materials that exhibit subsurface scattering, where light scatters beneath the surface before exiting. This is difficult to model with simple surface reflectance models like BRDFs.- Relighting under varying conditions - the goal is to produce a model that can render the object accurately under novel lighting, which requires disentangling lighting from material properties.- Using a neural rendering approach - the paper aims to address this problem using neural representation and optimization techniques, rather than relying solely on physically-based rendering models.So in summary, the core research question is how to use neural rendering to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and relighting of objects with subsurface scattering effects under varying illumination. The proposed method aims to make progress on this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper appears to be a novel framework for learning the radiance transfer field via volume rendering and utilizing various appearance cues to refine geometry end-to-end. This framework extends relighting and reconstruction capabilities to handle a wider range of materials in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, the key contributions seem to be:- A volume rendering approach to estimate the transfer field and utilize appearance cues to refine the geometry in an end-to-end fashion. This allows optimizing geometry details with appearance cues.- The framework does not assume a particular material representation (like BRDF or BSSRDF), making it applicable to a wide range of materials with global illumination and subsurface scattering effects. - The method produces high quality visual results on real-world objects with significant subsurface scattering captured in a light stage. It compares favorably to prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.- A new light stage dataset of objects with subsurface scattering is collected and will be released to facilitate research in this area. The dataset features high resolution captures with varying lighting.In summary, the key novelty appears to be the end-to-end volume rendering framework for optimizing radiance transfer fields, which extends neural relighting capabilities to materials with subsurface scattering in a more general and data-driven manner.
