# [Neural Relighting with Subsurface Scattering by Learning the Radiance   Transfer Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a neural rendering approach that can faithfully reconstruct and relight objects with subsurface scattering effects under varying lighting conditions?

The key aspects of this question are:

- Reconstructing objects with subsurface scattering effects - many existing methods struggle with materials that exhibit subsurface scattering, where light scatters beneath the surface before exiting. This is difficult to model with simple surface reflectance models like BRDFs.

- Relighting under varying conditions - the goal is to produce a model that can render the object accurately under novel lighting, which requires disentangling lighting from material properties.

- Using a neural rendering approach - the paper aims to address this problem using neural representation and optimization techniques, rather than relying solely on physically-based rendering models.

So in summary, the core research question is how to use neural rendering to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and relighting of objects with subsurface scattering effects under varying illumination. The proposed method aims to make progress on this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be a novel framework for learning the radiance transfer field via volume rendering and utilizing various appearance cues to refine geometry end-to-end. This framework extends relighting and reconstruction capabilities to handle a wider range of materials in a data-driven fashion. 

Specifically, the key contributions seem to be:

- A volume rendering approach to estimate the transfer field and utilize appearance cues to refine the geometry in an end-to-end fashion. This allows optimizing geometry details with appearance cues.

- The framework does not assume a particular material representation (like BRDF or BSSRDF), making it applicable to a wide range of materials with global illumination and subsurface scattering effects. 

- The method produces high quality visual results on real-world objects with significant subsurface scattering captured in a light stage. It compares favorably to prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

- A new light stage dataset of objects with subsurface scattering is collected and will be released to facilitate research in this area. The dataset features high resolution captures with varying lighting.

In summary, the key novelty appears to be the end-to-end volume rendering framework for optimizing radiance transfer fields, which extends neural relighting capabilities to materials with subsurface scattering in a more general and data-driven manner.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for learning radiance transfer fields using volume rendering to enable relighting of objects with subsurface scattering effects and optimizing geometry details end-to-end.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in the field of neural rendering and relighting:

- The key novel contribution is the volume rendering framework for optimizing radiance transfer fields end-to-end to handle subsurface scattering effects. This is different from prior work like NRTF and NeRF which rely on predefined geometry.

- It demonstrates results on challenging real world translucent objects captured in a custom light stage system. This goes beyond a lot of other work that focuses on synthetic data. The light stage dataset is also a valuable contribution.

- The comparisons show quantitative improvements over recent state-of-the-art methods like NRTF and qualitative advantages in handling materials with subsurface scattering. This demonstrates broader applicability than BRDF-based approaches.

- The end-to-end optimization framework allows jointly optimizing geometry and appearance, which is more flexible than separating these steps. This is a useful capability for translucent objects where geometry cues are ambiguous.

- Limitations mentioned include blurry specular highlights and translucent shadows. An interesting direction is incorporating explicit models for these effects. Overall runtime is another aspect that needs improvement for real-time use cases.

- Compared to concurrent work on translucent neural rendering like Yu et al., this method handles complex environment map relighting efficiently. The large-scale light stage data is also a distinguishing factor.

In summary, the volume rendering approach for end-to-end radiance transfer optimization is the key novel contribution over prior neural rendering techniques. The results demonstrate improved performance on translucent materials, thanks to the joint optimization. Releasing the light stage data is also a valuable addition to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the handling of specular highlights and translucent shadows. The authors note limitations in these areas as two main failure modes. They suggest future work could focus on incorporating models to better capture specularities and shadows.

- Increasing rendering speed for real-time applications. The authors state their current approach does not yet meet the demands for real-time rendering. Future work could aim to optimize the model and inference for faster rendering.

- Enabling in-the-wild relighting without a controlled light stage setup. The current method relies on a light stage for capture and training data. The authors suggest adapting the approach for more uncontrolled capture conditions could be an area for future work.

- Exploring more efficient model architectures. The authors mention more efficient models like PlenOctrees or Plenoxels could potentially replace the MLPs used currently. Investigating these types of models could improve efficiency.

- Releasing more high-quality datasets. The authors captured and will release a new light stage dataset to facilitate future research. Collecting and sharing more datasets like this could further advance work in this area.

In summary, the main suggestions are around improving specular and shadow modeling, speed, generalizability, model efficiency, and datasets to push relighting with subsurface scattering forward. The authors lay out these areas as promising avenues for extending their approach in the future.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes a novel framework for learning the radiance transfer field of objects with subsurface scattering effects using volume rendering and optimizing geometry and appearance end-to-end. It extends the capabilities of neural rendering methods like NeRF to handle materials beyond surface reflectance like BRDFs, which is useful for relighting. The key ideas are 1) using volume rendering to learn the radiance transfer gradient instead of just RGB colors like NeRF, 2) refining geometry using appearance cues instead of separating geometry optimization, and 3) not assuming an explicit material model like BRDF or BSSRDF. Experiments on synthetic and real captured data show it can reconstruct translucent objects not handled well by BRDF or BSSRDF methods, with higher quality than the state of the art like NRTF. The method is limited by blurry specularities and shadows, and lacks real-time performance. The paper's novelty is extending neural rendering to broader materials through volume rendering and joint optimization, demonstrated on a new high-quality light stage dataset of translucent objects that will be released.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework for learning the radiance transfer field via volume rendering and utilizing various appearance cues to refine geometry end-to-end. This framework extends relighting and reconstruction capabilities to handle a wider range of materials in a data-driven fashion. The core of the learning framework consists of a volume renderer enabling an end-to-end optimization and density-based neural transfer field networks. Instead of predicting the transfer vector directly, the model predicts the transfer vector gradient, representing the HDR contribution of a segment along a light transmission direction. The color of each pixel ray is computed using volume rendering. The model is optimized using a weighted L2 tonemapped loss on the predicted pixel values. An auxiliary mask loss imposes L2 regularizers on the density of background rays. For environment map conditioning, each envmap pixel is treated as an one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) point light. The median cut algorithm is used to accelerate inference. 

The method is evaluated on synthetic data from the NeRF dataset with original and modified materials with subsurface scattering. It is also evaluated on a newly collected light stage dataset of objects with subsurface scattering. Comparisons are made to recent neural relighting methods using BRDF and BSSRDF representations. The proposed method consistently outperforms on metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS on both synthetic and real data. The results showcase improved fidelity and geometric accuracy. The framework extends relighting capabilities to handle a wider range materials including those with translucency and subsurface scattering without needing an explicit BRDF or BSSRDF model.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for neural relighting that incorporates optimization of shape and radiance transfer using a volume rendering approach. The core of the method is a volume renderer that enables end-to-end optimization of a density-based neural transfer field. The model predicts the gradient of a precomputed radiance transfer vector at each point along a ray, which represents the HDR contribution for that segment under a given lighting direction. This allows relighting under novel lighting, including environment maps, by aggregating the predicted transfer vectors. Compared to prior neural radiance transfer field methods, this approach can be trained from scratch without relying on a pre-estimated surface. It also enables joint optimization of geometry details and relightable appearance. Experiments on synthetic data and a novel real-world light stage capture dataset demonstrate improved reconstruction and rendering over state-of-the-art methods.
