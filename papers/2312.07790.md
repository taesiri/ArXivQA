## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Probabilistic circuits (PCs) have shown promise for tractable inference and density estimation, but have some key limitations:
1) PCs rely on integrating out base measures, which makes a unified treatment of mixed discrete-continuous domains challenging. 
2) PCs cannot easily represent distributions without closed-form densities like alpha-stable distributions.
3) Efficient computation of densities and inference from PCs with complex structure or distributions can still be difficult.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Characteristic Circuits (CCs), which represent joint distributions over mixed discrete-continuous domains through their characteristic function rather than density. Key aspects:

1) Unified discrete-continuous domains: By moving to the spectral domain using characteristic functions, CCs avoid integration and provide a unified representation for any probability distribution independent of its base measure. This enables seamlessly modeling mixed data.

2) Tractability without closed-form densities: Since characteristic functions uniquely specify probability distributions, CCs can represent complex distributions with intractable densities like alpha-stable distributions. Efficient probabilistic computations are still possible directly from the characteristic function.  

3) Efficient density computation: The paper shows how densities and arbitrary marginal distributions can be computed exactly and efficiently from CCs using an extension of Levy's inversion theorem, despite potential complexity of the distribution or model structure.

4) Parameter and structure learning: Efficient algorithms are provided to learn CC parameters by matching to empirical characteristic functions and also to learn CC structure from data using clustering and independence testing.

Contributions:
1) A new model class Characteristic Circuits that provides a unified representation in the spectral domain for discrete, continuous, and mixed distributions. Permits representing complex densities intractable for PCs.

2) Proof that key probabilistic queries like density evaluation and marginal inference remain tractable for CCs.

3) Algorithms for learning CC parameters and structure efficiently from data.

4) Empirical evaluation showing CCs better estimate ground truth over ECFs, and achieve state-of-the-art density estimation on several real-world tabular datasets.
