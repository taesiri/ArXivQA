# [Visual Instruction Tuning with Polite Flamingo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01003)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The key research question addressed in this paper is how to effectively use a diverse collection of annotated vision-language datasets to improve visual understanding capabilities of large language models, while preventing the raw annotations from negatively impacting the response style and politeness of the model. 

To address this, the paper proposes a new method to rewrite the raw annotations from vision-language datasets into more natural and polite responses. It trains a "Polite Flamingo" model as a multi-modal response rewriter, and applies it to convert a large collection of vision-language datasets into high-quality instructional data. This rewritten dataset "PF-1M" is then used to train the final multi-modal model "Clever Flamingo" via a novel U-shaped multi-stage tuning approach.

The central hypothesis is that using the proposed annotation rewriting and multi-stage tuning methodology will allow the model to leverage diverse vision-language data to improve visual understanding, while avoiding the "multi-modal alignment tax" that typically degrades response quality when using raw annotations directly. Experiments verify improved performance on vision-language tasks along with higher human preference ratings.

In summary, the key research question is how to utilize the richness of vision-language datasets for visual instruction tuning, while preventing the model from learning undesired annotation styles that reduce response politeness - and the proposed Polite Flamingo rewriting approach provides a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to mitigate the "multi-modal alignment tax" when using raw vision-language dataset annotations to train multi-modal language models. The key ideas are:

1. Training a "Polite Flamingo" model to rewrite raw annotations into more natural and polite responses, by reconstructing original high-quality responses from distorted versions. 

2. Applying Polite Flamingo to rewrite a large collection of vision-language dataset annotations and constructing a 1M dataset "PF-1M".

3. Proposing techniques like U-shaped multi-stage tuning and multi-turn augmentation to efficiently train the multi-modal model "Clever Flamingo" using PF-1M, without sacrificing response quality.

4. Comprehensive evaluation showing Clever Flamingo achieves strong performance in both multi-modal understanding and response politeness compared to other models.

In summary, the main contribution is developing methods to take advantage of large vision-language datasets for multi-modal model training, while avoiding the common pitfall of degenerated response formatting. The Polite Flamingo rewriter and PF-1M dataset enable mitigating this "multi-modal alignment tax".


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to rewrite raw vision-language dataset annotations into natural and helpful responses to improve multi-modal AI assistants, mitigating the loss of response quality caused by directly using the raw annotations for model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work in training multi-modal AI systems:

The key focus of this paper is mitigating the "multi-modal alignment tax" that emerges when training multi-modal language models using visual datasets with very short/unformatted annotations (like VQA). This causes the model to lose some of its language generation ability and politeness. The paper proposes a novel method to rewrite the responses in visual datasets to make them more natural before using them for training.

Compared to other works:

- LLaVA uses GPT-4 to generate self-instruct data, which is high quality but limited scale and diversity. This paper uses a trained rewriter model for better scalability.

- InstructBLIP and Otter directly use raw visual dataset annotations, suffering from multi-modal alignment tax. 

- M3IT and MIMIC-IT use ChatGPT to rewrite responses. But ChatGPT is text-only, while this paper trains a multi-modal rewriter (Polite Flamingo).

- The rewriter model idea is similar to FuseCap and LaCLIP/RemoteCLIP for image captioning. But this paper focuses on a broader range of visual tasks beyond just captioning.

- The proposed rewriting method and multi-stage tuning provides a scalable way to leverage diverse visual datasets while preserving language quality. Most prior works optimize one or the other.

- Comprehensive analysis is provided comparing the proposed model (Clever Flamingo) against several SoTA models on understanding, generalization, and politeness.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in training multi-modal LLMs by mitigating multi-modal alignment tax through a learned rewriter model and multi-stage tuning. The politeness and broad visual capabilities are strengths compared to prior arts.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Developing methods to further enhance the diversity and scale of high-quality visual instruction tuning data. The paper discusses the need for more diverse and large-scale datasets of detailed image descriptions and captions to prevent overfitting and improve the image captioning capability. 

2. Exploring methods to mitigate the object hallucination problem faced by existing multi-modal LLMs. As shown in Figure 5, all current models exhibit issues with hallucinating non-existent objects. Developing techniques to improve visual grounding could help address this limitation.

3. Iteratively training subsequent generations of Polite Flamingo and Clever Flamingo models to create a weakly supervised loop for incremental improvements. The authors suggest that transferring the improved visual understanding from Clever Flamingo back to Polite Flamingo may further enhance the rewriting capability.

4. Incorporating commonsense knowledge and reasoning into the models, as raw vision-language dataset annotations lack such information. This could improve multi-modal reasoning and pragmatics.

5. Evaluating the models on additional challenging vision-language tasks such as embodied QA. The paper focuses on captioning, VQA and visual reasoning, but evaluating on embodied tasks could reveal other limitations.

In summary, the key future directions are improving the diversity and scale of high-quality tuning data, mitigating hallucination issues, creating a weakly supervised training loop between rewriter and end model, incorporating commonsense reasoning, and evaluating on more complex vision-language tasks. Advancing research in these areas could lead to more capable and practical multi-modal AI assistant systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method to improve the politeness and naturalness of responses from multi-modal vision-language models while retaining their visual understanding capabilities. It proposes training a multi-modal response rewriter called Polite Flamingo on high-quality instruction data to convert raw annotations from vision-language datasets into more natural responses. Polite Flamingo is applied to rewrite numerous dataset annotations, and after careful filtering, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset PF-1M is obtained. Using this dataset along with techniques like U-shaped tuning and multi-turn augmentation, a strong instruction-tuned multi-modal LLM called Clever Flamingo is derived. Evaluations demonstrate Clever Flamingo's advantages in both visual understanding and response politeness compared to models tuned on raw annotations, showing the value of response rewriting in mitigating multi-modal alignment tax.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel method to enable large language models (LLMs) to effectively learn from a diverse collection of vision-language datasets while mitigating issues with response formatting/politeness. The key idea is to train a "Polite Flamingo" model that can rewrite the raw, terse annotations in these datasets into more natural, conversational responses. Polite Flamingo is trained on high-quality instruction datasets to learn this mapping from "impolite" to "polite" responses. It is applied to rewrite numerous vision-language datasets like VQA and captioning corpora. After careful filtering, the resulting dataset (PF-1M) is used to train an LLM called Clever Flamingo.

Experiments demonstrate that Clever Flamingo outperforms prior work on detailed image captioning and multi-image reasoning tasks. It also produces more human-preferred, "polite" responses compared to other multi-modal LLMs, with the exception of models trained purely on expensive GPT-3/4 data. The work provides an effective solution to harness diverse vision-language data while avoiding the typical degradation in response quality ("multi-modal alignment tax"). Core contributions include the Polite Flamingo rewriting model, PF-1M dataset, U-shaped tuning procedure, and comprehensive automated & human evaluations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

The paper proposes Polite Flamingo, a multi-modal response rewriter, to convert raw annotations from vision-language datasets into more natural and polite responses. Polite Flamingo is trained on a surrogate task of reconstructing high-quality responses from distorted versions approximating raw annotations. It learns to integrate visual information and text semantics to produce coherent, detailed responses. The trained Polite Flamingo is applied to rewrite numerous vision-language dataset annotations. After careful filtering, the rewritten data (PF-1M) is used to train Clever Flamingo, a multi-modal LLM. Clever Flamingo employs u-shaped multi-stage tuning focused first on textual instructions, then visual grounding with PF-1M, and finally recovering response quality. Evaluations show Clever Flamingo combines strong visual understanding with high response quality compared to existing methods. The key novelty is using a multi-modal rewriter to convert raw annotations into natural responses for visual instruction tuning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of "multi-modal alignment tax" that emerges when fine-tuning vision-language models on datasets with raw, unformatted annotations. Specifically:

- Multi-task fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) on vision-language datasets improves performance on downstream tasks. 

- However, the raw, unformatted annotations in these datasets cause the LLMs to lose their ability to provide natural, polite responses. This degradation in politeness/formatting ability is termed the "multi-modal alignment tax".

- The paper proposes a method to convert the raw annotations into more natural responses before using them to fine-tune the LLM. This mitigates the multi-modal alignment tax and results in a model that has strong vision-language capabilities but can still provide high-quality, human-friendly responses.

In summary, the key problem is that directly using raw vision-language annotations for multi-modal LLM fine-tuning harms the model's ability to generate polite, properly formatted responses. The paper aims to address this trade-off between visual grounding and response quality.
