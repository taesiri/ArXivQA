# Visual Instruction Tuning with Polite Flamingo

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The key research question addressed in this paper is how to effectively use a diverse collection of annotated vision-language datasets to improve visual understanding capabilities of large language models, while preventing the raw annotations from negatively impacting the response style and politeness of the model. To address this, the paper proposes a new method to rewrite the raw annotations from vision-language datasets into more natural and polite responses. It trains a "Polite Flamingo" model as a multi-modal response rewriter, and applies it to convert a large collection of vision-language datasets into high-quality instructional data. This rewritten dataset "PF-1M" is then used to train the final multi-modal model "Clever Flamingo" via a novel U-shaped multi-stage tuning approach.The central hypothesis is that using the proposed annotation rewriting and multi-stage tuning methodology will allow the model to leverage diverse vision-language data to improve visual understanding, while avoiding the "multi-modal alignment tax" that typically degrades response quality when using raw annotations directly. Experiments verify improved performance on vision-language tasks along with higher human preference ratings.In summary, the key research question is how to utilize the richness of vision-language datasets for visual instruction tuning, while preventing the model from learning undesired annotation styles that reduce response politeness - and the proposed Polite Flamingo rewriting approach provides a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to mitigate the "multi-modal alignment tax" when using raw vision-language dataset annotations to train multi-modal language models. The key ideas are:1. Training a "Polite Flamingo" model to rewrite raw annotations into more natural and polite responses, by reconstructing original high-quality responses from distorted versions. 2. Applying Polite Flamingo to rewrite a large collection of vision-language dataset annotations and constructing a 1M dataset "PF-1M".3. Proposing techniques like U-shaped multi-stage tuning and multi-turn augmentation to efficiently train the multi-modal model "Clever Flamingo" using PF-1M, without sacrificing response quality.4. Comprehensive evaluation showing Clever Flamingo achieves strong performance in both multi-modal understanding and response politeness compared to other models.In summary, the main contribution is developing methods to take advantage of large vision-language datasets for multi-modal model training, while avoiding the common pitfall of degenerated response formatting. The Polite Flamingo rewriter and PF-1M dataset enable mitigating this "multi-modal alignment tax".


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method to rewrite raw vision-language dataset annotations into natural and helpful responses to improve multi-modal AI assistants, mitigating the loss of response quality caused by directly using the raw annotations for model training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related work in training multi-modal AI systems:The key focus of this paper is mitigating the "multi-modal alignment tax" that emerges when training multi-modal language models using visual datasets with very short/unformatted annotations (like VQA). This causes the model to lose some of its language generation ability and politeness. The paper proposes a novel method to rewrite the responses in visual datasets to make them more natural before using them for training.Compared to other works:- LLaVA uses GPT-4 to generate self-instruct data, which is high quality but limited scale and diversity. This paper uses a trained rewriter model for better scalability.- InstructBLIP and Otter directly use raw visual dataset annotations, suffering from multi-modal alignment tax. - M3IT and MIMIC-IT use ChatGPT to rewrite responses. But ChatGPT is text-only, while this paper trains a multi-modal rewriter (Polite Flamingo).- The rewriter model idea is similar to FuseCap and LaCLIP/RemoteCLIP for image captioning. But this paper focuses on a broader range of visual tasks beyond just captioning.- The proposed rewriting method and multi-stage tuning provides a scalable way to leverage diverse visual datasets while preserving language quality. Most prior works optimize one or the other.- Comprehensive analysis is provided comparing the proposed model (Clever Flamingo) against several SoTA models on understanding, generalization, and politeness.In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in training multi-modal LLMs by mitigating multi-modal alignment tax through a learned rewriter model and multi-stage tuning. The politeness and broad visual capabilities are strengths compared to prior arts.
