# [Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, this paper proposes a method called Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. The key research questions/hypotheses appear to be:- Can deep neural networks be used to jointly optimize feature learning and clustering in an unsupervised manner? - Will learning features and cluster assignments simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion improve performance over prior methods?The authors propose DEC to address these questions, which learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space where clustering is iteratively optimized. The hypothesis seems to be that this joint deep learning approach will outperform prior state-of-the-art methods on clustering tasks. The experiments aim to validate if DEC achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to other clustering algorithms on image and text data.In summary, the central research question is whether deep neural networks can be used in an unsupervised manner to simultaneously learn good feature representations and cluster assignments, outperforming existing methods that treat feature learning and clustering separately. The paper proposes and evaluates DEC to test this hypothesis.
