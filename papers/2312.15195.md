# [Mutual Information as Intrinsic Reward of Reinforcement Learning Agents   for On-demand Ride Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15195)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
On-demand ride pooling services like UberPool and LyftLine allow multiple passengers traveling in the same direction to share rides in the same vehicle. This increases driver income and reduces costs for passengers compared to regular taxi services that assign one passenger per vehicle. However, ride pooling requires intelligent algorithms to match passengers and route vehicles. Existing algorithms focus mostly on revenue maximization, which can result in some passenger requests in unusual locations not getting rides. The paper aims to address this issue.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework for vehicle dispatching to maximize long-term revenues while ensuring passengers in unusual locations also get rides. The key ideas are:

- Discretize the city map into hexagonal regions for near-field vehicle dispatching 

- Use mean field Q-learning (MFQL) to scale RL algorithm to city-level problem with thousands of vehicles  

- Add the mutual information (MI) between vehicle and passenger distributions as an intrinsic reward to the RL algorithm. This encourages adjusting vehicle distribution to passenger distribution.

Main Contributions:

- Precisely defines the dispatching and matching problem for ride pooling 

- Proposes near-field dispatching framework with MFQL to scale to city-level problems

- Uses MI between vehicle and passenger distributions as intrinsic reward for RL algorithm to improve correlation between their distributions

- Achieves 3% higher revenues over state-of-the-art on-demand ride pooling method on real-world dataset while ensuring passengers in unusual locations also get rides

In summary, the paper presents an RL-based regional dispatching framework for on-demand ride pooling that uses MI between vehicle and passenger distributions to maximize long-term revenues while balancing supply and demand.
