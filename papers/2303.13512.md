# [Towards Solving Fuzzy Tasks with Human Feedback: A Retrospective of the   MineRL BASALT 2022 Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13512)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop algorithms and techniques to fine-tune large foundation models using human feedback in order to solve tasks that are difficult to specify with a reward function?

The paper describes the MineRL BASALT competition, which was designed to encourage research progress on developing methods for fine-tuning foundation models using human feedback. The tasks in the competition are designed to be challenging to specify precisely with a reward function, so competitors need to leverage human feedback channels to learn the desired behavior. 

The paper provides an overview of the competition, including the task design, resources provided, rules, and evaluation methodology. It then summarizes the approaches taken by the winning teams, which combined imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and human feedback.

The key hypothesis seems to be that by holding this competition focused specifically on fine-tuning foundation models from human feedback on hard-to-specify sequential decision making tasks, it will promote research progress on developing new algorithms and techniques for this problem setting. The paper aims to provide an overview of the competition and top solutions to assess whether the competition achieved this goal.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop techniques to fine-tune large foundation models using various forms of human feedback in order to accomplish fuzzy, hard-to-specify tasks, and the paper describes a competition designed to encourage progress in this direction.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of learning from human feedback:

- The use of Minecraft as a testbed for learning from human feedback is relatively novel. Most prior work has focused on more constrained or simulated environments. Using Minecraft introduces new challenges like partially observable states and a high-dimensional visual observation space.

- Fine-tuning a large pre-trained vision model (VPT) with human feedback is an interesting approach that leverages recent advances in representation learning. Many prior methods do not make use of pre-trained features. Comparing to simpler behavioral cloning baselines helps demonstrate the benefits of this modeling choice.

- The paper introduces tasks that purposefully lack an easy-to-define reward function. This emphasizes the role of human feedback for specifying complex objectives. Many prior papers use human feedback to optimize a proxy reward function that is easier to specify programmatically.

- The competition format helped engage many researchers and led to a diversity of solutions. Comparing multiple methods helps better evaluate the state-of-the-art. The competition also specifies a rigorous evaluation protocol using human assessors.

- One limitation is that most methods rely on offline human feedback from demonstrations during training. Online interaction during evaluation could better demonstrate generalization. The KAIROS method does incorporate some online feedback.

- While Minecraft presents a more realistic setting than simple games, it may still fall short of capturing challenges of real-world deployment like safety considerations. Evaluating on real-world robotics tasks could be an interesting direction for future work.

Overall, the competition format, novel environment, and focus on pre-trained models help push research in learning from human feedback forwards. The results help highlight strengths and limitations of current methods, while pointing towards interesting open problems for future work. The paper makes a nice contribution to characterizing the state-of-the-art in this emerging field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more advanced techniques for fine-tuning foundation models from human feedback. The paper notes that this competition was a first attempt at this, so there is much room for improvement. Some specific ideas include developing algorithms that more efficiently incorporate human feedback and experimenting with different modalities of human feedback beyond pairwise preferences.

- Designing tasks and environments to better test fine-tuning capabilities. The authors suggest providing participants with a diverse set of strong baselines to build off of. They also recommend designing tasks that encourage solutions to closely adhere to the intent of fine-tuning from human feedback. Environments like Minecraft provide a flexible testbed for creating such tasks.

- Improving the competition evaluation methodology. The paper discusses balancing objective leaderboard metrics versus rewarding interesting solutions that may score lower. Ideas include treating competition tracks more like conference research tracks and providing separate prizes for research contributions.

- Expanding the properties and capabilities that can be incorporated via human feedback. The long-term vision is to enable incorporating complex objectives like ethics and aesthetics.

- Applying fine-tuning techniques to train large foundation models for real-world tasks without formal reward functions. The authors motivate the competition as a step towards enabling these practical applications.

Overall, the paper emphasizes that this competition made good progress but there remain many open challenges and room for innovation in research on fine-tuning foundation models from human feedback. The competition serves as a starting point to drive further work in this direction.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents the MineRL BASALT competition held at NeurIPS 2022, which focused on developing algorithms for fine-tuning foundation models with human feedback to solve tasks with hard-to-specify reward functions. The competition used four challenging open-world tasks in Minecraft that required agents to explore, build structures, and interact with the environment without explicit rewards. Participants leveraged a large pre-trained video prediction model and human feedback through demonstrations and preferences to develop solutions. The competition saw high participation, with over 60 teams and 500 submissions. The top solutions combined imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and scripted behaviors. The winners utilized techniques like searching demonstration trajectories for similar states and learning reward models from preferences. The competition successfully encouraged the development of fine-tuning techniques for sequential decision making without formal task specifications. Key outcomes were increased participation over the first iteration in 2021 and improved performance on the tasks. Future directions include better aligning the competition intent and evaluation, providing participants with strong baselines, and developing more creative tasks.
