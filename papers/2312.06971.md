# [CCM: Adding Conditional Controls to Text-to-Image Consistency Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06971)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper explores strategies for adding conditional control capabilities to text-to-image consistency models (CMs). The authors first try directly applying a pre-trained ControlNet from a diffusion model (DM) to a CM. While this transfers high-level semantic control, it struggles with low-level details and realism. Next, they treat the CM as its own generative model and train a ControlNet from scratch using consistency training. This allows successfully training customized control for CMs without reliance on DMs. Finally, to leverage DM ControlNets while mitigating the gap between CMs and DMs, they propose training a lightweight adapter module using consistency training. Experiments across various conditions show suboptimal performance directly applying DM ControlNets, better results training from scratch with consistency training, and promise from the adapter approach in rapidly transferring multiple DM ControlNets. The key findings are: 1) DM ControlNets transfer high-level control to CMs but fail on fine details 2) Consistency training allows training CM ControlNets from scratch 3) A shared adapter facilitates swift transfer of multiple DM ControlNets.
