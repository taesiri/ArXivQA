# [Multi-dimensional Evaluation of Empathetic Dialog Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11409)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Evaluating empathy in conversations is important but prior work has limitations: focuses only on expressed empathy from the speaker's perspective, ignores perceived empathy from the listener's perspective. 
- Existing frameworks lack a multi-dimensional view covering both expressed and perceived empathy.

Proposed Solution
- The paper proposes a novel multi-dimensional framework to evaluate conversational empathy along two dimensions:
   1) Expressed empathy: predicts specific communicative intents used by the speaker to express empathy
   2) Perceived empathy: predicts if the listener perceives the utterance as empathetic across four aspects (engagement, understanding, sympathy, helpfulness)

- The framework is applied to analyze an internal customer service dialogue dataset. Results show the two dimensions are interconnected and perceived empathy correlates with dialogue satisfaction.  

- To scale up evaluation without excessive labeled data reliance, the paper explores automatically measuring empathy via:
   1) Prompting frozen large language models (LLMs) 
   2) Training classifier models with instruction tuning

Key Contributions  
- Novel multi-dimensional framework to evaluate conversational empathy covering both expressed and perceived empathy
- Analysis validating the proposed framework on real-world customer service dialogues
- Extensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art models and techniques for automatic empathy measurement
- Best empathy classification performance achieved using instruction-tuned classifiers based on sequence-to-sequence LMs
- Reveals challenges for LLMs in empathy understanding via prompting tests
- Provides recommendations on adopting empathetic dialogue evaluation metrics

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in conversational empathy analysis and automatic measurement by proposing and validating a comprehensive evaluation framework, and rigorously examining various modeling techniques. The results provide useful insights and guidelines for empathy-aware dialogue systems.
