# [Multi-Energy Guided Image Translation with Stochastic Differential   Equations for Near-Infrared Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05908)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Facial expression recognition (FER) under extreme lighting conditions is still an open challenge. Visible (VIS) sensors struggle to capture high-quality facial images in low light. Near-infrared (NIR) imaging provides an effective solution but directly applying VIS FER methods to NIR data is ineffective due to:
1) Insufficient NIR training data 
2) Large modality discrepancy between VIS and NIR facial images

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes NFER-SDE, the first approach to transform VIS facial expression appearance to NIR to tackle the overfitting problem on small NIR datasets. NFER-SDE takes the whole VIS image as input and guides the preservation of modality-invariant information in the high-frequency facial image content. The main components are:

1) Energy functions for task-specific guidance:
   - Landmark-based energy function to preserve facial structure crucial for FER
   - Frequency-based energy function to preserve high-freq content using domain knowledge of NIR-VIS expression translation
       
2) Conditional score matching network:
   - Conditions the score network on VIS input image to focus on subtle expression details 

Main Contributions:

1) First effort to synthesize NIR expression images from VIS for improved NIR facial expression recognition

2) Novel task-specific energy functions to guide image generation using facial expression domain knowledge 

3) Conditional score matching network to preserve expression details from VIS input

4) State-of-the-art performance on NIR datasets Oulu-CASIA and Large-HFE, significantly improving NIR facial expression recognition

The proposed NFER-SDE framework effectively translates VIS to NIR facial expressions, preserving crucial details and structure for recognition. Conditioning the score network and guiding via expression-specific energies helps tackle overfitting on small NIR datasets.
