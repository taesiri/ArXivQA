# [APoLLo: Unified Adapter and Prompt Learning for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01564)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents APoLLo, a novel unified approach for adapter and prompt learning in vision-language models like CLIP to improve their generalization capability in few-shot settings. The key ideas include: 1) Introducing trainable adapter layers in both image and text encoders that are coupled via cross-attention to align the modalities. 2) Employing contrastive consistency losses between augmented image/text branches to prevent overfitting. 3) Using descriptive text generation by LLMs and text-conditional diffusion models to create effective multi-modal augmentations. 4) Experimental evaluation on diverse recognition tasks involving novel classes, cross-dataset analysis, and domain shifts demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant gains over prior arts, highlighting the efficacy of unifying adapter tuning and prompt learning in a multi-modal framework augmented using generative models. The ablation studies also confirm the utility of individual components in APoLLo towards achieving improved generalization.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes APoLLo, which is the first method that combines adapter and prompt tuning for vision-language pretraining (VLP) models like CLIP in a unified manner. This allows learning new tasks with few shots without compromising the model's zero-shot generalizability.

2) It introduces a novel multi-modal augmentation strategy using language models to generate descriptive texts and text-conditioned diffusion models to generate image augmentations. 

3) It applies novel multi-modal cross-attention adapter layers to bridge the gap between vision and language modalities by generating text-guided visual features and vice-versa, promoting synergy.

4) Extensive experiments on 10 datasets show APoLLo outperforms existing methods significantly and sets a new state-of-the-art for tasks like base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset recognition, and unseen domain shifts.

In summary, the main contribution is a unified adapter and prompt learning approach called APoLLo that leverages novel augmentation strategies and cross-modal interactions to substantially improve few-shot learning for vision-language models without compromising their generalization capability.
