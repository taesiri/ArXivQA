## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision-language pretraining (VLP) models like CLIP demonstrate strong zero-shot performance but are difficult to fine-tune for few-shot downstream tasks due to their massive scale and scarce training data. Recent methods have used prompting or adapter tuning to address this, but they can lead to overfitting or forgetting useful knowledge gained during pretraining. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes APoLLo, a unified framework that combines adapter and prompt learning to improve VLP model generalization under few-shot fine-tuning. The key ideas are:

1) Novel image and text prompting strategy with shared prompts across transformer layers to capture correlated features.

2) Input augmentation using LLMs to generate descriptive texts and text-conditional diffusion for visually-consistent images.

3) Cross-attention based adapter layers to align image and text modalities.

4) Consistency-based contrastive loss between augmented and original modalities to prevent overfitting.

Main Contributions:

1) First method to unify adapter and prompt tuning for VLP models in a multi-modal manner. Achieves few-shot learning without compromising zero-shot performance.

2) Novel multi-modal augmentation strategy using LLMs and diffusion models. 

3) Cross-modal adapter layers with attention improve alignment between modalities.

4) Outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin on few-shot recognition over 10 datasets, seen as up to 6.03% relative gain. Strong generalization for novel classes, cross-dataset and domain shift scenarios.

In summary, APoLLo advances VLP fine-tuning through a unified adapter and prompting approach augmented with cross-attention and contrastive consistency losses. Both quantitative and qualitative results validate its effectiveness for few-shot generalization.
