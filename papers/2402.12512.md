# [Learning Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions for Guaranteed   Safety of Car-Like Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12512)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of designing a robust safety filter for car-like robots with steering constraints moving in complex environments. Specifically, it is difficult in practice to explicitly calculate a valid Input Constrained Control Barrier Function (ICCBF) which is required to guarantee safety using overriding control. This difficulty arises due to:

1) The complexity of characterizing safe vs unsafe regions for car-like robots with constraints on both position and steering angle/rate. 

2) The need for the ICCBF to be smooth and high-order differentiable, which is not satisfied by common map representations that characterize obstacles.

3) The computational complexity of minimizing over the constraints during ICCBF construction.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an approach to learn a smooth ICCBF from data as follows:

1) Approximate the Euclidean Distance Function to obstacles using ε-SVM regression. This results in a smooth surrogate that provides safety guarantees if approximations are sufficiently accurate.

2) Introduce a robustness parameter β to account for uncertainties and further guarantee safety.

3) Reformulate the car model to only have input constraints on the steering rate. This allows efficient ICCBF computation.

4) Vectorize computations of ICCBF gradients for efficient implementation on robot hardware.

Main Contributions:
The main contributions are:

1) A method to learn from data a valid ICCBF for high relative degree systems with input constraints. This is a challenging problem in practice.

2) Consideration of all details required for real-world implementation including reformulation of dynamics and vectorized gradients for computational efficiency.

3) Experimental validation on a modified RC car that shows the approach successfully keeps the car safe on a complex track using overriding control based on the learned ICCBF.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive data-driven approach for ICCBF based safe control that bridges the gap between theory and experimental validation for car-like robots with constraints.
