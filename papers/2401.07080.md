# [GoMatching: A Simple Baseline for Video Text Spotting via Long and Short   Term Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07080)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies two main limitations of current state-of-the-art video text spotting (VTS) methods: 1) The text spotting ability, especially the recognition capability, is inferior compared to image text spotting (ITS) methods. Experiments show there is a substantial gap between the VTS model's spotting and detection-only performance, indicating recognition is the main bottleneck. 2) Most VTS methods rely on region-of-interest (RoI) features or cropping for recognition, ignoring the recent progress in query-based spotters in ITS. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a simple yet strong baseline called GoMatching, which utilizes an off-the-shelf query-based ITS model (DeepSolo) and focuses training on a customized tracker. It introduces two main designs:

1) A rescoring mechanism to adapt DeepSolo to video data by re-calibrating the confidence scores using a lightweight trainable head.

2) A Long-Short Term Matching module (LST-Matcher) which combines a short-term (between adjacent frames) and a long-term matcher (leveraging historical frames) based on Transformer to associate text instances into trajectories.

Main Contributions:

1) Identifies the limitations of recognition capability and reliance on RoI features in state-of-the-art VTS methods.

2) Proposes a simple yet effective baseline that relies on an unchanged image text spotter and strong customized tracker, saving considerable training cost.

3) Introduces rescoring mechanism and LST-Matcher to efficiently adapt the image text spotter to video and empower tracking. 

4) Establishes a new test set ArTVideo for arbitrary-shaped text in video to facilitate more rigorous evaluation.

5) Experiments show superior performance over previous state-of-the-art with lower training budgets. The code and models will be released.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 GoMatching proposes a simple yet effective video text spotting baseline by leveraging an off-the-shelf image text spotter and designing a lightweight tracker via long-short term matching.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are four-fold:

1. It identifies the limitations in current video text spotting (VTS) methods, including unsatisfactory text spotting performance compared to image text spotting (ITS) models, especially on the recognition part. 

2. It proposes a novel and simple baseline called GoMatching, which leverages an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art ITS model and focuses the training efforts on a customized tracker to adapt ITS models to VTS.

3. It introduces a rescoring mechanism and long-short term matching module to adapt the ITS model to video datasets and enhance the tracker's capabilities.

4. It establishes a new test set called ArTVideo to address the absence of curved text in current VTS datasets and evaluate performance on videos with arbitrary-shaped text.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the GoMatching baseline to effectively adapt ITS models for VTS while achieving state-of-the-art performance with less training cost. The rescoring mechanism, matching module, and ArTVideo dataset are introduced to facilitate this goal.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Video text spotting (VTS) - The task of simultaneously detecting, recognizing, and tracking text in videos.

- Image text spotting (ITS) - The task of detecting and recognizing text in individual images. The paper utilizes a state-of-the-art ITS model called DeepSolo.

- Optimization conflict - The issue that jointly optimizing for multiple objectives like detection and tracking can lead to sub-optimal solutions. The paper avoids this by freezing the ITS model and focusing training on the tracking component.  

- Query-based detection - Using a set of learned queries to perform detection, as opposed to region proposal methods. The frozen ITS model DeepSolo is query-based.

- Rescoring mechanism - A method introduced in the paper to adapt DeepSolo to the video domain by adding a small trainable scoring head and fusing its outputs with the base model.

- Long-short term matching (LST-Matcher) - The tracking module proposed in the paper, containing separate short-term and long-term matching components to leverage both adjacent and historical frame information.

- ArTVideo - A new test set introduced containing curved and arbitrary-shaped text to evaluate generalization of models to more complex scenarios.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that video text spotting presents an augmented challenge compared to image text spotting due to the additional tracking task. Can you elaborate on the specific challenges that tracking poses in the context of video text spotting?

2. The paper proposes a simple baseline called GoMatching. Can you explain in detail the architecture of GoMatching, specifically discussing the image text spotter used, the rescoring mechanism, and the long-short term matching module? 

3. The rescoring mechanism in GoMatching consists of a rescoring head and a score fusion operation. What is the motivation behind this design? How does it help mitigate performance degradation caused by the image-video domain gap?

4. The long-short term matching (LST-Matcher) module utilizes both a short term matcher (ST-Matcher) and a long term matcher (LT-Matcher). What are the advantages of using both short and long term information for association? 

5. During inference, the paper mentions a two-stage association process using both the ST-Matcher and LT-Matcher sequentially. Can you walk through this process in detail and explain the rationale?  

6. The loss function consists of a rescoring loss and a long-short association loss. What does each loss term try to optimize and how are they formulated?

7. The paper highlights optimization conflict as an issue in recent video text spotting methods based on the MOTR paradigm. How does GoMatching avoid this issue by using a frozen image text spotter and focusing training on the tracker?

8. The ArTVideo dataset introduced in the paper contains 30% curved text to address the lack of arbitrary shaped text in existing datasets. What unique challenges does curved text introduce? How does GoMatching perform on this dataset?

9. The paper shows GoMatching can match the performance of state-of-the-art methods while requiring much lower training budgets. What specifically contributes to the efficiency of GoMatching in terms of model architecture and training procedure?  

10. The query-based matching approach in GoMatching sets it apart from ROI-based video text spotters. What are the limitations of ROI-based methods? And what advantages can a query-based formulation provide?
