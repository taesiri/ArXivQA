# [Evaluating Perceptual Distances by Fitting Binomial Distributions to   Two-Alternative Forced Choice Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiments are commonly used in visual perception research to understand how humans perceive distances between a reference image and two distorted versions. 
- Typically these involve gathering human judgements on randomly chosen image triplets.
- Evaluating how well a perceptual distance metric correlates with these judgements is difficult, as most metrics reduce the judgements to a binary decision, ignoring factors like the number of judgements per triplet.

Proposed Solution:
- Model the decision process in 2AFC experiments as a binomial distribution, where the probability of choosing one image depends on the perceptual distances calculated by a metric.
- Use maximum likelihood estimation to fit a smooth binomial distribution to empirical judgements conditioned on pairs of distances.
- Allows modeling judgements with different numbers per triplet and evaluating likelihood of human decisions.

Key Contributions:
- Assumes an underlying binomial model for decisions in 2AFC experiments based on perceptual distances. 
- Marginally transforms distance pairs to be uniform then estimates conditional binomial distribution with Gaussian smoothing.
- Calculates maximum likelihood estimate of success probability given distance pairs.
- Evaluates candidate metrics on 2AFC datasets based on judgement agreement and negative log likelihoods.
- Provides more nuanced evaluation than simply percent of agreeing decisions, accounts for judgement counts.
- Method is robust and simple to implement for evaluating distances on 2AFC data.

In summary, the key idea is to model the decision process in 2AFC experiments as a binomial distribution parameterized by perceptual distances in order to better evaluate distance metrics compared to common evaluation practices. The proposed method provides additional insights compared to simply calculating the percentage of agreeing decisions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a statistical method to model human perceptual judgements in two-alternative forced choice experiments as a binomial distribution conditioned on perceptual distances between images, in order to evaluate how well different perceptual distance metrics fit the empirical data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to model the decision-making process in two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) perceptual experiments using a binomial distribution. Specifically:

- They model the probability that a human observer will choose one distorted image over another as a function of the perceptual distances between those distorted images and the reference image. This allows fitting a smooth function to relate distances to choice probabilities.

- They use maximum likelihood estimation to fit the parameters of a binomial distribution to the human judgement data, imposing consistency and smoothness. This allows them to evaluate different numbers of judgements per triplet and calculate metrics like the likelihood of human judgements.

- They apply the method to evaluate several perceptual distance metrics on the BAPPS and CLIC datasets. The method provides more nuanced evaluation than just forcing decisions to binary, and has advantages over prior neural network approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is a probabilistic modelling approach to analyse human judgements in 2AFC experiments, providing more detailed evaluation of perceptual distances than prior approaches.

The paper presents a method for modeling human judgements in 2AFC perceptual experiments using binomial distributions and maximum likelihood estimation.

The key application area is modelling human visual perception based on perceptual datasets gathered through psychophysics experiments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes modelling the perceptual judgements as a weighted coin toss using a binomial distribution. What are the assumptions behind modelling it this way? What other probability distributions could have potentially been used?

2. The paper uses marginal uniformisation to transform the candidate distance pairs $\{d_0, d_1\}$ to be approximately uniform. Why is this an important step before estimating the probability densities? How does it affect the consistency of the estimates?

3. Explain in detail the maximum likelihood estimation process used to fit the binomial distribution parameters to the empirical judgements data. What is being maximised and why? 

4. What are the advantages of modelling the decision process during 2AFC experiments compared to simply forcing a binary decision as done in prior works? How does it allow uncertainty in judgements to be accounted for?

5. The paper proposes several evaluation metrics like agreement of judgements and negative log-likelihoods. Explain these metrics and their usefulness in evaluating model fit. How do they differ from the commonly used 2AFC score?

6. Analyze the decision surface visualizations shown in Fig. 5. What inferences can you draw about the different distance metrics based on their uncertainty regions and diagonal separation?

7. The method relies on two key hyperparameters - kernel width for smoothing and grid size. Explain how the choice of these impact the probability density estimates. How robust is the method to different hyperparameter values?

8. What are some limitations of the proposed approach in terms of the dataset requirements and gathering process? For what types of datasets would it be infeasible to apply this method?

9. The results show superior performance by deep learning based distances over traditional metrics. Analyze potential reasons for this improved correlation with human judgements. 

10. Suggest some extensions or modifications to the proposed method, either to improve performance, expand applicability or combine it with other techniques.
