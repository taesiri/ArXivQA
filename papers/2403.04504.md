# [Improving Matrix Completion by Exploiting Rating Ordinality in Graph   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Matrix completion is an important problem in recommender systems, where the goal is to predict missing entries in a user-item rating matrix based on observed ratings. 
- Recent methods have used graph neural networks (GNNs) by viewing the rating matrix as a user-item bipartite graph and propagating representations to enrich node embeddings.
- However, existing GNN-based methods treat each rating type independently and fail to sufficiently consider the ordinal nature of ratings (i.e. higher ratings imply stronger user preferences). This limits their effectiveness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called ROGMC that exploits rating ordinality in GNN-based matrix completion.
- It converts the bipartite graph into a set of subgraphs, where each subgraph contains edges with ratings greater than or equal to a threshold. This allows for considering multiple views based on rating ordinality.
- GNN is applied to each subgraph and node representations are aggregated. This cumulative preference propagation emphasizes users' stronger preferences based on inherent order of ratings.  
- An interest regularization is introduced to facilitate preference learning from sparse subgraphs by making their representations share an underlying interest semantic captured from all user-item interactions.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore exploiting rating ordinality for GNN-based matrix completion.
- Introduces cumulative preference propagation to emphasize users' stronger preferences based on rating ordinality.
- Proposes interest regularization to handle sparsity and assist preference learning using underlying interest semantics.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods that treat each rating independently on three datasets, with more significant gains when training ratings are limited.
- Provides analysis showing proposed approach better encodes rating ordinality compared to existing strategies.

In summary, the key idea is to directly leverage rating ordinality in GNN message passing rather than treating ratings independently. The paper shows the feasibility and benefits of this new direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new graph neural network-based matrix completion method called ROGMC that exploits rating ordinality by converting the rating matrix into multiple subgraphs based on rating thresholds and introducing interest regularization to address sparsity, outperforming methods that treat ratings as independent relations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new method called ROGMC (Rating Ordinality in Graph Neural Network-based Matrix Completion) to exploit rating ordinality for graph neural network (GNN)-based matrix completion. Specifically:

- It introduces cumulative preference propagation to directly incorporate rating ordinality in GNN's message passing, allowing for users' stronger preferences to be more emphasized based on inherent orders of rating types. 

- It proposes interest regularization to facilitate preference learning using the underlying interest information that exists regardless of the rating types.

- Extensive experiments show that ROGMC consistently outperforms existing strategies of using rating types for GNN, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing rating ordinality. 

In summary, the key contribution is exploring and showing the feasibility of leveraging rating ordinality in GNN for matrix completion, which has not been well studied before. The paper proposes a novel method ROGMC to achieve this and validates its effectiveness.

 Based on my reading of the paper content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper are:

- Matrix completion
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) 
- Rating prediction
- Rating ordinality
- Cumulative preference propagation
- Interest regularization
- Message passing
- Bipartite graphs
- Recommender systems

The paper explores using graph neural networks for the matrix completion problem in recommender systems. A key contribution is proposing a method called "ROGMC" to leverage rating ordinality, which refers to the inherent ordering of rating values (e.g. 1 star to 5 stars). The key components of ROGMC are cumulative preference propagation and interest regularization. The goal is to better capture user preferences based on rating orders compared to prior GNN methods that treat each rating independently. Overall, the paper focuses on recommendation and matrix completion using graph neural networks, with a novel way to consider rating ordinality.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing the ROGMC method? Why does exploiting rating ordinality help improve matrix completion performance?

2. How does the cumulative preference propagation component of ROGMC work? Explain in detail how it converts the bipartite graph into subgraphs and propagates representations over them. 

3. What is the purpose of the interest regularization component in ROGMC? How does it assist in preference learning from the rating subgraphs?

4. How does ROGMC leverage both the rating prediction loss and pairwise ranking loss during model training? What is the intuition behind using both losses together?

5. What are the key differences between how ROGMC handles rating types versus existing GNN-based matrix completion methods like GCMC and RGCN? 

6. Based on the experimental results, why does ROGMC achieve substantially larger improvements over baselines when fewer ratings are available in the training data?

7. What do the ablation studies show about the necessity and validity of the cumulative preference propagation and interest regularization components?

8. How does Figure 3 provide evidence that ROGMC better encodes rating ordinality in its learned representations compared to GCMC+?

9. How might the performance and applicability of ROGMC differ on extremely large, web-scale recommendation datasets? What challenges need to be addressed?

10. What ideas does this paper provide for future work on exploiting rating ordinality in other recommendation and graph learning tasks beyond matrix completion?
