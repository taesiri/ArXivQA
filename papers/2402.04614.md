# [Faithfulness vs. Plausibility: On the (Un)Reliability of Explanations   from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate plausible and coherent self-explanations to explain their predictions, but there is little understanding of whether these explanations faithfully represent the actual reasoning process of the models. This gap between plausibility and faithfulness is concerning, especially for deploying LLMs to high-stakes applications like healthcare where incorrect explanations could have severe consequences.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper argues for the need to enhance both the plausibility and faithfulness of LLM-generated self-explanations. It defines plausibility as how convincing/logical an explanation is to humans and faithfulness as how accurately an explanation reflects the model's reasoning.

- The paper shows how current LLMs overemphasize plausibility due to their training objectives and lack of agreed-upon metrics to evaluate explanation faithfulness.  

- It discusses implications of prioritizing either property alone - plausible but unfaithful explanations foster misplaced trust while faithful but implausible ones reduce model usability.

- The desirability of plausibility vs faithfulness is application-dependent. High-stakes domains require high faithfulness whereas interactive applications prioritize plausibility.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the notions of plausibility and faithfulness of LLM-generated self-explanations.
- Highlights the gap between plausibility and faithfulness in current LLMs. 
- Discusses implications of both properties and why certain applications require specific priorities.
- Provides guidance for future research - developing faithfulness evaluation metrics and methods to enhance faithfulness without compromising plausibility.
- Urges community to recognize faithfulness requirements of real-world applications and meet those needs.

In summary, the paper thoughtfully analyzes self-explanations from LLMs using the lens of plausibility and faithfulness, providing valuable insights and future directions to ensure reliability of LLM-explanations for safe deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper discusses the dichotomy between plausibility (logical coherence of explanations to humans) and faithfulness (accuracy of explanations representing models' reasoning) of self-explanations from large language models, arguing that faithfulness is critical for high-stakes applications while plausibility matters more for user-facing tasks, and calling for advances in assessing and enhancing both properties.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is highlighting the dichotomy between plausibility and faithfulness of self-explanations from large language models (LLMs), and arguing that the community should prioritize developing methodologies to enhance the faithfulness of explanations without compromising their plausibility. 

Specifically, the key points made are:

- Defining plausibility and faithfulness of explanations, where plausibility refers to how convincing/coherent an explanation is to humans while faithfulness refers to how accurately an explanation represents the actual reasoning process of the LLM.

- Discussing how currently LLMs are adept at generating plausible but potentially unfaithful explanations, which could lead to issues like over-reliance and security concerns especially in high-stakes applications.

- Arguing that the choice between prioritizing plausibility or faithfulness is use-case driven based on the application, where high-stakes domains require high faithfulness while interactive domains prioritize plausibility. 

- Issuing a call to action for the community to develop methodologies that can enhance the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations without compromising their plausibility through approaches like fine-tuning, in-context learning, and mechanistic interpretability.

So in summary, the key contribution is highlighting this important dichotomy between plausibility and faithfulness of LLM explanations, discussing associated challenges and implications, and urging more research into improving faithfulness while retaining plausibility.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses the dichotomy between plausibility and faithfulness of explanations from large language models (LLMs). Could you elaborate on why achieving both properties simultaneously is challenging? What are some of the key reasons that make LLMs gravitate more towards plausible rather than faithful explanations?

2. The paper argues that plausibility and faithfulness requirements are application-dependent. Could you discuss this idea further - why do certain applications like healthcare demand high faithfulness while applications like education prioritize plausibility? Provide some specific examples to illustrate your point. 

3. One method proposed to enhance faithfulness is fine-tuning approaches. What are some ways this could be implemented? What kinds of datasets could be leveraged and what fine-tuning techniques show promise for improving faithfulness of LLM explanations?

4. The paper discusses in-context learning (ICL) as another potential technique. How exactly could careful prompt design guide LLMs to generate more faithful explanations? What are some best practices around prompt engineering that could be effective? 

5. Mechanistic interpretability is also suggested - could you explain this idea further? How can dissecting and mapping components of an LLM's architecture lead to more transparent and faithful explanations?

6. For high-stakes applications demanding faithful explanations, what are some priority areas and specific use cases the community should focus on? Why are these so crucial?

7. For interactive applications where plausibility matters more, what kinds of novel explanation strategies could be explored? How can we balance retaining faithfulness while improving engagement?

8. The paper argues optimism around the ability for faithfulness and plausibility to co-exist in LLM explanations. Do you agree? What are the biggest bottlenecks and why do you think they can or cannot be resolved?

9. How can the notion of faithfulness be standardized across applications and models? What kinds of benchmarks and quantitative metrics could be developed?

10. What do you see as the most promising direction for future work? Between architectural innovations, training paradigms, evaluation methodologies - where should the community be focusing efforts?
