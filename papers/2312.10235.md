# [Building symmetries into data-driven manifold dynamics models for   complex flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Building accurate data-driven models of complex fluid flows is challenging. A key opportunity to improve such models lies in exploiting symmetries of the underlying dynamics. The Navier-Stokes equations exhibit both continuous (e.g. translation) and discrete (e.g. rotation, reflection) symmetries, which lead to symmetries in the dynamics. Properly accounting for these can yield more efficient and accurate reduced-order models. Prior works have not fully exploited these symmetries.  

Proposed Solution - "Symmetry Charting":
The authors introduce a method called "symmetry charting" to build low-dimensional data-driven models that exploit symmetries. The key ideas are:

1) Map data to a "fundamental chart" where discrete symmetries are factored out using symmetry indicators. This leads to dense sampling that improves modeling. 

2) Use an autoencoder variant called IRMAE-WD to find a minimal coordinate representation of the fundamental chart. This gives a robust estimate of the dimension of the invariant manifold where the dynamics live.

3) Learn a time-evolution model on the latent coordinates using Neural ODEs. The model is trained only on the fundamental chart but can be applied to any chart by tracking discrete symmetries. This guarantees equivariance.  

4) Evolve both the pattern coordinates and symmetry indicators like phase to capture the full state dynamics. Discretely symmetric charts are connected via transition maps.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of "symmetry charting" to exploit symmetries in data-driven modeling of fluid flows

- Demonstration of dramatically improved model performance in terms of data efficiency, equivariance, short and long-term accuracy

- Rigorous accounting for both continuous and discrete symmetries 

- Estimation of dimensionality of invariant manifold from data

- Framework to learn across multiple charts related by symmetries

The methods are demonstrated on chaotic Kolmogorov flow, leading to low-dimensional models that properly capture symmetries, statistics, and complex bursting dynamics using far less data than prior methods.
