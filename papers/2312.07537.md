# [FreeInit: Bridging Initialization Gap in Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07537)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper identifies and addresses a discrepancy in the noise initialization between training and inference of video diffusion models, which causes unsatisfactory temporal consistency in generated videos. Specifically, during training, the diffusion process is unable to fully corrupt the latent representations into pure noise, resulting in leaked low-frequency signals. However at inference, the model starts denoising from pure Gaussian noise which lacks such correlations. To bridge this gap, the authors propose FreeInit - an inference strategy which iteratively refines the spatial-temporal low-frequency components of the initial noise without additional training. This is achieved by combining the low-frequencies of a forward-diffused latent with high-frequencies from random noise. Experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FreeInit consistently improves coherence in generated videos. The method introduces no extra parameters and can be readily applied at inference time. Both quantitative metrics and user studies confirm the effectiveness of FreeInit in enhancing visual quality and temporal consistency.
