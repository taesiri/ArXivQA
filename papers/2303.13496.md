# [The effectiveness of MAE pre-pretraining for billion-scale pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13496)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How effective is using MAE pre-pretraining to initialize models before large-scale weakly supervised pretraining with billions of images?The key hypothesis that the paper investigates is that adding an initial pre-pretraining stage with MAE before the standard weakly supervised pretraining will improve the performance and efficiency of the resulting models. Specifically, the paper examines:- Whether MAE pre-pretraining helps with model convergence and downstream task performance when used to initialize models before pretraining on billions of weakly labeled images.- If the improvements from MAE pre-pretraining hold for different model sizes (from millions to billions of parameters) and different pretraining dataset sizes (from millions to billions of images).- Whether MAE pre-pretraining helps combine the benefits of self-supervised learning (with MAE) and weakly supervised learning at large scale.So in summary, the central research question is assessing the effectiveness of using MAE as an initialization for large-scale weakly supervised pretraining, with the hypothesis that this simple pre-pretraining approach will improve model performance and efficiency even at billion-scale datasets. The paper conducts experiments to test this hypothesis across different models, tasks, and datasets.
