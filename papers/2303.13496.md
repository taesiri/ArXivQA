# [The effectiveness of MAE pre-pretraining for billion-scale pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13496)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How effective is using MAE pre-pretraining to initialize models before large-scale weakly supervised pretraining with billions of images?

The key hypothesis that the paper investigates is that adding an initial pre-pretraining stage with MAE before the standard weakly supervised pretraining will improve the performance and efficiency of the resulting models. 

Specifically, the paper examines:

- Whether MAE pre-pretraining helps with model convergence and downstream task performance when used to initialize models before pretraining on billions of weakly labeled images.

- If the improvements from MAE pre-pretraining hold for different model sizes (from millions to billions of parameters) and different pretraining dataset sizes (from millions to billions of images).

- Whether MAE pre-pretraining helps combine the benefits of self-supervised learning (with MAE) and weakly supervised learning at large scale.

So in summary, the central research question is assessing the effectiveness of using MAE as an initialization for large-scale weakly supervised pretraining, with the hypothesis that this simple pre-pretraining approach will improve model performance and efficiency even at billion-scale datasets. The paper conducts experiments to test this hypothesis across different models, tasks, and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a pre-pretraining stage using Masked Autoencoding (MAE) before the standard weakly supervised pretraining. This MAE-based pre-pretraining helps initialize the model weights.

2. It shows empirically that MAE pre-pretraining improves the performance of weakly supervised pretraining across different model sizes (86M to 6B parameters) and dataset sizes (1M to 3B images).

3. The paper demonstrates that MAE pre-pretraining improves both model convergence during pretraining and downstream transfer performance on various tasks like image classification, object detection, video action recognition etc.

4. The results indicate that MAE scales well with both model size and dataset size. Using MAE pre-pretraining on billions of Instagram images and larger ViT models gives better performance compared to using MAE with ImageNet-1K only.

5. The combination of self-supervised (MAE) and weakly supervised (supervised pretraining) learning in the pre-pretraining framework outperforms using either technique alone.

6. The paper establishes that model initialization plays a significant role even at the web-scale pretrained model size and datasets. The simple MAE-based pre-pretraining technique consistently improves performance of models trained on billions of images.

In summary, the key contribution is showing the effectiveness of a simple MAE-based pre-pretraining stage for large-scale weakly supervised pretraining, leading to improved performance, convergence and efficiency.
