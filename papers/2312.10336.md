# [Certified Minimax Unlearning with Generalization Rates and Deletion   Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of machine unlearning for minimax models. Minimax models are machine learning models that optimize two sets of variables - the primal variables and the dual variables. Examples include generative adversarial networks, robust learning models, and reinforcement learning models. Most prior work on machine unlearning has focused on standard statistical learning (STL) models that optimize only a single set of parameters. However, unlearning for minimax models is not well studied. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper develops a new algorithm for certified minimax unlearning. Certified unlearning provides theoretical guarantees that the unlearning process sufficiently removes the influence of deleted data. The proposed algorithm has the following key aspects:

1) It introduces a minimax unlearning step based on the total Hessian matrix and complete Newton update. This accounts for the interdependence between the primal and dual variables. 

2) It injects calibrated Gaussian noise, inspired by differential privacy, to achieve the rigorous $(\epsilon, \delta)$-certified unlearning guarantee. This requires carefully bounding the sensitivity between the unlearning variables and retraining-from-scratch variables.

3) It further proposes a more efficient extension based on proximal infinitesimal jackknife to avoid recomputing the total Hessian. This also allows handling online/successive unlearning requests.


Main Contributions:

1) Develops the first certified machine unlearning algorithm tailored to minimax models with theoretical guarantees.

2) Provides generalization rates for the after-unlearning models in terms of population primal-dual risks.

3) Derives deletion capacity results that formally quantify the maximum number of samples that can be removed while maintaining good generalization. The deletion capacity matches state-of-the-art results for STL unlearning.

4) Extends the algorithm and analysis to handle more general loss functions like convex-concave losses.

5) Proposes a more efficient unlearning algorithm variation that avoids repeatedly recomputing the total Hessian.

In summary, the paper addresses the open problem of machine unlearning for minimax models, with rigorous theoretical guarantees on privacy, generalization, and deletion capacity. The results match or improve state-of-the-art guarantees for standard statistical learning models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a new algorithm for certified machine unlearning of minimax models, establishing guarantees on privacy, generalization performance, and deletion capacity that match the state-of-the-art for standard statistical learning models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It develops a new $(\epsilon,\delta)$-certified machine unlearning algorithm for minimax models, consisting of a complete Newton update based on the total Hessian and a Gaussian mechanism for perturbation. This is different from prior work on unlearning for standard statistical learning models that rely only on the direct Hessian. 

2. It provides a formal analysis of the proposed minimax unlearning algorithm, including:
(a) Guarantees for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-certified unlearning 
(b) Generalization bounds in terms of population primal-dual risk
(c) Deletion capacity results that characterize how many samples can be deleted while maintaining good generalization

3. The rates obtained for generalization and deletion capacity match the state-of-the-art results for standard statistical learning models. Specifically, the deletion capacity is $\mathcal{O}(n/d^{1/4})$, improving over differential privacy-based minimax learning that has $\mathcal{O}(n/d^{1/2})$.

4. It extends the certified minimax unlearning framework to handle more general loss functions beyond strongly-convex-strongly-concave, including convex-concave losses.

5. It provides a more efficient extension that avoids recomputing the total Hessian during unlearning and can handle online deletion requests.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a principled framework and analysis for certified machine unlearning tailored to minimax models, with theoretical guarantees on privacy, generalization, and deletion capacity.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the certified machine unlearning method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new minimax unlearning step consisting of a total Hessian-based complete Newton update. How does this differ from prior machine unlearning methods for standard statistical learning models that utilize the direct Hessian matrix? What is the intuition behind using the total Hessian here?

2. The paper injects calibrated Gaussian noise to achieve $(\epsilon, \delta)$-certified minimax unlearning. How is the noise scale and calibration derived? What notions from differential privacy are borrowed here and why? 

3. For the generalization results, the paper utilizes the population primal-dual (PD) risk as the measure. What does this measure capture that is suitable for minimax models? How does it differ from generalization measures used for standard statistical learning models?

4. The deletion capacity result matches the state-of-the-art for standard statistical learning models. What drives this similarity? Does the minimax structure not impact the deletion capacity and why?

5. How does the paper extend the certified minimax unlearning framework to other loss functions like convex-concave losses? What changes are made to make the analysis work for such losses?

6. The efficient extension in the paper gets rid of recomputing the total Hessian during minimax unlearning. What motivation does this extension have? What practical appealing property does it offer?  

7. What assumptions are made on the minimax loss functions in order to derive the certified minimax unlearning guarantees? How do they compare with typical assumptions made in minimax optimization works?

8. For the overall rates of generalization and deletion capacity, where does the $d^{1/4}$ term stem from in the denominator? How does this lead to gaps compared to differential privacy-based minimax learning?

9. The paper focuses on offline unlearning. How might the analysis change if we want to offer privacy protection for online or continual data deletion requests?

10. A common concern for approximate unlearning methods is that they do not fully remove the data influence. What can we say about the data influence removal offered by the certified minimax unlearning method proposed in this paper?
