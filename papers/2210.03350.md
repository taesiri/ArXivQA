# [Measuring and Narrowing the Compositionality Gap in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03350)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question this paper addresses is:How does the ability of language models to perform compositional reasoning scale with model size, and can techniques like elicitive prompting help improve compositional reasoning abilities?Specifically, the authors seem focused on investigating:- Whether the "compositionality gap" (the fraction of compositional questions the model gets wrong despite answering the sub-questions correctly) decreases as language model size increases. - Whether elicitive prompting techniques like "chain of thought" and their proposed "self-ask" method can help narrow this compositionality gap by allowing models to reason more explicitly.- Whether integrating search engines with the self-ask method can further improve compositional reasoning performance.So in summary, the main research questions revolve around measuring and trying to improve the compositional reasoning abilities of large language models using elicitive prompting and search engine integration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing methods to improve the compositional reasoning abilities of language models. Specifically:- The paper introduces the concept of the "compositionality gap" to quantify how often models can answer individual sub-questions but fail to compose them to answer a full compositional question. Experiments show this gap does not decrease with model scale.- The paper demonstrates that "elicitive prompting" methods like chain of thought that have models reason step-by-step can narrow the compositionality gap compared to standard prompting.- The paper proposes a new elicitive prompting method called "self-ask" where models explicitly ask and answer follow-up questions before answering the main question. This further improves compositional reasoning over chain of thought. - The explicit sub-question structure of self-ask also enables easily integrating a search engine to answer sub-questions, further boosting performance.Overall, the main contribution is developing new analysis methods and prompting techniques to measure and improve the compositional reasoning abilities of large language models. The concepts of the compositionality gap and elicitive prompting are novel ways proposed in this work to analyze and enhance compositionality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper investigates the compositional reasoning abilities of large language models using multi-hop question answering, and finds they have a constant "compositionality gap" that elicitive prompting like self-ask can narrow.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in compositional reasoning and question answering:This paper focuses on systematically evaluating and improving the compositional reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, using multi-hop question answering as the evaluation task. - It introduces a new metric called the "compositionality gap" to quantify how often LLMs can answer individual sub-questions but fail to compose them to answer the full question. This provides a quantitative way to measure compositional reasoning that hasn't been used before.- The paper shows that the compositionality gap remains constant at around 40% as LLM scale increases, suggesting limited improvement in compositional reasoning from pretraining scale alone. This is a novel finding not demonstrated in prior work. - The paper demonstrates that elicitive prompting methods like chain of thought can narrow the compositionality gap, outperforming prior work on decomposing questions like least-to-most prompting.- The new self-ask prompting method explicitly decomposes questions, improving over chain of thought. Integrating search further improves performance. Using search engines to answer sub-questions is a relatively underexplored technique in prior question answering work.Overall, this paper provides novel insights into evaluating and improving compositional reasoning in LLMs through new metrics, datasets, and prompting techniques. The analysis of model scale and compositional abilities is especially unique. The elicitive prompting methods also outperform prior question decomposition techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions in the paper:- Testing even larger language models beyond 175 billion parameters to see if the compositionality gap continues to persist at those scales.- Evaluating the compositional reasoning abilities of models on additional datasets beyond the English 2-hop question answering datasets used in this work, such as semantic parsing datasets, arithmetic reasoning datasets, logical puzzle datasets, etc.  - Expanding the analysis to languages other than English.- Further analyzing the relationship between model confidence on 1-hop questions and ability to compose the facts to answer 2-hop questions.- Developing elicitive prompting approaches like self-ask for additional tasks beyond question answering.- Exploring other ways to integrate external knowledge sources like search engines into large language models to aid compositional reasoning.- Developing new model architectures and training objectives to better support compositional generalization.In summary, the main future directions are exploring compositional reasoning more extensively across different models, datasets, languages and tasks, and developing improved methods to enhance compositional abilities, via elicitive prompting, knowledge integration, and architectural innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates the ability of large language models like GPT-3 to perform compositional reasoning, where the solution to a complex question depends on combining the answers to simpler sub-questions. The authors introduce a new metric called the "compositionality gap" which measures how often models can answer the sub-questions correctly but fail to compose them to generate the full answer. Using multi-hop questions with facts unlikely to be seen together during pretraining, they show the gap is around 40% for GPT-3 models of varying sizes, indicating scale alone does not substantially improve compositional reasoning. They then demonstrate that techniques like chain of thought prompting that allow models to "think aloud" can narrow this gap by enabling more reasoning steps. Finally, they introduce a new elicitive prompting method called "self-ask" where models explicitly ask and answer sub-questions before tackling the complex question, further improving compositional reasoning. This also enables easy integration of search engines to enhance performance. Overall, the work systematically reveals limits in reasoning abilities of large language models, while showing ways elicitive prompting can mitigate these weaknesses.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates the ability of language models to perform compositional reasoning, where the overall solution to a problem depends on correctly composing the answers to sub-problems. The authors introduce a new metric called the "compositionality gap" which measures how often models can correctly answer sub-questions but fail to compose them to generate the overall solution. They evaluate this metric using a new dataset of multi-hop questions whose answers require composing two facts that are unlikely to have been observed together during pretraining. The paper shows that as GPT-3 model size increases, the compositionality gap remains constant at around 40%, suggesting scale alone does not improve compositional reasoning abilities. The authors then demonstrate that elicitive prompting methods like chain of thought that have models reason explicitly can narrow this gap. They introduce a new elicitive prompting method called "self-ask" where models ask and answer sub-questions before answering the overall question. This further improves compositional reasoning. Finally, they show self-ask can easily integrate search engines to answer the sub-questions, further boosting accuracy.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper investigates the ability of language models to perform compositional reasoning - answering questions that require combining multiple facts that were unlikely to have been observed together during pretraining. The authors introduce the "compositionality gap", which measures the fraction of such compositional questions that models fail on despite answering the constituent sub-questions correctly. They find this gap persists at ~40% even as model scale increases, showing limited compositional reasoning ability. To address this, the authors demonstrate "elicitive prompting" methods like chain of thought that allow models to reason more explicitly. They introduce a new elicitive method, "self-ask", where the model asks and answers sub-questions itself before answering the overall question. This structuring improves compositional reasoning abilities. Finally, they plug a search engine into self-ask to answer the sub-questions, further boosting performance. Overall, elicitive prompting narrows the compositionality gap, enabling stronger compositional reasoning in large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper is addressing the issue of evaluating and improving language models' ability to perform compositional reasoning. Specifically:- It introduces a new metric called the "compositionality gap" to measure how often models can answer individual sub-questions but fail to compose those facts to generate the full solution for multi-hop questions. - It tests this metric on a new dataset of automatically generated multi-hop questions (Compositional Celebrities) where the individual facts are common but the full question combinations are unlikely to have been seen before.- It finds that the compositionality gap remains high (~40%) even as model scale increases, showing current LMs struggle with compositional reasoning. - It demonstrates that "elicitive prompting" methods like chain of thought that allow models to decompose questions explicitly can narrow this gap. - It introduces a new elicitive prompting method called "self-ask" where the model asks and answers follow-up questions itself before answering the full question.- It shows self-ask further improves compositional reasoning over chain of thought, especially on a varied manually constructed dataset of multi-hop questions.So in summary, the key focus is evaluating and improving the compositional reasoning abilities of large language models using new metrics and prompting techniques.
