# [Assessment of the Reliablity of a Model's Decision by Generalizing   Attribution to the Wavelet Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14979)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions addressed in this paper are:

1. How can we expand attribution methods to better characterize what features a deep learning model relies on for its predictions, beyond just where it is looking in the image? 

2. How can attribution be connected to the analysis of model robustness, by attributing importance in the scale/frequency domain rather than just the spatial domain?

3. Can analysing model attributions in the wavelet scale domain provide insights into the reliability and consistency of deep model predictions?

Specifically, the authors propose a new attribution method called the Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM) that attributes importance to regions of the wavelet transform of an input image, rather than just to spatial regions. 

The hypotheses seem to be:

- Attributing in the wavelet scale domain will reveal what structural features (textures, edges, shapes) at different scales the model relies on, providing a richer explanation than spatial attribution alone.

- Connecting attribution to scales also connects it to the frequency domain, enabling analysis of model robustness since scales correspond to frequency bands. 

- Applying this attribution method can expose inconsistencies in the scales models rely on, indicating they are not robust or reliable in their predictions.

So in summary, the key goals are to expand attribution to the scale domain to better characterize model decisions, connect attribution to robustness, and use this to assess model reliability. The WCAM method is proposed as a way to test these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the key contributions of this paper:

- It introduces a new black-box attribution method called the Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM). This method expands attribution from the pixel domain to the scale-space (wavelet) domain by perturbing the wavelet transform of an image and estimating the importance of different regions using total Sobol indices. 

- The WCAM reveals not just where a model is looking in an image, but what scales and structural components (textures, edges, shapes) are most important. This provides more insight into the decision process compared to pixel-only attribution methods.

- By attributing in the wavelet domain, the WCAM connects to frequency-based analysis of model robustness. It shows the method can characterize model robustness by revealing reliance on low vs high frequencies.

- The paper demonstrates how the WCAM can be used to assess the reliability of a prediction in terms of relevance (does it rely on expected semantic factors) and robustness. This could enable more reliable deployment in expert domains like medical imaging.

- Analysis using the WCAM uncovers concerning scale inconsistency in deep learning models. The same models look at different scales for different instances of the same class, suggesting reliance on contextual shortcuts rather than robust semantic features.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing attribution in the wavelet scale domain to gain new insights into model decisions, robustness, and reliability compared to pixel-only attribution methods. The scale domain bridges explainability and robustness analysis.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new attribution method called the Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM) that expands attribution from the pixel domain to the wavelet domain, enabling the assessment of both the relevance and robustness of a deep learning model's decisions by highlighting the important scales and locations in the input image.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in explainable AI and model robustness:

- It introduces a new attribution method, the Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM), that expands attribution to the wavelet (space-scale) domain instead of just the pixel (space) domain like most attribution methods. This allows for assessing the relevance and robustness of a model's predictions.

- It connects attribution with frequency analysis for model robustness. The paper shows the WCAM can characterize model robustness by estimating the importance of different frequency components, consistent with prior work using Fourier analysis. 

- The paper documents concerning "scale inconsistencies" - models rely on different factors/scales for different instances, even within the same class. This is related to findings on context-dependent "frequency shortcuts" in other recent work.

- The WCAM attribution maps allow reconstructing "minimal" images with sufficient info for correct prediction. This could have applications like transfer learning for compressed sensing.

- The approach does not require access to training data like some methods (e.g. influence functions). But it is more expensive than gradient or perturbation-based attribution methods.

- Overall, the paper bridges explainability and robustness analysis using novel wavelet decomposition. It provides both visual and quantitative analysis tools compared to prior work focused just on pixels or frequencies separately.

In summary, the key novelties are connecting attribution and robustness via wavelets, the scale inconsistency analysis, and potential applications like minimal image reconstruction. But it does require more computations than typical attribution methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Evaluating the benefits of the WCAM in real-world expert settings like medical imaging or remote sensing, where assessing the reliability and robustness of model decisions is crucial. The authors plan to apply the WCAM to tasks like rooftop solar panel detection in satellite imagery.

- Improving the computational efficiency of the WCAM to make it more practical compared to standard attribution methods. 

- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics for the WCAM to assess the robustness and reliability of model decisions beyond just visual inspection. For example, linking the WCAM with out-of-distribution detection techniques.

- Using the WCAM to further analyze potentially harmful biases in models, like those that may arise from dataset biases like in ImageNet. The scale inconsistencies highlighted by the WCAM could reveal biases.

- Applying the WCAM to additional model architectures beyond CNNs and Vision Transformers to see if scale inconsistencies are a more general issue with deep learning optimization.

- Further analysis into the underlying mechanisms behind the scale inconsistencies unveiled by the WCAM. The authors suggest links to gradient starvation and frequency shortcut learning phenomena.

- Exploring whether the WCAM could help identify more robust models, since it can highlight reliance on fragile small-scale patterns.

- Developing modified training procedures to encourage models to rely on more stable large-scale patterns highlighted by the WCAM.

In general, the authors position the WCAM as a tool to improve model reliability in real-world settings by auditing relevance and robustness, and suggest numerous directions to build on it.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel black-box attribution method called the Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM) that expands attribution from the pixel domain to the scale-space domain using wavelet transforms. The WCAM highlights important regions in the scale-space domain by efficiently perturbing the wavelet transform of the input image and estimating the contribution of regions using total Sobol indices. Compared to existing attribution methods that only identify important regions in the pixel space, the WCAM reveals what scales (corresponding to semantic features like textures and shapes) are important for a model's prediction. This provides more guidance on the relevance of the model's decision process. The WCAM also connects attribution to robustness since scales map to frequencies. Applications include assessing if models rely on robust and relevant factors, which is key for reliability. The authors discuss using WCAM in expert domains like medical imaging and remote sensing. Initial results show WCAM can quantify model robustness through scale embeddings and reveal concerning scale inconsistencies in models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a model testbench comprising convolutional neural networks like ResNet-50 and vision transformers like ViT-B16. Six popular training strategies are considered - standard training, robust training (AugMix, PixMix, SIN), and adversarial training (standard, fast, free). These models are evaluated on ImageNet and ImageNet-C datasets. ImageNet-C features common image corruptions like blur, noise, compression artifacts. The robustness of models to these corruptions is analyzed.

The main contribution is a novel attribution method called Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM). It expands attribution from pixel space to wavelet scale space. This highlights which structural components (textures, edges, shapes) at which scales are important for the model's predictions. Since wavelet scales correspond to frequencies, WCAM also evaluates model robustness like Fourier methods. WCAM enables assessing if a prediction relies on relevant, robust factors. It shows models are inconsistent across scales for samples of the same class. The cause may be optimization shortcuts like gradient starvation. WCAM has applications in evaluating reliability in expert domains like medical imaging. Limitations are higher computation cost than pixel attribution methods. 


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel attribution method called the Wavelet Scale Attribution Method (WCAM) to explain image classifiers. The WCAM expands attribution from the pixel domain to the wavelet domain by quantifying the importance of regions in the wavelet transform of an image to a model's predictions. It does this by perturbing the wavelet transform of an input image using masks generated from a quasi-Monte Carlo sequence. The perturbed wavelet transforms are inverted to create perturbed input images which are fed to the model to obtain predictions. The predictions are then used along with the perturbation masks to estimate the total Sobol indices of the regions in the wavelet transform using Jansen's estimator. The total Sobol indices indicate the importance of the wavelet regions and thus provide an explanation in the wavelet domain of what features at what scales contribute to the model's predictions. By attributing in the wavelet domain, the WCAM reveals the importance of different structural components like textures and shapes, providing more insight than pixel-space attribution.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of how to better explain and understand the decisions made by deep neural network image classifiers. Specifically, it aims to develop a method that can provide insight into both where a model is looking in the input image (spatial relevance) and what visual features or scales it is relying on (semantic relevance). It also wants to connect this to assessing the robustness or reliability of the model's decisions.

Some key questions the paper seems to be exploring:

- How can we expand attribution methods beyond just highlighting important regions in the pixel space, to also convey what scales or visual concepts a model is relying on?

- Can connecting attribution to the wavelet domain provide a way to simultaneously assess the relevance and robustness of a model's decisions?

- What factors do models actually rely on when making predictions, and are they focusing on robust, semantically meaningful attributes or potentially meaningless shortcuts? 

- Are models consistent in terms of the scales and features they use across different instances of the same class, or is their decision process highly variable?

So in summary, the key goals are developing a better attribution method to explain what models see, using this to evaluate the reliability of their predictions in terms of relevance and robustness, and gaining insight into their decision processes. The paper aims to address the limitations of existing attribution methods and connect explainability to assessing model reliability.
