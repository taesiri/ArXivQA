# [CAS: A General Algorithm for Online Selective Conformal Prediction with   FCR Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07728)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of post-selection predictive inference in an online fashion. Specifically, at each time step $t$, a feature-response pair $(X_t,Y_t)$ is observed. An online selection rule $\Pi_t(\cdot)$ is used to decide whether to report a prediction interval for $Y_t$ based on $X_t$ and previous data. The goal is to construct valid prediction intervals that have guaranteed coverage conditional on being selected (selection-conditional coverage) while controlling the false coverage-statement rate (FCR), which measures the average miscoverage rate over time. This is challenging due to the temporal dependence introduced by the online selection rule.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an algorithm called CAS (Calibration After Adaptive Selection) that wraps around any prediction model to output selective prediction intervals. The key ideas are:

1) Use an adaptive selection rule on past data to construct a calibration set whenever a point is selected at time $t$. This is designed carefully for different selection rules to ensure exchangeability after selection.  

2) Report conformal prediction intervals using quantiles of residuals on the calibration set.

Main Contributions:

1) Proved that CAS guarantees finite-sample, distribution-free selection-conditional coverage for two classes of online selection rules: decision-driven rules and rules using symmetric thresholds.

2) Showed that CAS provably controls FCR under the target level for decision-driven rules without distributional assumptions. For symmetric thresholds, derived FCR control bounds.

3) Proposed a variant of CAS built on top of dynamic conformal inference methods to achieve long-run FCR control under distribution shift.

4) Demonstrated through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets that CAS effectively controls FCR while providing shorter prediction intervals compared to benchmarks.

Overall, the paper provides a general and flexible framework for selective predictive inference that can be applied under different online selection mechanisms with both theoretical and empirical backing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a general algorithm called CAS for constructing online prediction intervals with false coverage rate control after performing adaptive selection on historical data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new method called CAS (Calibration After Adaptive Selection) for constructing prediction intervals that have selection-conditional coverage guarantees in online selective prediction problems. The key contributions are:

1) CAS can wrap around any prediction model and online selection rule to output post-selection prediction intervals that have finite-sample, distribution-free selection-conditional coverage.

2) For decision-driven selection rules like those used in online FDR control, CAS can exactly control the false coverage-statement rate (FCR) without distributional assumptions. 

3) For selection rules based on symmetric thresholds like sample means/quantiles, CAS can still achieve selection-conditional coverage. Bounds on the FCR are provided under mild assumptions, with the errors going to 0 asymptotically.

4) CAS is adapted to handle distribution shift in online data by leveraging past coverage feedback and techniques from adaptive conformal prediction. This version can achieve long-run FCR control.

5) Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that CAS consistently provides accurate FCR control around the target level, while constructing shorter prediction intervals compared to benchmarks.

In summary, the key innovation is a general framework to construct post-selection prediction intervals that have conditional validity guarantees, with strong theoretical properties and empirical performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an algorithm called CAS that wraps around any prediction model and online selection rule to output post-selection prediction intervals. Can you explain in more detail how CAS is able to work with arbitrary prediction models and selection rules? What properties of the selection rules are leveraged by CAS?

2. A key component of CAS is the use of an adaptive selection step on the historical data to construct the calibration set. Can you explain the intuition behind why this adaptive selection is necessary and how the specific adaptive selection strategies are designed? 

3. For decision-driven selection rules, CAS is able to achieve exact FCR control without distributional assumptions. What aspects of decision-driven rules enable this finite sample, distribution-free guarantee? And what is the main challenge in analyzing FCR for more general selection rules?

4. How does CAS address the issue of exchangeability that arises from online data-driven selection? What would happen if CAS did not properly account for the selection effect on exchangeability?

5. The paper embeds CAS into dynamically-tuned adaptive conformal prediction methods to handle distribution shift. Can you explain in more detail how distribution shift is accounted for and why CAS needs to be modified to still control FCR with shifting distributions?

6. What are the key theoretical contributions of the CAS algorithm and its analysis? What advantages does it have over previous methods like LORD-CI in terms of assumptions, guarantees, and practical performance? 

7. The paper discusses an application of CAS to drug discovery experiments. What aspects of that application motivate the need for selective prediction intervals? And how would you expect CAS to perform on other real-world applications?

8. How does the performance of CAS compare empirically to benchmarks methods on metrics like interval width and FCR control across different data generating settings? When does it demonstrate the most significant advantages?

9. What variations of CAS could be developed, for example, to work under different classes of selection rules, leverage different types of prediction models, or relax certain assumptions?

10. What open questions remain regarding controlling FCR in online selective prediction settings? What future work could build upon the CAS algorithm proposed in this paper?
