# [TILP: Differentiable Learning of Temporal Logical Rules on Knowledge   Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Temporal knowledge graphs (tKGs) extend standard knowledge graphs by associating facts with valid time intervals rather than simply asserting timeless facts. This allows capturing the evolution of facts over time. However, reasoning over tKGs for tasks like link prediction is more difficult due to the complexity introduced by temporal information. Prior methods have limitations in terms of interpretability or ability to handle diverse temporal patterns and datasets.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes TILP, a differentiable inductive learning framework for temporal logical rules on tKGs. The key ideas are:

(1) Design a constrained random walk mechanism over tKGs that enforces temporal logic rules as path constraints. This extracts walks satisfying target temporal relations. 

(2) Introduce temporal operators and explicitly model key temporal features like recurrence, temporal order, interval between relations, and duration. This captures fine-grained temporal interactions.

(3) Implement the framework via neural networks for end-to-end differentiable learning of (a) attention vectors that score usefulness of rules and temporal constraints (b) distribution parameters for the temporal features.

Main Contributions:

(1) TILP is the first differentiable approach for learning interpretable temporal logical rules from tKGs without restrictions on rule forms.

(2) Experiments on two tKG benchmarks show TILP matches or improves over state-of-the-art temporal KG embedding methods in link prediction, while also providing explanatory predictions.

(3) TILP demonstrates superior robustness in challenging scenarios with limited training data, biased data, or shift between train and test time periods. This highlights the benefits of learning flexible relative temporal constraints.

In summary, TILP advances the state-of-the-art in reasoning on temporal knowledge graphs by an interpretable neural-symbolic approach for learning useful temporal logic rule structures from data.
