# [Cascade-Zero123: One Image to Highly Consistent 3D with Self-Prompted   Nearby Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04424)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Cascade-Zero123, a novel cascade framework to improve the consistency and quality of novel view synthesis from a single image using latent diffusion models. It consists of two stages: Base-0123 generates nearby views from the input image, then Refiner-0123 takes both the input image and nearby views as conditions to produce the final target view. This decomposes the difficult one-to-one view rotation into two easier sub-tasks. The nearby views provide useful multi-view context and guidance for generating consistent novel views. Both stages leverage Zero-1-to-3 models and are trained with a self-distillation strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate Cascade-Zero123 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like Zero123-XL and SyncDreamer on complex scenes with insects, humans, transparent objects etc. The key innovation is the self-prompted nearby views which enable latent diffusion models to establish better geometric and visual consistency while retaining generalization capabilities from pre-training. The proposed cascade framework is simple yet effective.
