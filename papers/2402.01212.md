# [TSJNet: A Multi-modality Target and Semantic Awareness Joint-driven   Image Fusion Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01212)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) methods focus primarily on enhancing the image fusion itself, but overlook the potential mutual benefits between image fusion and downstream tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection. 
- Current methods do not adequately capture the differences in significant object, background and semantic information across modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Target and Semantic Awareness Joint-driven Fusion Network (TSJNet) that incorporates both object detection and semantic segmentation networks to guide the image fusion process.

- The framework includes 3 subnetworks - fusion, detection (Faster R-CNN), and segmentation (DeepLabV3+), connected in a series structure.

- A Local Significant Feature extraction module (LSM) with parallel double branches is proposed to fully capture fine-grained cross-modal features and enable better fusion.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to simultaneously leverage both detection and segmentation networks to drive the fusion, establishing mutual benefits between fusion and high-level perception tasks.

- Novel LSM module to enhance cross-modal feature representation and fusion flexibility.

- Extensive experiments conducted on 4 datasets - MSRS, M3FD, RoadScene and LLVIP. Results show superiority over state-of-the-art with higher segmentation mIoU by 7.47% and detection mAP by 2.84% on average.

In summary, the key idea is driving image fusion using high-level semantic and target cues from detection & segmentation subnetworks, while allowing improved perception performance on fused images. The proposed TSJNet framework and LSM module enable this cross-task joint optimization effectively.
