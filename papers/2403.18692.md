# [Teaching Introductory HRI: UChicago Course "Human-Robot Interaction:   Research and Practice"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18692)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper describes a university course titled "Human-Robot Interaction: Research and Practice" taught by Sarah Sebo at the University of Chicago. The goal of the course is to serve as an introduction to human-robot interaction (HRI) research for both undergraduate and graduate students. 

The course has three main learning objectives: (1) give students a broad understanding of cutting-edge HRI research through readings and discussions, (2) help students develop critical thinking skills to evaluate HRI research, and (3) provide hands-on HRI research experience through a course project.

The course structure involves reading and discussing one research paper per class on topics like nonverbal behavior, social dynamics, ethics, collaboration, and applications of HRI. Students take turns leading discussions and writing peer reviews of papers. The instructor also brings in some authors as guest presenters.

The highlight of the course is a quarter-long research project done in groups. Students design and conduct their own HRI study, which often involves programming a robot and running a study with human participants. Deliverables include a project proposal, IRB application, progress reports, final report, and presentation.  

The course grading breakdown is: 60% project, 20% analytical comments on readings, 10% discussion leadership and peer reviews, and 10% participation.

Student feedback indicates vibrant class discussions, appreciation of the hands-on project, and a desire for more explicit instruction on HRI research methods. 

The instructor reflects that the project and discussions are effective, but additional lectures on methods may reduce the learning curve for students new to HRI research. Overall the course appears to serve as an engaging, hands-on introduction to the field of HRI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes the structure and learning goals of an introductory human-robot interaction course taught at the University of Chicago that focuses on student-led discussions of research papers and hands-on final projects where students conduct their own human-robot interaction studies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper details the structure, learning goals, student feedback, and reflections on an introductory human-robot interaction (HRI) course taught at the University of Chicago. Specifically, it describes the hands-on course project where students conduct their own HRI research study, the paper reading and discussion format of class meetings, and student feedback and instructor reflections on the strengths and weaknesses of the course. The paper aims to provide insights into effective methods for teaching introductory HRI through sharing experiences teaching this course. So in summary, the main contribution is providing an in-depth look into an introductory HRI course in terms of its format, projects, and reflections in order to inform HRI education.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper for teaching an introductory HRI course:

1. The paper mentions that typically only 20 students are enrolled in this course to enable fruitful in-class discussions. How might the course structure and content need to be adapted if taught in a larger class setting with 50+ students?

2. The paper emphasizes the importance of having vibrant class discussions about HRI research papers. What specific strategies and teaching techniques help facilitate high-quality discussions among students? 

3. The course project is highlighted as a core strength of this course. What key factors contribute to students having a meaningful hands-on HRI research experience through the course project?

4. What considerations went into selecting the variety of robots offered to students for their course projects? What benefits or limitations exist with the specific set of robots available?  

5. The paper discusses allowing students flexibility in the type of course project pursued. What might be some challenges in effectively supporting and evaluating the diverse project options?

6. What measures are taken to ensure students conduct ethical human-subjects research studies? How is the quality of studentsâ€™ IRB applications evaluated?

7. What resources or guidance are provided to students as they work to program robots for their course projects? What common challenges arise?  

8. How are teams coordinated and conflicts mediated through the quarter-long collaboration on course projects? What team work strategies are imparted?

9. How might the suggested course project timelines need to be adapted for courses running on different academic schedules (quarters vs semesters)?

10. What learning outcomes are assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of this course structure in teaching introductory HRI concepts? What methods are used to quantify outcomes?
