# [MovieQA: Understanding Stories in Movies through Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02902)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we create a robust question-answering dataset to evaluate machine comprehension of both complex videos (movies) and accompanying text sources?

The key hypothesis is that such a dataset, with diverse question types and multiple information sources, will help push automatic semantic understanding to a higher level needed for full story comprehension.

In particular, the paper introduces the MovieQA dataset which contains questions about movies along with video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and described video narrations. The questions range from simpler factual queries to more complex "Why" and "How" reasoning questions. 

The authors argue that answering this diverse set of open-ended questions about movies will require deeper machine understanding of both the video content and text semantics. They provide analysis and baseline experiments that showcase the difficulty of MovieQA compared to existing QA datasets. Overall, the paper frames MovieQA as a challenging benchmark to drive progress in video and text understanding for the complex QA task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of the MovieQA dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of stories from both video and text. The key highlights of the dataset are:

- It contains 14,944 multiple choice questions sourced from over 400 movies with high semantic diversity. 

- The questions range from simpler "Who" did "What" to more complex "Why" and "How" certain events occurred, requiring reasoning about the events and motivations of characters.

- It provides multiple sources of information for answering the questions - video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and DVS transcripts. 

- For a subset of movies, it contains timestamp annotations aligning the questions and answers to video clips.

- The authors provide an analysis of the dataset statistics and characteristics. 

- They evaluate a range of baseline methods on the dataset, demonstrating that question answering on this data is challenging.

- They created an online benchmark and leaderboard to encourage further research on this dataset.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of this large-scale movie QA dataset to spur progress on story understanding and reasoning from both video and text. The diversity of question types and multiple information sources make this a unique and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine comprehension.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a brief analysis of how this paper on the MovieQA dataset compares to other related research:

- This paper introduces a new large-scale QA dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of videos and text stories. Other datasets like VQA and DAQUAR focus only on static images, while MovieQA uses videos and movie scripts. 

- The key contribution is the multi-modal nature of MovieQA - it provides multiple sources of information including video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and DVS descriptions. This allows testing QA methods that combine both visual and textual reasoning.

- With nearly 15K QA pairs sourced from over 400 movies, MovieQA is significantly larger and more diverse than previous video+language QA datasets. The questions require complex reasoning about events, motivations and emotions.

- The authors demonstrate the difficulty of MovieQA by testing various baselines including similarity methods and Memory Networks. The best approaches hardly exceed 40% accuracy, showing that existing QA techniques fall short on this dataset.

- MovieQA encourages research at the intersection of computer vision and NLP. The free-form natural language answers make it more challenging than VQA/DAQUAR which use shorter fixed responses.

- By releasing an evaluation benchmark and leaderboard, the paper enables standardized measurement of progress on this task over time. The multi-modal nature and complexity of MovieQA poses new challenges for QA research.

In summary, MovieQA pushes research towards multi-modal reasoning and QA with more natural language, advancing QA capabilities beyond current image-based datasets. The paper lays the foundation for an interesting new research direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced question answering techniques tailored for movie story comprehension that can effectively exploit the multiple modalities (text, video, etc.) in an integrated manner. The authors show that current methods have limited performance on the MovieQA dataset, so more advanced techniques need to be developed.

- Exploring semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods for question answering, since large amounts of unlabeled video and text data are available. The authors' methods rely on supervised learning, but leveraging unlabeled data could help improve performance.

- Studying long-term temporal reasoning and dependencies in videos. The questions in MovieQA often require understanding events that unfold over long periods of time in a movie. New techniques are needed to capture long-range temporal context. 

- Creating datasets that require even deeper semantic reasoning about motivations, emotions, implicit relationships between events, etc. The authors suggest the MovieQA dataset could be expanded to include more complex inferential questions.

- Developing reinforced or interactive question answering agents that can gather additional information to answer questions within a dialogue. The single-turn question answering setting in MovieQA is limited.

- Combining visual question answering with other tasks like captioning to promote holistic scene understanding. Multi-task learning could help address limitations of isolated QA systems.

In summary, the authors suggest directions like more sophisticated QA techniques, leveraging unlabeled data, modeling long-term temporal context, more complex inferential questions, dialog agents, and multitask learning to overcome limitations of current QA methods. Advancing research in these areas could lead to more capable AI for deeper language and video understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MovieQA, a large-scale question-answering dataset about movies consisting of 14,944 multiple choice questions sourced from 408 movies. The questions have high semantic diversity, ranging from simple "Who" did "What" questions that can be answered with computer vision alone, to complex "Why" and "How" questions that require reasoning over both visual information and dialogs. The dataset contains diverse sources of information including video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and DVS transcripts. The authors analyze the dataset through statistics and by testing various intelligent baselines that mimic different student approaches to answering the questions. They extend existing QA techniques like memory networks to work with MovieQA and show that open-ended question-answering in this domain remains a difficult task, with the best methods achieving only around 30% accuracy. The authors have created an online benchmark and leaderboard to encourage further research on this challenging movie question-answering task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces MovieQA, a new question-answering dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of stories conveyed through both video and text. The dataset contains 14,944 multiple choice questions sourced from 408 movies, with one correct and four deceiving answers per question provided by human annotators. The questions range from simpler "Who" and "What" questions to more complex "Why" and "How" reasoning questions. 

The dataset includes multiple sources of information - video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and Described Video Service (DVS) annotations. For a subset of 140 movies, timestamp alignments are provided between questions/answers and video clips. The authors analyze the dataset through statistics and by testing several baseline methods, including extensions to existing QA techniques like memory networks. Results show the difficulty of this open-ended semantic QA task, with many methods performing only slightly better than random guessing. Overall, the paper introduces a novel and challenging benchmark to push automatic understanding of complex stories towards human levels.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces the MovieQA dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of stories from both videos and text. The dataset contains 14,944 multiple choice questions sourced from over 400 movies, with one correct and four deceiving answers per question provided by human annotators. The questions range from simpler "Who-What-Where" questions answerable by computer vision alone, to complex "Why" and "How" questions requiring reasoning over both visual and textual information. The authors provide baselines using variants of cosine similarity as well as convolutional and memory network architectures to score the relevance of parts of the textual and visual inputs to the questions and answer choices. They show that current state-of-the-art QA techniques still perform poorly on MovieQA, demonstrating that question-answering on such open-ended semantics of videos and text remains an open challenge. The paper introduces the dataset and benchmark to encourage further work on this task.
