# [MovieQA: Understanding Stories in Movies through Question-Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02902)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we create a robust question-answering dataset to evaluate machine comprehension of both complex videos (movies) and accompanying text sources?The key hypothesis is that such a dataset, with diverse question types and multiple information sources, will help push automatic semantic understanding to a higher level needed for full story comprehension.In particular, the paper introduces the MovieQA dataset which contains questions about movies along with video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and described video narrations. The questions range from simpler factual queries to more complex "Why" and "How" reasoning questions. The authors argue that answering this diverse set of open-ended questions about movies will require deeper machine understanding of both the video content and text semantics. They provide analysis and baseline experiments that showcase the difficulty of MovieQA compared to existing QA datasets. Overall, the paper frames MovieQA as a challenging benchmark to drive progress in video and text understanding for the complex QA task.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of the MovieQA dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of stories from both video and text. The key highlights of the dataset are:- It contains 14,944 multiple choice questions sourced from over 400 movies with high semantic diversity. - The questions range from simpler "Who" did "What" to more complex "Why" and "How" certain events occurred, requiring reasoning about the events and motivations of characters.- It provides multiple sources of information for answering the questions - video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and DVS transcripts. - For a subset of movies, it contains timestamp annotations aligning the questions and answers to video clips.- The authors provide an analysis of the dataset statistics and characteristics. - They evaluate a range of baseline methods on the dataset, demonstrating that question answering on this data is challenging.- They created an online benchmark and leaderboard to encourage further research on this dataset.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction and analysis of this large-scale movie QA dataset to spur progress on story understanding and reasoning from both video and text. The diversity of question types and multiple information sources make this a unique and challenging benchmark for evaluating machine comprehension.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a brief analysis of how this paper on the MovieQA dataset compares to other related research:- This paper introduces a new large-scale QA dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of videos and text stories. Other datasets like VQA and DAQUAR focus only on static images, while MovieQA uses videos and movie scripts. - The key contribution is the multi-modal nature of MovieQA - it provides multiple sources of information including video clips, subtitles, scripts, plots, and DVS descriptions. This allows testing QA methods that combine both visual and textual reasoning.- With nearly 15K QA pairs sourced from over 400 movies, MovieQA is significantly larger and more diverse than previous video+language QA datasets. The questions require complex reasoning about events, motivations and emotions.- The authors demonstrate the difficulty of MovieQA by testing various baselines including similarity methods and Memory Networks. The best approaches hardly exceed 40% accuracy, showing that existing QA techniques fall short on this dataset.- MovieQA encourages research at the intersection of computer vision and NLP. The free-form natural language answers make it more challenging than VQA/DAQUAR which use shorter fixed responses.- By releasing an evaluation benchmark and leaderboard, the paper enables standardized measurement of progress on this task over time. The multi-modal nature and complexity of MovieQA poses new challenges for QA research.In summary, MovieQA pushes research towards multi-modal reasoning and QA with more natural language, advancing QA capabilities beyond current image-based datasets. The paper lays the foundation for an interesting new research direction.
