# [Household navigation and manipulation for everyday object rearrangement   tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06129)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents an integrated system for tidying up objects in a home environment using a mobile robot. The system utilizes modular components for semantic mapping, visual object and receptacle detection, preferential object rearrangement reasoning, robust manipulation planning, and long-horizon navigation across rooms. Specifically, it builds a 2D semantic map and detects misplaced objects using collaborative filtering to suggest corrected placements based on commonsense knowledge and personalized user preferences. The robot then manipulates the objects considering affordances, picks them up, navigates to target rooms first and then target receptacles, and finally places the objects. The system coordinates these capabilities using behavior trees that facilitate failure recovery and task restart. Real-world experiments on a Fetch robot validate the approach, including multi-room navigation, handling user preference diversity, and complex interactions like opening drawers. The integrated system demonstrates promising capabilities for performing long-horizon tidy-up tasks in real home environments. Future work involves longer-term autonomy and optimizing cleanup speed to approach human-level performance.
