# [Instruction-tuning Aligns LLMs to the Human Brain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00575)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key findings from the paper:

This paper explores whether instruction-tuning, a popular method for adapting large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to follow human instructions, makes the internal representations of LLMs more similar to human brain activity during language processing. The authors evaluated the brain activity alignment and behavioral alignment of 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs on three datasets involving humans reading stories and sentences. They found that instruction-tuning generally improves brain alignment by 6.2% on average, demonstrating it produces representations more similar to human neural processing. However, instruction-tuning did not reliably improve behavioral alignment between model and human reading patterns. Examining what factors correlate with brain alignment, the authors discovered brain alignment strongly correlates with world knowledge understanding and model size. This suggests mechanisms that store factual knowledge also drive model-brain representational similarities, highlighting the importance of world knowledge in developing aligned LLMs. Overall, the work shows instruction-tuning better aligns LLMs to human brains but not necessarily behavior, with world knowledge being a key determinant of model-brain similarities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the effect of instruction-tuning on improving the alignment between large language models and the human brain in language processing, finding it enhances brain alignment through improving world knowledge representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and the human language system. Specifically, they evaluate the impact of instruction-tuning on two aspects: (1) brain alignment - the similarity between LLM internal representations and human brain activity patterns, and (2) behavioral alignment - the similarity between LLM and human behavior on a reading task. 

They find that instruction-tuning generally improves brain alignment, increasing it by an average of 6.2% across the LLMs tested. However, instruction-tuning does not have a clear positive impact on behavioral alignment. 

Furthermore, the authors identify that world knowledge and model size are key factors underlying brain alignment, with strong positive correlations. This suggests that mechanisms in LLMs that encode world knowledge also improve alignment to human brain representations.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that instruction-tuning aligns LLMs more closely to human brain activity patterns, and this effect is linked to improvements in world knowledge representations. The paper provides new insights into the effect of instruction-tuning on LLM internal representations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper claims that instruction tuning aligns LLMs more closely to human brains. What specific analyses or experiments support this claim? How conclusive is the evidence?

2. The authors measure alignment in terms of brain activity patterns and behavioral patterns. In what ways do the results differ between these two types of alignment analyses? What might explain these differences? 

3. Instruction tuning relies on existing corpora of human demonstrations paired with instructions. To what extent could the choice of instruction datasets impact conclusions about alignment? How might the authors control for this?

4. The linear predictivity methodology makes assumptions about the linear relationship between model representations and brain activity. How might violations of this assumption impact their conclusions? What controls could address this?  

5. The paper identifies world knowledge and model size as key factors predicting alignment. How might other undisclosed computational properties of the LLMs also play a role? What future experiments could disentangle the contribution of world knowledge versus model scale or architecture?

6. The paper finds human-model alignment varies significantly across different datasets. What factors might account for this variance? How can dataset choice be optimized in future work?

7. The authors use Pearson correlation to quantify alignment. How might using different similarity metrics change the conclusions? What are the limitations of relying solely on Pearson r?

8. The choice of what layers are used from LLMs can impact reported alignment scores. How do the authors determine what layers should be evaluated? Do the conclusions change depending on what layers are chosen?

9. The paper assumes linear mappings adequately capture the relationship between LLM representations and brain activity. How might the conclusions change if using nonlinear mappings between model and brain?  

10. The paper studies vanilla and instruction-tuned versions of LLMs. How might other methods of tuning language models (e.g. reinforcement learning, data augmentation) impact alignment conclusions differently?

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper investigates whether instruction-tuning, a popular method for finetuning large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, makes the models more similar to the human language system. Specifically, the authors assess the impact of instruction-tuning on two types of model-human alignment: (1) brain alignment - how closely the models' internal representations match human brain activity patterns when processing language, and (2) behavioral alignment - how similar model and human behavior are on a reading task. 

Methods
The authors evaluate 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs from 77M to 33B parameters on 3 fMRI datasets of humans reading stories and sentences. Brain alignment is measured using a linear predictivity score between model representations and human brain activity. Behavioral alignment compares model perplexity and human reading times on a natural stories dataset. Factors underlying brain alignment are studied by correlating it to model properties like size, world knowledge, and reasoning abilities.

Key Findings
1) Instruction-tuning improves average brain alignment by 6.2% across models and datasets. Longitudinal tuning shows progressive increases in alignment.

2) Brain alignment strongly correlates with world knowledge scores (r=0.81) and model size (r=0.95), but not behavioral alignment.

3) Surprisingly, instruction-tuning does not enhance behavioral alignment to reading times. Furthermore, behavioral alignment poorly correlates with all other metrics like knowledge and model size.

Contributions  
The paper demonstrates that instruction-tuning better aligns LLM representations to human brain activity patterns. The analyses reveal that mechanisms encoding world knowledge also drive greater alignment. The results highlight the importance of integrating real-world knowledge into future LLM development. They also showcase the utility of instruction-tuned models for studying internal properties underlying model-brain similarities.
