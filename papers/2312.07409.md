# [DiffMorpher: Unleashing the Capability of Diffusion Models for Image   Morphing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07409)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper aims to enable smooth and natural image interpolation capabilities for diffusion models, similar to what GANs can achieve through latent code interpolation. However, directly interpolating in the latent space of diffusion models results in abrupt changes between images due to the lack of structure. Realizing smooth interpolations in diffusion models is challenging.  

Proposed Method
The paper proposes DiffMorpher, a novel approach to achieve smooth image morphing using only the prior knowledge from a pretrained diffusion model such as Stable Diffusion. The key ideas are:

1) Fit two low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to the two input images separately to encapsulate their semantic identities in the LoRA parameters. Interpolate between the LoRA parameters to ensure smooth semantic transition.

2) Obtain latent codes of input images via DDIM inversion and interpolate them spherically to provide spatial alignment. Combine with LoRA interpolation.

3) Propose self-attention interpolation for early denoising steps to enhance smoothness. Introduce AdaIN adjustment for color/brightness coherence.

4) Reschedule the sampling to equalize semantic change rates between frames.

Main Contributions
- First framework to enable diffusion models to generate smooth interpolations comparable to GANs, addressing a key limitation.

- LoRA interpolation and latent code interpolation method for semantic consistency.

- Self-attention control, AdaIN adjustment and resampling schedule for transition smoothness.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating stark improvements over prior arts in fidelity and smoothness. Significantly advances state-of-the-art in image morphing.

The proposed DiffMorpher effectively addresses the challenging problem of enabling smooth interpolations in diffusion models. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the superiority of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes DiffMorpher, a novel approach to achieve smooth and natural image interpolation with diffusion models by interpolating between low-rank adaptations fit to the input images along with other techniques to enhance semantic consistency and transition smoothness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new approach called "DiffMorpher" that enables smooth and natural image interpolation based on diffusion models. Specifically:

- It proposes to capture the semantics of two input images by fitting two low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to them separately, and interpolate between the LoRA parameters for smooth semantic transition.

- It combines LoRA interpolation with latent noise interpolation via DDIM inversion and slerp to generate high-quality and consistent intermediates. 

- It further introduces an attention interpolation and injection technique, an adaptive normalization adjustment method, and a new sampling schedule to enhance the smoothness between consecutive images in the morphing sequence.

- It is the first approach that achieves smooth image interpolation effects on diffusion models comparable to GANs, bridging a critical functional gap between the two types of generative models.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate the method significantly outperforms previous image morphing techniques in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. It well handles diverse object categories and unveils new opportunities of diffusion models.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling smooth image morphing on diffusion models by interpolating in both LoRA parameter space and latent space, combined with delicately designed control techniques in attention and normalization. This unveils the potential of diffusion models in a new application area that was previously dominated by GANs.

- AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization) - Used to adjust color/brightness between images to improve coherence.

- Sampling schedule - A proposed sampling schedule to redistribute interpolation parameters to equalize transition rate between frames.

- Smoothness - An important criteria for assessing quality of image morphing, related terms are consistency, coherence, transition smoothness.

- Fidelity - The realism and faithfulness of the intermediate images, measured by FID score.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the LoRA interpolation technique help capture the semantic identities of the input images and enable semantically meaningful transitions between images? Explain the working and effectiveness of this component. 

2) Explain the self-attention interpolation and replacement technique proposed in the paper. How does it help enhance the smoothness and consistency between consecutive frames in the generated video?

3) The paper proposes an adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) adjustment to align the color and brightness statistics between input images and generated intermediates. Elaborate on how this technique works and helps improve coherence.  

4) What is the motivation behind proposing a new rescheduling sampling technique? How is the relative perceptual distance estimated and used to determine the rescheduled interpolation parameters?

5) Discuss the differences between the latent spaces of GANs and diffusion models that make naive interpolations inadequate for smooth transitions in diffusion models. 

6) What are the advantages and disadvantages of using graphical morphing techniques over learning-based generative model techniques for image morphing?
