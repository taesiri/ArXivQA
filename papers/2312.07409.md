# [DiffMorpher: Unleashing the Capability of Diffusion Models for Image   Morphing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07409)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed one-paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a new approach called DiffMorpher to achieve smooth and natural image morphing based solely on the prior knowledge of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model like Stable Diffusion. Given two input images, the key idea is to capture their high-level semantics by fitting two low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to the diffusion model's parameters for each image separately. By interpolating between the two sets of LoRA parameters, semantically meaningful intermediate images can be generated. This is combined with spherical interpolation of the latent noises to create a smooth transition. Further techniques are introduced including interpolating and replacing the self-attention features, an adaptive instance normalization adjustment method to improve color/brightness consistency, and a new sampling schedule to equalize the transition rate. Experiments demonstrate that DiffMorpher produces significantly higher quality image morphing sequences compared to prior graphical and deep generative model approaches, with improved fidelity, consistency and smoothness. The ability to smoothly interpolate images in diffusion models opens up new opportunities compared to GANs. Limitations include the need to train an LoRA per input image and provide aligned text prompts. But overall, this work bridges a key gap between diffusion models and GANs for continuous image editing applications.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new approach called "DiffMorpher" that enables smooth and natural image interpolation based on diffusion models. Specifically:

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper aims to enable smooth and natural image interpolation capabilities for diffusion models, similar to what GANs can achieve through latent code interpolation. However, directly interpolating in the latent space of diffusion models results in abrupt changes between images due to the lack of structure. Realizing smooth interpolations in diffusion models is challenging.  

Proposed Method
The paper proposes DiffMorpher, a novel approach to achieve smooth image morphing using only the prior knowledge from a pretrained diffusion model such as Stable Diffusion. The key ideas are:

1) Fit two low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) to the two input images separately to encapsulate their semantic identities in the LoRA parameters. Interpolate between the LoRA parameters to ensure smooth semantic transition.

2) Obtain latent codes of input images via DDIM inversion and interpolate them spherically to provide spatial alignment. Combine with LoRA interpolation.

3) Propose self-attention interpolation for early denoising steps to enhance smoothness. Introduce AdaIN adjustment for color/brightness coherence.

4) Reschedule the sampling to equalize semantic change rates between frames.

Main Contributions
- First framework to enable diffusion models to generate smooth interpolations comparable to GANs, addressing a key limitation.

- LoRA interpolation and latent code interpolation method for semantic consistency.

- Self-attention control, AdaIN adjustment and resampling schedule for transition smoothness.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating stark improvements over prior arts in fidelity and smoothness. Significantly advances state-of-the-art in image morphing.

The proposed DiffMorpher effectively addresses the challenging problem of enabling smooth interpolations in diffusion models. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments verify the superiority of this approach.
