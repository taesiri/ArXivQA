# [Aerial Lifting: Neural Urban Semantic and Building Instance Lifting from   Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11812)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Accurate 3D semantic and instance-level segmentation of urban scenes from aerial images is challenging due to:
1) Significant object size variation (buildings, cars, roads), making 2D segmentation difficult. 
2) Noisy 2D labels predicted by existing methods suffer from multi-view inconsistency, especially for aerial images capturing only a small scene portion per image.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a neural radiance field (NeRF) approach that lifts noisy 2D labels predicted by off-the-shelf segmentation methods to optimize 3D semantic, instance and radiance fields without manual 3D annotation.

Key ideas:
1) Scale-adaptive semantic label fusion: Combines labels predicted from images rendered at different altitudes by NeRF leveraging better large object recognition from a distance. This handles object size variation.

2) Cross-view instance label grouping: Projects instance masks across views based on scene geometry to consolidate instances fragmented in individual views into coherent regions, addressing multi-view inconsistency.  

3) Multi-view stereo depth regularization: Uses depth maps from MVS to improve underlying geometry and in turn segmentation accuracy.

Main Contributions:
1) A NeRF approach for urban-scale semantic and building instance understanding from aerial images by lifting noisy 2D labels to 3D.

2) A scale-adaptive semantic label fusion strategy enhancing segmentation of varying sized objects using NeRF's novel view synthesis.

3) A cross-view instance label grouping approach leveraging the 3D scene representation to mitigate multi-view inconsistency of 2D instance labels.

Experiments on real urban datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the method's effectiveness.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents a neural radiance field (NeRF) method for urban-scale semantic and building-level instance segmentation from aerial images. The key idea is to lift noisy 2D labels predicted by off-the-shelf methods to 3D without requiring manual 3D annotations.

2) It introduces a scale-adaptive semantic label fusion strategy that combines labels predicted from different altitudes to enhance segmentation of objects of varying sizes, by leveraging NeRF's novel view synthesis capability. 

3) It presents a cross-view instance label grouping strategy to mitigate the multi-view inconsistency problem in 2D instance labels and provide more reliable supervision for building instance segmentation.
