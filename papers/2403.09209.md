# [LAN: Learning Adaptive Neighbors for Real-Time Insider Threat Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09209)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing insider threat detection (ITD) methods have two key limitations:
1) They detect threats at coarse levels like user, time period, or session level, requiring high investigation cost.  
2) They are post-hoc methods, unable to report threats in real-time before damage. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes LAN, an activity-level and real-time ITD framework with three key modules:

1) Activity Sequence Modeling: Employs LSTM to model temporal activity dependencies in a sequence and obtain preliminary activity representations.

2) Activity Graph Learning: Automatically constructs a dynamic activity graph via graph structure learning, without manual graph construction. Queries most related activities from all sequences to enhance representation of current activity.

3) Anomaly Score Prediction: Uses a graph neural network to aggregate information from related activities and predicts anomaly score based on enhanced representation. 

To address significant class imbalance, a novel hybrid loss is proposed integrating self-supervision from normal activities and supervision from limited abnormal activities.

Main Contributions:
1) First study on real-time ITD at activity level, enabling fine-grained and efficient threat detection.

2) Adaptive activity graph learning via structure learning instead of manual graph construction, enhancing activity representations. 

3) Hybrid loss combining self-supervision and supervision signals into a unified loss to alleviate data imbalance issue.

4) Extensive evaluation shows LAN outperforms 9 baselines by 9.92% and 6.35% in AUC on two datasets for real-time ITD. It also surpasses 8 methods by 7.70% and 4.03% in AUC for post-hoc ITD.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards advancing the state-of-the-art in insider threat detection through a novel activity-level and real-time framework with adaptive graph learning and a hybrid loss. Extensive empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
