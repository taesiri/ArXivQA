# Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding   Persona and Knowledge

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop conversational agents that can have more human-like, engaging, and knowledgeable dialogs by grounding their responses in both a user's persona (personal preferences and background) as well as factual knowledge?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Current conversational agents and datasets have limitations in generating customized and knowledgeable responses, as they do not comprehensively consider both a user's persona as well as factual knowledge.2) By creating a new dialog dataset (FoCus) where responses incorporate both persona information and factual knowledge, and training models on this dataset, it will be possible to develop more customized and knowledgeable conversational agents.3) The conversational abilities of current state-of-the-art models can be evaluated through automatic metrics as well as proposed persona and knowledge grounding subtasks on the FoCus dataset. This will demonstrate the need for models that can better fuse persona and knowledge to generate human-like responses.4) Human evaluation of model responses on the FoCus dataset will further demonstrate the gap between current models and human performance in generating engaging, consistent, and customized dialog.In summary, the central hypothesis is that grounding conversational responses in both persona and knowledge is key to more human-like dialog agents, and the FoCus dataset and associated tasks and evaluations aim to demonstrate and address these limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new dialog dataset called FoCus, which contains conversations with customized responses that incorporate both persona information and knowledge grounded in Wikipedia articles. Some key aspects of the FoCus dataset:- It contains 14,452 dialogs with 173,424 utterances, where the responses consider both the persona of the human speaker as well as factual knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia about geographical landmarks. - The dialogs involve an information-seeking task where the human asks questions about a landmark, and the machine provides informative and customized responses by utilizing the human's persona and Wikipedia knowledge about the landmark.- The responses are categorized into three types based on their intent: Inform (fact-based), Confirm (using persona), and Suggest (recommending based on persona).- Baseline generative models like GPT-2 and BART are trained on the dataset and evaluated both on generation fluency/accuracy as well as grounding abilities through proposed persona grounding and knowledge grounding subtasks.- Human evaluations are conducted to assess the naturalness and engagingness of model responses compared to human responses. The models still fall short of human performance.In summary, the key contribution is creating a new dialog dataset that requires integrating both persona and knowledge to generate informative and customized responses, along with benchmarking state-of-the-art models on it. This can enable building more intelligent conversational agents that can provide customized and knowledgeable responses.

The guidelines aim to standardize the submission format.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of conversational AI:- The focus on grounding both persona and knowledge in dialog responses is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on grounding either persona (e.g. personalizing responses) or knowledge, but not both together. This paper introduces a new dataset and models that aim to do both.- The FoCus dataset itself appears to be one of the first conversational datasets that contains responses grounded in both persona and knowledge. Other large-scale conversational datasets tend to focus on only one of these. For example, PersonaChat contains persona but not knowledge grounding, while Wizard of Wikipedia has knowledge grounding but no personas.- The model architectures proposed, using transformers and multi-task learning for generation, persona grounding, and knowledge grounding, seem pretty standard compared to other recent work. However, applying this type of model to the new FoCus dataset is an interesting contribution.- Overall, the focus on customizable and knowledgeable conversation by grounding both persona and knowledge appears to push forward the state of the art. Most prior work has focused on these areas separately. Evaluating both automatic metrics and human judgments also follows best practices in conversational AI compared to work that uses only one type of evaluation.In summary, the novel dataset and focus on customizable knowledgeable conversation differentiates this paper from prior work. The models and architectures are relatively standard, but their application to this new dataset is an interesting contribution. The comprehensive automatic and human evaluations also follow current best practices in the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more sophisticated models for knowledge grounding that can better fuse persona and knowledge together in a coherent way. The authors note limitations of the current models in properly integrating persona and knowledge, suggesting more advanced models are needed.- Exploring different persona representations beyond just sentences, such as graphs or profiles, that could capture persona information more comprehensively.- Collecting datasets with even more diversity in topics and personas to support more customizable and wide-ranging conversations.- Annotating the dialogs with intent types to allow models to better understand the purpose of each utterance during generation.- Evaluating the models in downstream tasks and real-world settings, beyond just the automatic metrics and human evaluations done in this paper. - Developing reinforcement learning or adversarial training techniques to further improve the quality and consistency of the generated dialogs.- Incorporating additional modalities like images to ground conversations in a multimodal context.Overall, the authors highlight the need for more research into developing models that can have truly intelligent, customized, and knowledgeable conversations. The FoCus dataset provides a solid starting point, but there are many opportunities to build upon this work to create more human-like conversational agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents the Call for Customized Conversation (FoCus) dataset, which contains dialogues where the machine's answers utilize both Wikipedia knowledge and information about the user's persona to generate customized and knowledgeable responses. The dataset contains 14,452 dialogues with an average of 12 turns per dialogue. The dialogues are collected via crowdworkers who are instructed to incorporate relevant Wikipedia knowledge and predefined persona sentences when generating the machine's utterances. Three types of customized machine responses are observed - Inform, Confirm, and Suggest. The paper proposes baseline generative models including transformer-based models and pre-trained models like GPT-2 and BART which are trained via a retrieval module to select relevant Wikipedia paragraphs and a dialog module to generate responses using multi-task learning for language modeling, persona grounding, and knowledge grounding. Automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate the models' generation abilities but limited grounding capabilities compared to human responses. Two sub-tasks of persona grounding and knowledge grounding are introduced to quantitatively evaluate the models' ability to ground responses in the appropriate persona sentences and knowledge. Overall, the FoCus dataset enables research into building conversational agents that can provide knowledgeable and customized responses to users.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a new dataset called \textit{call For Customized conversation} (FoCus) that contains dialogs with customized responses based on both the user's persona and relevant knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia. The goal is to build conversational agents that can provide informative yet personalized responses by fusing persona and knowledge. The dataset contains 14,452 dialogs with 173,424 utterances grounded in Wikipedia articles on geographical landmarks. Each dialog has a defined user persona and uses information from the Wikipedia article to generate the agent's responses. The paper proposes baseline generative models including transformer-based models and pre-trained models like GPT-2 and BART. The models are trained using a retrieval module to find relevant Wikipedia passages and a dialog module that takes into account the retrieved knowledge, user persona, and dialog history to generate responses. In addition to language modeling, the models are trained on two proposed subtasks - persona grounding and knowledge grounding - to evaluate how well they incorporate the relevant persona and knowledge into the response. Experiments show the models can achieve good performance on response generation, but higher generation scores do not necessarily correlate with better grounding abilities. Overall, the new FoCus dataset provides a way to build and evaluate conversational agents that can provide knowledgeable yet customized responses.
