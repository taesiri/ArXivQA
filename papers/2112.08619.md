# [Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding   Persona and Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08619)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we develop conversational agents that can have more human-like, engaging, and knowledgeable dialogs by grounding their responses in both a user's persona (personal preferences and background) as well as factual knowledge?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Current conversational agents and datasets have limitations in generating customized and knowledgeable responses, as they do not comprehensively consider both a user's persona as well as factual knowledge.

2) By creating a new dialog dataset (FoCus) where responses incorporate both persona information and factual knowledge, and training models on this dataset, it will be possible to develop more customized and knowledgeable conversational agents.

3) The conversational abilities of current state-of-the-art models can be evaluated through automatic metrics as well as proposed persona and knowledge grounding subtasks on the FoCus dataset. This will demonstrate the need for models that can better fuse persona and knowledge to generate human-like responses.

4) Human evaluation of model responses on the FoCus dataset will further demonstrate the gap between current models and human performance in generating engaging, consistent, and customized dialog.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that grounding conversational responses in both persona and knowledge is key to more human-like dialog agents, and the FoCus dataset and associated tasks and evaluations aim to demonstrate and address these limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new dialog dataset called FoCus, which contains conversations with customized responses that incorporate both persona information and knowledge grounded in Wikipedia articles. Some key aspects of the FoCus dataset:

- It contains 14,452 dialogs with 173,424 utterances, where the responses consider both the persona of the human speaker as well as factual knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia about geographical landmarks. 

- The dialogs involve an information-seeking task where the human asks questions about a landmark, and the machine provides informative and customized responses by utilizing the human's persona and Wikipedia knowledge about the landmark.

- The responses are categorized into three types based on their intent: Inform (fact-based), Confirm (using persona), and Suggest (recommending based on persona).

- Baseline generative models like GPT-2 and BART are trained on the dataset and evaluated both on generation fluency/accuracy as well as grounding abilities through proposed persona grounding and knowledge grounding subtasks.

- Human evaluations are conducted to assess the naturalness and engagingness of model responses compared to human responses. The models still fall short of human performance.

In summary, the key contribution is creating a new dialog dataset that requires integrating both persona and knowledge to generate informative and customized responses, along with benchmarking state-of-the-art models on it. This can enable building more intelligent conversational agents that can provide customized and knowledgeable responses.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of conversational AI:

- The focus on grounding both persona and knowledge in dialog responses is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on grounding either persona (e.g. personalizing responses) or knowledge, but not both together. This paper introduces a new dataset and models that aim to do both.

- The FoCus dataset itself appears to be one of the first conversational datasets that contains responses grounded in both persona and knowledge. Other large-scale conversational datasets tend to focus on only one of these. For example, PersonaChat contains persona but not knowledge grounding, while Wizard of Wikipedia has knowledge grounding but no personas.

- The model architectures proposed, using transformers and multi-task learning for generation, persona grounding, and knowledge grounding, seem pretty standard compared to other recent work. However, applying this type of model to the new FoCus dataset is an interesting contribution.

- Overall, the focus on customizable and knowledgeable conversation by grounding both persona and knowledge appears to push forward the state of the art. Most prior work has focused on these areas separately. Evaluating both automatic metrics and human judgments also follows best practices in conversational AI compared to work that uses only one type of evaluation.

In summary, the novel dataset and focus on customizable knowledgeable conversation differentiates this paper from prior work. The models and architectures are relatively standard, but their application to this new dataset is an interesting contribution. The comprehensive automatic and human evaluations also follow current best practices in the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more sophisticated models for knowledge grounding that can better fuse persona and knowledge together in a coherent way. The authors note limitations of the current models in properly integrating persona and knowledge, suggesting more advanced models are needed.

- Exploring different persona representations beyond just sentences, such as graphs or profiles, that could capture persona information more comprehensively.

- Collecting datasets with even more diversity in topics and personas to support more customizable and wide-ranging conversations.

- Annotating the dialogs with intent types to allow models to better understand the purpose of each utterance during generation.

- Evaluating the models in downstream tasks and real-world settings, beyond just the automatic metrics and human evaluations done in this paper. 

- Developing reinforcement learning or adversarial training techniques to further improve the quality and consistency of the generated dialogs.

- Incorporating additional modalities like images to ground conversations in a multimodal context.

Overall, the authors highlight the need for more research into developing models that can have truly intelligent, customized, and knowledgeable conversations. The FoCus dataset provides a solid starting point, but there are many opportunities to build upon this work to create more human-like conversational agents.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents the Call for Customized Conversation (FoCus) dataset, which contains dialogues where the machine's answers utilize both Wikipedia knowledge and information about the user's persona to generate customized and knowledgeable responses. The dataset contains 14,452 dialogues with an average of 12 turns per dialogue. The dialogues are collected via crowdworkers who are instructed to incorporate relevant Wikipedia knowledge and predefined persona sentences when generating the machine's utterances. Three types of customized machine responses are observed - Inform, Confirm, and Suggest. The paper proposes baseline generative models including transformer-based models and pre-trained models like GPT-2 and BART which are trained via a retrieval module to select relevant Wikipedia paragraphs and a dialog module to generate responses using multi-task learning for language modeling, persona grounding, and knowledge grounding. Automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate the models' generation abilities but limited grounding capabilities compared to human responses. Two sub-tasks of persona grounding and knowledge grounding are introduced to quantitatively evaluate the models' ability to ground responses in the appropriate persona sentences and knowledge. Overall, the FoCus dataset enables research into building conversational agents that can provide knowledgeable and customized responses to users.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset called \textit{call For Customized conversation} (FoCus) that contains dialogs with customized responses based on both the user's persona and relevant knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia. The goal is to build conversational agents that can provide informative yet personalized responses by fusing persona and knowledge. The dataset contains 14,452 dialogs with 173,424 utterances grounded in Wikipedia articles on geographical landmarks. Each dialog has a defined user persona and uses information from the Wikipedia article to generate the agent's responses. 

The paper proposes baseline generative models including transformer-based models and pre-trained models like GPT-2 and BART. The models are trained using a retrieval module to find relevant Wikipedia passages and a dialog module that takes into account the retrieved knowledge, user persona, and dialog history to generate responses. In addition to language modeling, the models are trained on two proposed subtasks - persona grounding and knowledge grounding - to evaluate how well they incorporate the relevant persona and knowledge into the response. Experiments show the models can achieve good performance on response generation, but higher generation scores do not necessarily correlate with better grounding abilities. Overall, the new FoCus dataset provides a way to build and evaluate conversational agents that can provide knowledgeable yet customized responses.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents the Call for Customized Conversation (FoCus) dataset, where the conversational agent's responses are grounded in both Wikipedia knowledge and the persona of the human in the conversation. The key method is the data collection process, where crowdworkers take on alternating roles of human and machine to produce natural conversations. The crowdworkers create personas based on keywords extracted from Wikipedia articles on landmarks, then conduct multi-turn conversations where the machine provides informative responses using the persona and Wikipedia knowledge. 

To evaluate models trained on FoCus, the authors propose two subtasks - persona grounding and knowledge grounding - to test whether the model can select the appropriate persona sentences and Wikipedia sentences to construct the response. They train several baseline generative models, including GPT-2 and BART variants, in a multi-task setting with language modeling, persona grounding, and knowledge grounding objectives. The models are evaluated both automatically using perplexity, BLEU, etc. and via human evaluation of fluency, consistency and engagement. Results show the models can achieve high performance on generation metrics but struggle with properly grounding responses, indicating limitations in their ability to customize conversation. Overall, the key method is using a custom data collection procedure to obtain human conversations grounded in persona and knowledge, along with proposing evaluation subtasks to directly test grounding abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be presenting a new dataset called "Call for Customized Conversation" (FoCus) for training conversational agents. The key problem it is trying to address is the lack of existing datasets and models that can generate knowledgeable and customized conversational responses by fusing both persona information and external knowledge. 

Some of the key questions and goals of the paper seem to be:

- How can we create a dataset that contains conversations where the responses utilize both persona information and factual knowledge?

- How can we build models that can effectively leverage this type of dataset to generate informative and personalized conversational responses? 

- How can we evaluate the ability of models to appropriately ground their responses in the provided persona information and knowledge?

The authors argue that existing datasets and models fail to produce conversational responses that are both customized to the user's persona/preferences and grounded in factual knowledge. Their proposed FoCus dataset aims to provide conversational examples that fuse persona and knowledge so models can learn to generate such customized and knowledgeable responses.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Call for Customized Conversation (FoCus) dataset: The paper introduces a new dialog dataset called FoCus that contains customized responses using persona information and Wikipedia knowledge.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new model called FoCus for generating customized conversations by grounding both persona and knowledge. Could you explain in more detail how the persona and knowledge grounding modules work and how they are integrated into the overall model architecture? 

2. The knowledge retrieval module uses TF-IDF to select relevant paragraphs from the Wikipedia documents. Did you experiment with other retrieval methods like BM25 or neural methods? How do the different retrieval methods compare in terms of relevance of retrieved passages?

3. The persona grounding module chooses relevant persona sentences from a set of candidates. How many persona sentence candidates are provided per turn during training? Does increasing the number of distracting candidates improve the model's ability to choose the correct persona sentences?

4. The knowledge grounding module also selects the correct knowledge sentence from a set of candidates. How are the distracting candidates generated during training? Does using more difficult negative candidates (e.g. from the same domain) improve knowledge grounding performance?

5. You propose persona grounding (PG) and knowledge grounding (KG) sub-tasks to evaluate the model's ability to choose the correct persona and knowledge. Why are these grounding sub-tasks important for building good conversational agents?

6. The model is trained with a multi-task objective combining language modeling, PG, and KG losses. How sensitive is the model to the weights of these different losses? Did you perform any hyperparameter search or optimization for these weights? 

7. The human evaluation results show the model still lags behind human performance. What are the major weaknesses you observed qualitatively in the model's generations? How can the model be improved to reach human-level performance?

8. Did you study the impact of the amount of persona versus knowledge grounding on dialog coherence, engagement and consistency? Does more persona grounding lead to more engaging conversations?

9. You focused on landmarks as the domain for knowledge grounding in this work. How difficult would it be to adapt the approach to other domains like movies, sports, etc? Would the model need to be retrained or could it generalize?

10. Have you considered personalizing the model to specific users by conditioning it on a user's full persona during inference rather than randomly sampling persona sentences? Could this allow for more consistent and customized conversations?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces a new conversational dataset called FoCus (call For Customized conversation) which contains dialogues where the answers utilize both Wikipedia knowledge and speaker persona information. The goal is to generate more knowledgeable and engaging responses by grounding them in relevant knowledge while also adapting to the speaker's interests and background. The dataset contains 14,452 multi-turn dialogues about geographical landmarks, with persona sentences built from keywords in the corresponding Wikipedia pages. The dialogues include customized answers fused with both knowledge and persona. Models like GPT-2 and BART are trained on FoCus with multi-task learning for language modeling, persona grounding, and knowledge grounding. Experiments show the models can generate fluent and customized responses, but human evaluation reveals they are not as high-quality as human-generated dialogues in the dataset. The paper also proposes persona grounding and knowledge grounding sub-tasks to evaluate how well models select the appropriate persona sentences and knowledge to ground their responses. Overall, FoCus represents a new challenging dataset to spur progress in generating informative, customized conversational responses.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a new dataset called FoCus for building conversational agents that can generate customized responses by grounding both persona information and knowledge.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dialog dataset called the call For Customized conversation (FoCus) dataset. The dataset contains conversational dialogs where the responses incorporate both persona information about the user as well as factual knowledge retrieved from Wikipedia articles about geographical landmarks. The dataset was constructed by crowdworkers who created persona profiles and then had simulated conversations where they alternated asking questions as the "human" and providing answers as the "machine". The answers from the machine combine relevant facts from the Wikipedia articles with references to the persona profile in order to provide customized and engaging responses. For example, if the persona likes birds, the response about a park may mention the different bird species found there. The authors trained several baseline neural conversational models on the dataset, including GPT-2 and BART, and evaluated their ability to generate relevant responses and ground them in the persona profiles and knowledge documents through both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The dataset provides a new challenging testbed for developing conversational agents that can provide knowledgeable and customized responses to users.
