# [InstructBooth: Instruction-following Personalized Text-to-Image   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing methods for personalizing text-to-image models using a few images of a specific subject often struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the textual context. For example, fine-tuning models like DreamBooth can enable them to generate new images of a given object, but the generated images frequently fail to match desired actions or contexts described in textual prompts. This is due to overfitting on the small set of training images.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper introduces InstructBooth, a novel two-stage approach to enhance image-text alignment for personalized text-to-image generation. 

1) Personalization: First, it utilizes the DreamBooth method to personalize a text-to-image model by fine-tuning with a unique identifier and few images of a subject. To better capture rare/novel subjects, detailed text descriptions are added.

2) RL Fine-Tuning: Subsequently, it further fine-tunes the model using reinforcement learning to maximize a reward related to image-text alignment. This step mitigates overfitting and improves contextual diversity. Carefully designed prompts with/without identifiers are used.

Main Contributions:
- A new two-stage approach combining personalization and RL fine-tuning to enhance both subject fidelity and text fidelity of personalized text-to-image models.

- Introducing detailed text descriptions and prompts with/without identifiers to improve personalization and RL training.

- Quantitative and human evaluations demonstrating superior image-text alignment over baselines like DreamBooth, while maintaining subject fidelity. Images from InstructBooth are preferred 4x more frequently considering all relevant quality factors.
