# [Foundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Foundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey":

Problem:
Time series analysis is crucial for extracting insights from temporal data across domains like finance, healthcare, and environment. Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs), which are large pre-trained deep learning models, have revolutionized many fields. However, existing surveys on FMs for time series analysis have focused on either applications or methodology without a comprehensive understanding of why/how FMs benefit time series tasks.

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey on foundation models tailored for time series from a methodology perspective. It categorizes time series into standard, spatial, and others (trajectory, event). The taxonomy analyzes FMs across four key aspects - architecture, pre-training, adaptation, and data modalities. 

Architectures covered include Transformer, non-Transformer, and diffusion models. Pre-training methods involve supervised, self-supervised (contrastive, generative), and hybrid techniques to equip models with broad temporal knowledge. Adaptation strategies like prompt engineering and fine-tuning enable customization. Both single and multiple modalities are surveyed.  

Contributions:

- Comprehensive up-to-date survey on foundation models spanning diverse time series types 

- Novel taxonomy offering an in-depth analysis of mechanisms driving FM efficacy in time series

- Highlights architectural designs, pre-training objectives, adaptation methods to elucidate their roles

- Discusses both single and multiple data modalities used to construct versatile time series FMs

- Identifies open challenges and future directions to advance research on foundation models for time series analysis

The summary covers the key problem being addressed, the proposed methodology-centric taxonomy to systematically analyze time series foundation models, and the main contributions that enhance understanding of how and why these models are effective for time series tasks. It also points out avenues for future work.
