# [SO-NeRF: Active View Planning for NeRF using Surrogate Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03266)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Surrogate Objectives for Active Radiance Fields (SOAR), a set of interpretable functions to evaluate the goodness of views for training neural radiance fields (NeRF) models. The functions - surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and ray diversity - correspond to physical scene qualities that impact NeRF reconstruction quality. To enable efficient computation of these objectives, the authors propose SOARNet, a neural network that scores unseen camera poses in seconds without needing to visit the poses or train any radiance field. Using these scores, the method performs greedy view planning that optimizes for the SOAR objectives in an interleaved manner. Experiments demonstrate that trajectories from SOARNet yield better or comparable NeRF reconstruction quality to prior methods while being over 80x faster. The method generalizes across fully neural-implicit and explicit radiance field representations. Overall, SOAR provides an efficient and interpretable way to actively plan good views for training performant NeRF models without needing in-flight training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a set of interpretable objectives for evaluating camera views to enable efficient active view planning for neural radiance fields without needing to train any such model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a set of surrogate objectives (SOAR) to characterize informative samples for training radiance fields models. These objectives correspond to physical qualities like surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and ray diversity, making them intuitive and explainable. 

2. Devising a neural network called SOARNet that can efficiently compute these objective scores, enabling per-step planning in under 1 second on unseen poses. This allows generating trajectories in seconds instead of hours.

3. Providing an alternative training-free approach to estimating the goodness of a radiance field model with respect to the input data.

4. Releasing the code and data for reproducibility.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the SOAR objectives along with the SOARNet model to enable fast, intuitive, and efficient view planning for radiance fields without needing to train the actual radiance field model. This makes it model-agnostic and results in significant speedups.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a set of "surrogate objectives" to characterize good views for training radiance fields - surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and ray diversity. Can you elaborate on how each of these objectives is mathematically formulated and why they provide useful signals?

2. The SOARNet model is introduced to efficiently compute the surrogate objective scores. Can you walk through the architecture and key components of SOARNet? How does it leverage both image features and camera pose information? 

3. The overall pipeline greedily selects the next best view by picking the camera candidate that maximizes the desired surrogate objective at each step in an interleaving manner. Why is this greedy strategy effective and how does the objective sequence balance different criteria?

4. Pseudo-coverage initialization is used to provide good coverage during early steps when information is minimal. How is this initialization scheme designed and why is coverage particularly important early on? 

5. How does the proposed method account for over-emphasis on certain complex local regions or repetitive textures during view planning? Explain the use of discount factors.  

6. What loss functions are used to train the SOARNet model? How are the predictions for seen vs unseen views handled?

7. The method claims to work across radiance field model variants from implicit to explicit approaches. What evidence is provided to validate this model-agnostic capability?

8. What are the key advantages of using prescriptive surrogate objectives over probabilistic uncertainty estimates for view planning? How does this impact practical usage?

9. The experiments compare against ActiveNeRF baselines on NeRF Synthetic and custom Objaverse datasets. Summarize the relative performance, especially reconstruction quality and time tradeoffs.  

10. While promising results are shown on single object datasets, what are some challenges and limitations when applying this active perception approach to more complex real-world environments?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "SO-NeRF: Active View Planning for NeRF using Surrogate Objectives":

Problem:
- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become popular for novel view synthesis, but require capturing dense images from many viewpoints around an object or scene. 
- However, the process of determining good views for training NeRF remains vague, with only a general rule of thumb of "sampling as densely as possible". 
- This makes it difficult to actively plan optimal sequences of views that maximize reconstruction quality.
- Existing active view planning methods have limitations like needing to train NeRF models during planning, not being interpretable, or too simplistic.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Surrogate Objectives for Active Radiance Fields (SOAR), which are intuitive and interpretable functions for evaluating goodness of views. 
- SOAR consists of 4 objectives - surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and ray diversity.
- To enable efficient computation, a neural network called SOARNet is proposed to predict SOAR scores.
- A simple greedy view planning approach uses SOARNet to pick the best next view based on maximizing one SOAR objective per step.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes set of intuitive, interpretable objectives (SOAR) to indicate goodness of views for training radiance fields.
- SOARNet enables efficient inference of SOAR scores for view planning, without needing to train radiance fields.
- Overall approach is model-agnostic and works across different radiance field methods.  
- Experiments show the approach outperforms baselines like ActiveNeRF, with ~80x speedup and better/comparable reconstruction quality.
- Provides interpretable way to evaluate goodness of radiance field model wrt input views.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient and interpretable active view planning approach for neural radiance fields using surrogate objectives that quantify geometric and photometric properties of views. This enables intelligent view planning without expensive radiance field training.
