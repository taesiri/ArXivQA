# [SO-NeRF: Active View Planning for NeRF using Surrogate Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03266)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Surrogate Objectives for Active Radiance Fields (SOAR), a set of interpretable functions to evaluate the goodness of views for training neural radiance fields (NeRF) models. The functions - surface coverage, geometric complexity, textural complexity, and ray diversity - correspond to physical scene qualities that impact NeRF reconstruction quality. To enable efficient computation of these objectives, the authors propose SOARNet, a neural network that scores unseen camera poses in seconds without needing to visit the poses or train any radiance field. Using these scores, the method performs greedy view planning that optimizes for the SOAR objectives in an interleaved manner. Experiments demonstrate that trajectories from SOARNet yield better or comparable NeRF reconstruction quality to prior methods while being over 80x faster. The method generalizes across fully neural-implicit and explicit radiance field representations. Overall, SOAR provides an efficient and interpretable way to actively plan good views for training performant NeRF models without needing in-flight training.
