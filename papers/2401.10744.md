## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Financial analysis relies on complex numerical reasoning across financial reports, requiring intricate manual data annotation for training question-answering models. This leads to high expenses and data scarcity issues.  

Proposed Solution - FinLLMs Framework
- Collect and format common financial formulas into a graph structure based on variable dependencies 
- Augment the formula set by combining formulas sharing variables using graph traversal  
- Use GPT-3.5 to generate tabular and textual financial data adhering to the formulas 
- Format the data into question-answer pairs to train financial QA models

Key Contributions:
- Novel framework to automatically create financial QA datasets based on formulas to address data scarcity
- Graph traversal technique to expand limited manually collected formulas into larger augmented formula set  
- Experiments showing FinLLMs data improves performance of FinQANet and DyRRen over human-labeled FinQA and TAT-QA datasets
- Analysis of data distribution, case studies and error analysis providing insights into data quality
- Highlighted challenges around distribution shifts, gold statement selection, privacy risks and debates of using AI-generated data

In summary, FinLLMs is a new framework to generate synthetic financial question-answering data using formulas and language models to help address the expenses and scarcity of human-labeled data for this domain. Experiments demonstrate usefulness but challenges remain around distribution shifts and privacy.
