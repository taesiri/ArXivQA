# [Decomposable Submodular Maximization in Federated Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00138)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of maximizing a decomposable submodular function subject to constraints in a federated setting:
$max_{S\in \mathcal{I}} \{F(S) = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i f_i(S)\}$
where $f_i$'s are monotone submodular functions corresponding to $N$ clients, $\mathcal{I}$ encodes constraints like cardinality, and $p_i$'s denote client weights.  Decomposable submodular maximization has important ML applications but poses privacy, communication, and computation challenges in a federated setting.

Proposed Solution - FedCG Algorithm:
The paper proposes a novel Federated Continuous Greedy (\textsc{Fed}CG) algorithm that builds upon the centralized continuous greedy algorithm. \textsc{Fed}CG proceeds in rounds - server broadcasts current model to sampled clients, clients take greedy steps based on local functions and send update directions using secure aggregation, server aggregates updates to get new model. Under bounded heterogeneity assumption, \textsc{Fed}CG guarantees $(1-1/e)$ approximation using only $~O(1)$ communication from each client per round even with client sampling and local computation.

Extensions:
\textsc{Fed}CG+ further reduces communication by having more local greedy steps between rounds. A variant using intermittent discrete updates rather than continuous directions is also proposed for discrete problems like facility location and maximum coverage. 

Main Contributions:
- First algorithm for submodular maximization in federated setting with optimal $(1-1/e)$ guarantee
- Rigorous analysis bounding effects of heterogeneity, client sampling
- Low per-client communication $~O(1)$ bits per round  
- Validation on discrete problems like facility location and maximum coverage
- Potential for several ML and optimization applications needing privacy-preserving collaborative optimization

The paper makes an important contribution in introducing submodular optimization to the federated setting while preserving theoretical guarantees. The proposed algorithms and analysis open up applications in areas like personalized recommendation and welfare maximization where agent privacy is important.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a federated optimization algorithm called Federated Continuous Greedy (FedCG) for maximizing decomposable submodular functions subject to matroid constraints that achieves near optimal approximation guarantees while ensuring privacy, low communication costs, and robustness to client heterogeneity and intermittent availability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes the first federated (constrained) submodular maximization algorithm called Federated Continuous Greedy (\texttt{\textsc{Fed}CG}) that achieves near optimal approximation guarantees under mild assumptions, even with client sampling and low communication rounds.

2) It analyzes the convergence and approximation guarantees of \texttt{\textsc{Fed}CG} under different practical scenarios relevant to the federated setting, such as partial client participation, low communication rounds, bit complexity constraints, etc.

3) It introduces a variant called Practical FedCG (\texttt{\textsc{Fed}CG+}) that further reduces communication rounds between server and clients by allowing local computation.

4) It provides rigorous theoretical analysis on the convergence and approximation guarantees of the proposed algorithms under different federated constraints.

5) It shows how the federated optimization framework can be incorporated to solve fundamental discrete submodular maximization problems such as Facility Location and Maximum Coverage.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first decentralized submodular maximization algorithms for the federated setting, along with theoretical analysis on their convergence guarantees while accounting for practical constraints faced in real-world federated applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the federated submodular maximization method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed federated continuous greedy (\texttt{FedCG}) algorithm balance providing strong theoretical guarantees like the centralized continuous greedy algorithm while also addressing challenges of the federated setting like privacy preservation and communication efficiency?

2. Assumption 1 about bounded gradient differences seems crucial for the analysis of \texttt{FedCG}. Can you discuss how reasonable this assumption is for different applications of submodular maximization and whether any relaxations of it are possible? 

3. Could you explain the intuition behind why analyzing the convergence and approximation guarantees of \texttt{FedCG} requires bounding the difference between the centralized greedy direction $\mb{v}$ and the averaged client directions $\bar{\mb{v}}$? 

4. How does the practical \texttt{FedCG+} algorithm address the tradeoff between allowing more local computation on clients to reduce communication versus controlling the accumulation of error from those local steps?

5. Could you discuss the benefits and potential limitations of using a discrete greedy approach like Algorithm 3 for federated submodular maximization compared to the continuous relaxation approach of \texttt{FedCG}?

6. For applications like facility location and maximum coverage, what efficiency or privacy benefits does the randomized response approach in Algorithm 3 provide over just using secure aggregation?

7. How do computational constraints on client devices impact designing algorithms for federated optimization of complex non-convex functions like submodular maximization?

8. What open questions remain in providing formal privacy guarantees for federated submodular maximization algorithms, e.g. using differential privacy or secure multi-party computation?

9. How do the theoretical guarantees for \texttt{FedCG} compare to related work on decentralized submodular maximization or federated optimization of other non-convex problems?

10. What are some promising real-world applications where a federated approach could enable large-scale submodular maximization that is otherwise computationally infeasible or raises privacy concerns in a centralized setting?
