# [Making Large Language Models Better Reasoners with Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02144)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by addressing the assessment misalignment problem caused by traditional fine-tuning methods?

Specifically, the key hypotheses are:

1) Traditional fine-tuning methods like maximum likelihood estimation cause LLMs to suffer from an "assessment misalignment" problem, where they struggle to properly assess the quality of different reasoning chains of thought (COTs). This hinders their reasoning abilities.

2) By using an alignment fine-tuning (AFT) approach with a novel constraint alignment loss, we can calibrate the scores LLMs assign to positive and negative COTs. This helps address the assessment misalignment issue and improves LLMs' reasoning abilities. 

3) Explicitly constraining the decrease of scores for negative examples is crucial for alignment losses to prevent model degradation. Prior ranking-based alignment methods overlook this constraint.

So in summary, the central research aim is to enhance LLMs' reasoning skills by tackling the assessment misalignment problem using the proposed alignment fine-tuning technique with constraints. The key hypothesis is that this approach will calibrate LLM scoring and lead to better reasoning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies an "assessment misalignment" problem with vanilla fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), where the LLMs struggle to properly assess the quality of different reasoning chains of thought (COTs) for a given question. 

2. It proposes a new "alignment fine-tuning" (AFT) paradigm to address this problem and improve LLM reasoning abilities. The key steps of AFT are:

(a) Fine-tune the LLM on COT training data. 

(b) Generate multiple COT responses for each question using the fine-tuned LLM. Categorize them as positive/negative based on whether they deduce the correct answer.

(c) Calibrate the scores of positive and negative responses using a novel "constraint alignment" loss function. This aligns model assessments with ground truth quality assessments.

3. The constraint alignment loss contains two key components:

(a) An alignment term that ensures positive scores are higher than negative scores. 

(b) A constraint term that prevents excessive reduction of negative scores to avoid model degradation.

4. The AFT paradigm and constraint alignment loss are shown to improve reasoning performance over vanilla fine-tuning baselines on multiple benchmarks.

5. The paper also analyzes limitations of prior ranking-based alignment methods, and shows the importance of the constraint term for achieving good performance.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing AFT with constraint alignment as an effective technique to improve LLM reasoning abilities by addressing assessment misalignments caused by traditional fine-tuning approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is my summary and assessment of how this paper compares to other research in the field:

The paper presents a new method called Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) to improve reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

- Identifying an "assessment misalignment" problem in vanilla fine-tuned LLMs, where they struggle to properly assess the quality of different reasoning chains. 

- Proposing a 3-step AFT process: 1) Fine-tune on reasoning data 2) Generate candidate reasoning chains and label as positive/negative 3) Calibrate LLM scores on positive/negative chains using a novel constraint alignment loss.

- The constraint alignment loss aims to ensure positive scores are higher than negative scores (alignment) while preventing excessive degradation of negative scores (constraint).

This approach of using alignment to improve reasoning is novel. Prior work on alignment (e.g. RLHF, DPO, PRO, RRHF) has focused more on safety and preference learning rather than reasoning abilities. The proposed constraint alignment loss also has advantages over previous ranking losses by explicitly preventing score degradation.

The experiments demonstrate clear improvements in reasoning accuracy over vanilla fine-tuning baselines. The method also outperforms concurrent work RFT that uses data augmentation to improve reasoning. This shows the benefits of explicit alignment over just using more data.  

Additionally, analyses reveal the importance of the proposed constraints for preventing performance drops compared to prior ranking-based alignment methods like RRHF and PRO. Case studies also intuitively show how alignment helps compared to degradation when removing constraints.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions demonstrating how alignment can enhance LLM reasoning. The proposed AFT paradigm and constraint alignment loss offer improvements over existing approaches. Key limitations are the lack of experiments on very large models and the need to tune the constraint strength. But the paper is solidly positioned among related works and empirically supports the value of alignment for reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the effectiveness of AFT on larger LLMs like 65B and 70B LLama models. The authors were limited to smaller models like 7B and 13B LLama due to resource constraints. Applying AFT to larger LLMs could further demonstrate its benefits.

- Developing methods to automatically learn the optimal boundary constraint hyperparameter β instead of manual tuning on a validation set. The authors suggest finding a dynamic way to set β without extra hyperparameters could improve the approach.

- Extending AFT to other types of reasoning tasks beyond the datasets tested. The authors focused on mathematical, commonsense, and scientific reasoning. Applying AFT more broadly could further highlight its versatility.

- Combining AFT with other methods like new prompting strategies to further improve reasoning. The authors suggest AFT could complement other advances like self-consistency prompting.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why AFT works and when it is most effective. The paper empirically shows AFT improves reasoning but does not provide formal theoretical analysis.

- Comparing AFT to other alignment techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback. The authors focus comparisons on supervised fine-tuning methods.

In summary, the key future directions center on scaling up AFT, automating and theoretically understanding it, and combining it with other methods to further enhance LLM reasoning abilities. The authors provide promising empirical results but suggest more research is needed to fully realize the potential of alignment fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a new alignment fine-tuning (AFT) method to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors find that vanilla fine-tuning of LLMs on chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning data leads to an assessment misalignment problem, where the models struggle to accurately evaluate the quality of different COTs. To address this, AFT incorporates a novel constraint alignment loss with two objectives - alignment, which ensures positive COT scores exceed negative scores, and constraint, which prevents negative COT scores from becoming too low. AFT first fine-tunes the LLMs on COT data, then generates multiple COT responses and categorizes them as positive or negative, and finally calibrates the scores using the constraint alignment loss. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks show AFT outperforms vanilla fine-tuning and a concurrent data augmentation method. The paper also analyzes recent ranking-based alignment methods and finds the constraint term has been overlooked but is crucial for performance. Overall, the paper demonstrates an effective alignment fine-tuning paradigm to enhance LLM reasoning abilities by properly assessing COT quality.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) to improve reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors find that vanilla fine-tuning of LLMs on reasoning data leads to an "assessment misalignment" problem - LLMs struggle to properly assess the quality of different reasoning chains for a given question. To address this, AFT has three main steps: 1) fine-tune LLMs on reasoning data, 2) generate multiple reasoning chains for each training question and categorize as positive or negative based on correctness, 3) calibrate the scores LLMs assign to positive and negative reasoning chains using a novel "constraint alignment" loss. This loss ensures positive scores are higher than negative scores, while also constraining negative scores to prevent model degradation. 

Beyond binary positive/negative feedback, the constraint alignment loss also works for ranking situations where a quality ranking of reasoning chains is available. The authors show the constraint term is important for other recent ranking-based alignment methods too. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks demonstrate AFT's effectiveness for improving reasoning and alignment, outperforming vanilla fine-tuning. AFT also shows strong multi-task and out-of-distribution performance. Key contributions are identifying the assessment misalignment issue with vanilla fine-tuning, proposing the intuitive three-step AFT paradigm to address it, and highlighting the importance of constraints for ranking-based alignment methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method called Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT) to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:

1) Vanilla fine-tuning (VFT) of LLMs on reasoning datasets causes an "assessment misalignment" problem - the models struggle to appropriately assess the quality of different reasoning chains for a given question. 

2) To address this, AFT first fine-tunes the LLM on reasoning data using VFT. Then it generates multiple reasoning chains (both correct and incorrect) for each training question using the fine-tuned LLM. 

3) It categorizes these reasoning chains into positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) groups. Then it calibrates the scores/probabilities assigned by the LLM to these groups using a novel "constraint alignment" loss. This loss ensures positive chains have higher scores than negative ones, while also preventing excessive score reductions for negative chains.

4) The constraint alignment loss can be adapted to utilize ranking feedback about reasoning chain quality, when available. This further enhances model performance.

In summary, AFT fine-tunes LLMs on reasoning data, then calibrates their internal assessments of reasoning chain quality using a constrained alignment loss over generated chains. This improves their reasoning abilities.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is trying to address is the lack of reasoning ability in large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

- LLMs still struggle with complex reasoning skills that are needed for artificial general intelligence. Recent work has shown that finetuning LLMs on data with chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning can improve their reasoning abilities. 

- However, the paper finds that LLMs fine-tuned on COT data suffer from an "assessment misalignment" problem - they frequently assign higher scores (lower perplexity) to subpar or incorrect COT reasoning chains compared to correct ones. 

- This indicates the fine-tuned LLMs still struggle to accurately assess the quality of different reasoning chains, limiting their reasoning capabilities. 

So in summary, the main problem is the inadequate reasoning skills of LLMs, especially the inability to properly evaluate the quality of different reasoning chains. The paper aims to improve LLM reasoning by addressing this assessment misalignment issue through a new training approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms are:

- Chain of thought (COT) reasoning - The paper focuses on training large language models (LLMs) using data with COT reasoning chains to improve their reasoning abilities. COT refers to explaining the reasoning process step-by-step to reach a conclusion.

- Assessment misalignment - The paper finds vanilla fine-tuned LLMs suffer from this problem where they struggle to accurately assess the quality of different COTs. This hinders their reasoning ability.

- Alignment fine-tuning (AFT) - The proposed training paradigm to address assessment misalignment. It involves fine-tuning on COT data, generating responses, categorizing as positive/negative, and calibrating scores using a constraint alignment loss.

- Constraint alignment loss - The novel loss function introduced in AFT. It has two components: alignment to ensure positive scores are higher than negative, and constraint to prevent negative scores from dropping too low.

- Binary feedback - Using binary labels of positive/negative COTs during AFT.

- Ranking feedback - A more advanced form of feedback used in AFT where full ranking of COT quality is available. The loss can be adapted to utilize this extra signal.

- Model degradation - The paper shows reducing scores of negative COTs without constraints can harm model performance during alignment. The constraint term helps prevent this.

In summary, the key focus is on using alignment to address assessment misalignment in chain of thought fine-tuned LLMs to improve their reasoning abilities. The proposed constraint alignment loss and adaptation to ranking feedback are novel contributions.
