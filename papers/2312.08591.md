# [Joint2Human: High-quality 3D Human Generation via Compact Spherical   Embedding of 3D Joints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08591)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Joint2Human, a novel method for efficiently generating high-quality 3D human models with both global structure fidelity and fine-grained local geometry details. The key idea is to leverage 2D diffusion models to directly produce 3D shapes using the Fourier Occupancy Field (FOF) representation. To guide the geometry generation, a compact spherical embedding of 3D joints is introduced to incorporate pose information without relying on parametric body models. Additionally, a high-frequency enhancer and multi-view recarving strategy are designed to further enrich details. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of Joint2Human in ensuring global consistency, preserving local details, achieving high resolution, and reducing computational costs simultaneously. The method also shows potential for conditional generation based on either poses or text. In summary, through compact joint encoding, detail enhancement, and direct 3D generation from 2D models, the proposed Joint2Human approach pushes the boundary of high-quality 3D human generation.
