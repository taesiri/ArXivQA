# [Democratizing Large Language Models via Personalized Parameter-Efficient   Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for personalizing large language models (LLMs) have limitations in model ownership and adapting to shifts in user behavior. Specifically, existing methods process personalization in a centralized way, limiting customization and privacy. They also struggle to generalize and adapt when a user's new behaviors do not closely match their historical patterns.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes "One PEFT Per User" (OPPU), where each user has a personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) module. The PEFT modules are trained on the user's history to capture their preferences and patterns. By plugging in a user's PEFT module, they can own and customize a private LLM adapted to them. OPPU also integrates the PEFT parametric personalization with non-parametric user knowledge from retrieval and profiles.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces personalized PEFT modules to ensure LLM ownership and better adapt to user behavior shifts
- Integrates parametric personalization via PEFT with non-parametric user knowledge for enhanced performance
- Achieves state-of-the-art results across all 7 tasks in the LaMP benchmark
- Demonstrates advantages in handling behavior shifts, modeling varying activity levels, robustness to history formats, and versatility across PEFT methods

The proposed OPPU framework pioneers PEFT-based personalization, enhancing modularity for effective and democratized adaptation of LLMs to individual users. It opens opportunities for personalized LLMs while addressing key limitations around ownership and behavior shifts.
