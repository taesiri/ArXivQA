# [Temporal Enhanced Training of Multi-view 3D Object Detector via   Historical Object Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00967)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we better leverage temporal information to improve multi-view 3D object detection?

The key hypothesis behind their proposed approach is that forcing the model to predict objects in historical frames, based on adjacent frames, will encourage it to learn better bird's eye view (BEV) features that capture both spatial and temporal information. This Historical Object Prediction (HoP) approach is proposed as a novel way to utilize temporal cues more effectively.

To summarize, the main research questions/hypotheses addressed are:

- Can predicting objects in historical frames, using only adjacent frames, improve multi-view 3D detection by encouraging better BEV feature learning? (HoP approach)

- How should the temporal decoder be designed to effectively generate pseudo BEV features for historical frames? (Proposed short-term and long-term branches)

- Can HoP complement and improve existing methods that leverage temporal information in other ways? (Evaluated on BEVFormer, BEVDet)

- Does explicitly supervising the historical object prediction with 3D labels lead to better performance compared to just predicting BEV features?

So in essence, the paper explores new ways to take advantage of temporal information in multi-view 3D detection, with a focus on the HoP training approach. The core hypothesis is that HoP can encourage more discriminative spatio-temporal BEV feature learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper seem to be:

1. Proposing a new paradigm called Historical Object Prediction (HoP) for multi-view 3D object detection. The key idea is to generate a pseudo BEV feature for a historical timestamp (t-k) using adjacent frames, and predict the object set at that timestamp using the pseudo feature. 

2. Designing a temporal decoder with short-term and long-term branches to provide spatial semantics and motion estimation respectively to reconstruct the historical BEV feature.

3. An additional lightweight object decoder is used to predict 3D objects on the reconstructed BEV feature.

4. Demonstrating the effectiveness of HoP by incorporating it into state-of-the-art detectors like BEVFormer and BEVDet. Experiments on nuScenes dataset show significant improvements in 3D detection performance.

5. The proposed HoP approach provides a new way to leverage temporal information in 3D detection without additional inference cost. It serves as an auxiliary task during training to enable more accurate BEV feature learning.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be proposing Historical Object Prediction to better utilize motion clues in adjacent frames for 3D detection in a plug-and-play manner. The experiments validate its effectiveness to boost performance of existing detectors.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new training paradigm called Historical Object Prediction (HoP) for multi-view 3D object detection, where the model predicts objects in historical frames using adjacent frames to learn better representations, without increasing inference cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on multi-view 3D object detection:

- The paper proposes a new training paradigm called Historical Object Prediction (HoP) to better leverage temporal information from multiple views. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like BEVDet4D, BEVStereo, and BEVFormer that focus more on fusing features or estimating depth for the current frame. 

- HoP generates pseudo BEV features and predicts objects for historical timestamps rather than just the current frame. This encourages the model to capture both spatial and temporal information during training. Other methods mainly leverage temporal cues for the current frame.

- HoP is designed as a plug-and-play module that can be added to existing BEV-based detectors like BEVFormer without changing the overall framework. This differs from methods like BEVDet4D that incorporate temporal modeling into specific components of the pipeline.

- The paper shows HoP improves performance over strong baselines like BEVFormer and BEVDet4D-Depth. The gains are complementary to other temporal fusion techniques, demonstrating the value of HoP's unique approach.

- HoP with ViT-L backbone achieves new state-of-the-art results on nuScenes test set, outperforming prior published methods by a large margin (+3.7% NDS over previous best). This shows the potential of the proposed training scheme.

In summary, the key novelty of this paper compared to prior work is the introduction of a historical object prediction task during training to better encode spatial-temporal information. The gains over strong baselines demonstrate this is an effective approach and complementary to existing temporal fusion techniques.
