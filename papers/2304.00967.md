# [Temporal Enhanced Training of Multi-view 3D Object Detector via   Historical Object Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00967)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we better leverage temporal information to improve multi-view 3D object detection?The key hypothesis behind their proposed approach is that forcing the model to predict objects in historical frames, based on adjacent frames, will encourage it to learn better bird's eye view (BEV) features that capture both spatial and temporal information. This Historical Object Prediction (HoP) approach is proposed as a novel way to utilize temporal cues more effectively.To summarize, the main research questions/hypotheses addressed are:- Can predicting objects in historical frames, using only adjacent frames, improve multi-view 3D detection by encouraging better BEV feature learning? (HoP approach)- How should the temporal decoder be designed to effectively generate pseudo BEV features for historical frames? (Proposed short-term and long-term branches)- Can HoP complement and improve existing methods that leverage temporal information in other ways? (Evaluated on BEVFormer, BEVDet)- Does explicitly supervising the historical object prediction with 3D labels lead to better performance compared to just predicting BEV features?So in essence, the paper explores new ways to take advantage of temporal information in multi-view 3D detection, with a focus on the HoP training approach. The core hypothesis is that HoP can encourage more discriminative spatio-temporal BEV feature learning.
