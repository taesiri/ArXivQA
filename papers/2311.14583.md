# [GPT Struct Me: Probing GPT Models on Narrative Entity Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14583)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper probes the capabilities of two state-of-the-art large language models, GPT-3 and ChatGPT, in extracting structured narrative information including events, participants, and temporal expressions from news articles in Portuguese. Through prompt engineering and preliminary experiments, the authors develop prompts tailored to each model that provide varying levels of contextual information. They apply these prompts to evaluate the models against baselines on a held-out test set from the Text2Story Lusa dataset of news articles with rich semantic annotations. The results show that while the models achieve competitive or superior performance to the baselines in extracting participants and temporal expressions, they lag behind in event extraction. The authors posit that this stems from events requiring more nuanced understanding aligned to annotation guidelines. Overall, the study offers insights into strengths and limitations of employing such models for narrative information extraction in a low-resource prompt-based learning paradigm, guiding future work on refining prompts and applying them to more complex extraction tasks across languages and domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper probes GPT-3 and ChatGPT models on their capability of extracting narrative entities (events, participants, time expressions) from news articles through optimized prompt engineering, finding that the models achieve competitive results to baseline systems on time expressions and participants, but underperform on event extraction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A prompt engineering methodology to evaluate large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT for extracting narrative entities from text using different levels of information to leverage their capabilities. 

2) A robust evaluation of GPT-3 and ChatGPT on the task of extracting narrative entities (events, participants, and temporal expressions) from European Portuguese news articles, using the developed prompt methodology. The results are compared to several baseline systems.

So in summary, the main contributions are:

- A systematic prompt methodology to evaluate LLMs on narrative entity extraction 
- An analysis of GPT-3 and ChatGPT's effectiveness on extracting events, participants and temporal expressions from Portuguese news, compared to baseline systems.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

narrative entity extraction, GPT models, prompt-base learning, events, participants, temporal expressions (timexs), Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), ChatGPT, prompt engineering, zero-shot learning, one-shot learning

The paper evaluates the capabilities of GPT-3 and ChatGPT models in extracting narrative entities (events, participants, and timexs) from news articles using a prompt-based learning approach. Different prompt templates are tested in an ablation study to identify the best prompts for each entity-model pair. The models are then evaluated and compared to baseline systems for entity extraction. The key terms reflect this focus on applying large language models to narrative information extraction using carefully constructed prompts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper conducts a prompt engineering methodology to evaluate LLMs. Could you elaborate on the different components of the prompt template and why each was chosen? How was the template iteratively improved?

2. The paper uses an ablation study to determine the best prompt components. What were the results of adding or removing different prompt components like the definition, classes, and examples? How did this differ across models and entities extracted?

3. The sampling methodology for choosing the preliminary test set is described in detail. What was the rationale behind this stratified sampling approach? How did it ensure the sample was representative of the entire corpus?

4. The paper compares the GPT models against several baseline systems. Could you expand on these baselines, how they work, and why they were chosen for comparison? What are the strengths and weaknesses of these baselines?

5. The results show GPT models outperformed baselines for timex and participant extraction but not events. What hypotheses do the authors provide to explain this? Do you think their explanations fully account for this difference?

6. The relaxed F1 metric is introduced to account for partial overlaps between predictions and ground truth. Could you explain this metric more fully? When would a partial overlap be considered correct and why is this evaluation approach useful?  

7. The authors note the results are not guaranteed to maximize GPT performance and discuss lack of reproducibility as a limitation. How could the prompting methodology be expanded to better optimize and control for consistency of outputs?

8. What role does the example statement play in the prompts? Does its inclusion confirm the author’s “chain of thought” hypotheses? How could additional examples or other content improve results?

9. The authors propose several promising future research directions, like evaluating more complex extraction tasks. Can you suggest additional complex narrative extraction tasks that would be worthwhile to explore with LLMs?

10. Beyond task performance, what other evaluation dimensions could reveal strengths and weaknesses of using LLMs for narrative extraction vs traditional methods? How should these be measured?
