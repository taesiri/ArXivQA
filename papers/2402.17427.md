# [VastGaussian: Vast 3D Gaussians for Large Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17427)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based methods for large scene reconstruction often produce results that lack details or render slowly. The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting works well on small-scale scenes but struggles to scale up to large environments due to limited video memory, long optimization times, and noticeable appearance variations across views. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes VastGaussian, the first method to enable high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering of large scenes based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. The key ideas are:

(1) Progressive scene partitioning: Divide the large scene into multiple cells using a camera position-based strategy. Distribute training views and points to each cell based on expanded boundaries. Further select additional relevant views and points using airspace-aware visibility calculations to supervise the airspace.

(2) Decoupled appearance modeling: Attach pixel-level appearance embeddings to rendered images and pass them through a CNN to generate a transformation map. Use the map to adjust rendered images to match appearance variations. This handles variations while allowing 3D Gaussians to learn consistent geometry and color. Discard module after optimization for fast rendering.  

(3) Parallel cell optimization and seamless merging: Optimize cells independently in parallel given smaller data sizes. Merge non-overlapping optimized cells to obtain a complete scene that exceeds the quality of reconstructing the entire scene directly.

Main Contributions:
(1) First method to enable high-fidelity and real-time rendering of large scenes with 3D Gaussian Splatting  
(2) Progressive partitioning strategy for optimizable cell creation and seamless merging
(3) Decoupled appearance modeling to reduce appearance variations and eliminate floaters

Experiments show superior quality and efficiency over leading NeRF methods on multiple datasets. The approach also enables flexible scalability and regional fine-tuning.
