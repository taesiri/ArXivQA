# [Seal-3D: Interactive Pixel-Level Editing for Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15131)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research focus of this paper is on developing an interactive pixel-level editing method for neural radiance fields (NeRF) that can enable fast and flexible editing of 3D scenes represented as NeRFs. Specifically, the paper aims to address two main challenges:1) The lack of direct correspondence between explicit editing instructions (e.g. on the pixel level) and updates to the implicit NeRF network parameters. 2) The non-locality of NeRF networks, which makes localized editing difficult without affecting the global scene structure.To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes:- A proxy function to map user edits from target space to source space and generate editing guidance via a teacher model.- A two-stage training strategy with local pretraining and global finetuning to enable fast preview and localized editing effects. The main hypothesis is that by using these techniques, they can achieve interactive pixel-level editing for NeRFs with instant preview speeds within 1 second, while previous methods are much slower or do not support this fine-grained editing control. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on various editing tasks compared to existing baselines.In summary, the core research focus is on achieving fast, flexible and interactive pixel-level editing for neural radiance fields through their proposed proxy function and two-stage training strategy. The key hypothesis is that this can enable real-time preview and localized editing that is not possible with prior NeRF editing techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes the first interactive pixel-level editing method and system for neural radiance fields (NeRF). It demonstrates various fine-grained editing tools including geometry (bounding box, brush, anchor) and color edits. 2. It introduces a proxy function to establish correspondence between explicit editing instructions and implicit NeRF network parameter updates. It also uses a teacher-student distillation strategy to update the parameters.3. It proposes a two-stage training strategy - fast local pretraining for instant preview, and global finetuning for high quality results. The pretraining stage updates only local embedding grids to enable local editing effects without contaminating the global scene.In summary, this paper presents a novel interactive editing framework for NeRFs that supports pixel-level free editing with instant preview capabilities. It addresses the challenges of establishing correspondence between edits and implicit representations, and enabling localized editing effects. The proposed method does not require any explicit proxy structure like meshes. A variety of editing tools and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other recent research on neural radiance field (NeRF) editing:- This paper proposes the first interactive pixel-level editing system for NeRFs, allowing for fine-grained edits like 3D painting and sculpting. Prior NeRF editing methods focus more on coarse object-level manipulation. - The system does not require any explicit geometry proxy like meshes, unlike recent methods such as NeRF-Editing and NeuMesh. This allows more flexible editing unconstrained by a proxy structure.- A key novelty is the instant preview capability, achieved via a two-stage training strategy. Local pretraining enables preview in seconds, while most existing methods require minutes to hours of optimization.- The editing guidance is generated by a proxy mapping function and teacher-student distillation, avoiding complex loss design or additional pipelines. This improves the flexibility and simplicity of the editing framework.- Various editing types (geometry and appearance) are supported through customizable proxy functions, including transformations, 3D brushing, anchoring, and color editing. Most prior works focus on only one specific edit type.- Experiments show the method generates high-quality view-consistent editing results on both synthetic and real captured scenes. Comparisons to baselines like NeuMesh demonstrate superior quality and speed.In summary, this work moves NeRF editing capability towards instant, interactive, pixel-level editing without proxies, advancing the state-of-the-art in terms of flexibility, quality and efficiency. The editing framework and strategies could inspire future research to build richer NeRF editing functionalities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions the authors suggest:- Exploring different backbone architectures for the student network beyond Instant-NGP. The authors note their editing framework can work with other NeRF architectures as long as they follow a similar volume rendering pipeline. Testing with other backbone options could improve edit quality or speed.- Supporting more complex lighting effects like specular reflections. The authors mention this is a limitation of their current method. Extending it to handle complex appearance effects would increase editing flexibility. - Handling reconstruction failures and artifacts in the original NeRF model. The authors note their method does not fix issues like floating artifacts from the initial NeRF. Developing techniques to address these problems would improve edit robustness.- Extending to video editing. The current method operates on static NeRF models. Adapting the approach to video NeRF could enable video editing applications.- Exploring intrinsic decomposition to enable illumination editing. The authors suggest using intrinsic image decomposition could allow edits like changing scene lighting.- Developing undo functions and history tracking. Adding undo capabilities would improve the interactive editing experience.- Testing on a wider range of scenes and editing types. Evaluating the approach on more diverse data could reveal opportunities and challenges for future improvement.- Improving training speed and edit preview latency further. The authors have optimized for interactivity but more gains in speed are possible.In summary, the main suggested directions are around expanding the flexibility, robustness and speed of the editing framework, as well as supporting more editing types and use cases. The interactive editing paradigm shows promise and there are many opportunities to build on this work.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new interactive editing method and system called Seal-3D for neural radiance fields (NeRF) models. The system allows users to edit NeRF models in a pixel-level, free manner with instant preview of the editing effects. To enable this, the authors propose a proxy function that maps user editing instructions to perturbations in the original NeRF model space, and use a teacher-student training strategy to update the model parameters accordingly.

The system supports editing tools like bounding boxes, brushes, anchors and color tools to edit geometry and appearance, and is demonstrated on synthetic and real captured scenes. The key contributions are the proxy function for establishing correspondence between edits and model updates, the two-stage training for interactivity, and a showcase of diverse pixel-level editing tools.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here are two paragraphs summarizing the key points of the paper:The paper proposes Seal-3D, a new interactive editing method and system for neural radiance fields (NeRF). The goal is to allow users to edit NeRF models in a pixel-level, free manner with instant preview of the editing effects. To achieve this, the authors address two main challenges of implicit neural scene representations like NeRF. First, they establish correspondence between explicit user editing instructions and implicit network parameter updates through a proxy mapping function and teacher-student distillation strategy. Second, they enable localized editing without contaminating the global scene by using a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, only local embedding grids are updated to provide a fast, coarse preview. In the second stage, the full network is finetuned for accurate and consistent results. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real datasets with four example tools: bounding box, brushing, anchor, and color tools. Results demonstrate interactive editing speeds of around 1 second as well as higher visual quality compared to recent baselines. The editing capabilities are also more extensive, with no restrictions on proxy structures. Limitations include a lack of support for complex lighting effects and an inability to handle reconstruction failures in the original NeRF model. Overall, this work represents an important step towards interactive pixel-level editing for implicit neural 3D representations. The NeRF-agnostic design and flexible tools showcase the potential for practical editing applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a new interactive editing method and system for neural radiance fields, called Seal-3D, which allows users to edit NeRF models in a pixel-level and free manner. The key idea is to use a teacher-student training strategy. First, a teacher NeRF model generates pseudo ground truth editing guidance from user inputs by warping the target editing space to the original scene space using a proxy mapping function. Then a student NeRF model is trained to match the teacher's output in a two-stage process - fast local pretraining to enable instant preview, followed by global finetuning for high quality results. This allows arbitrary pixel-level editing while maintaining interactivity. The editing tools demonstrated include bounding box, brushing, anchor points, and color tools.
