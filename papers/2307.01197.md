# [Segment Anything Meets Point Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01197)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes SAM-PT, a method for zero-shot video object segmentation that combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with point tracking. The main research question is:Can we effectively extend the zero-shot image segmentation capabilities of SAM to the video domain by utilizing sparse point propagation and prompting techniques?The key hypothesis is that by propagating sparse points that characterize the target object and using these points to prompt SAM, the model can segment anything in videos without requiring video segmentation data during training. This point-driven strategy can exploit rich local structure information to achieve strong generalization.In summary, the central research question is whether SAM's impressive zero-shot segmentation capability on images can be leveraged for video segmentation via point tracking and prompting. The core hypothesis is that sparse point propagation with SAM prompting is an effective approach for zero-shot video object segmentation.
