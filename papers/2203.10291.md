# [Exploring Motion Ambiguity and Alignment for High-Quality Video Frame   Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10291)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is:

How to improve video frame interpolation by handling motion ambiguity and better utilizing multi-scale information? 

Specifically, the key aspects investigated are:

1. Motion Ambiguity: The paper points out that existing video frame interpolation methods overly rely on predefined ground truth frames, ignoring the inherent ambiguity in motion when interpolating between two input frames. To address this, the paper proposes a novel texture consistency loss (TCL) that relaxes the requirement for strict matching to ground truth and allows more diversity in plausible interpolated results. 

2. Multi-Scale Alignment: The paper argues that prior methods do not make full use of multi-scale information when aligning frames/features for interpolation. It proposes a cross-scale pyramid alignment (CSPA) module to better exploit cross-scale correlations and perform more robust alignment in an efficient manner.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that allowing for motion ambiguity and better utilizing multi-scale information can improve the quality of video frame interpolation. The two main technical contributions are the proposed TCL loss and CSPA module that aim to achieve these goals. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, supporting the efficacy of the proposed techniques.
