# [Two-Channel Extended Kalman Filtering with Intermittent Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers the problem of state estimation for nonlinear systems with measurements received via two lossy communication channels. Specifically, it addresses two related problems:

1) Stochastic two-channel (2C) estimation: The two channels drop packets stochastically with different probabilities. The goal is to analyze the stability and boundedness properties of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) in this setting. 

2) 2C scheduling: The estimator can choose when to read each channel. The goal is to schedule channel readings to balance low channel usage with accurate state estimates.

Proposed Solutions:

1) For stochastic 2C EKF, the paper generalizes previous analysis for linear systems to derive conditions for boundedness of the error covariance matrix. These conditions depend on the dropout probabilities of the two channels. The paper also provides a method to compute an upper bound on these probabilities.

2) For 2C scheduling, the key idea is to solve an optimization problem to find a pair of channel readout periods that balances low channel usage with a low trace of the error covariance matrix. This trace serves as a proxy for estimation accuracy. The optimizer searches over feasible channel probabilities that ensure bounded estimation error per the analysis in 1). 

For linear systems, the existing analysis is leveraged directly. For nonlinear EKF, two solutions are proposed: a) Apply the new 2C EKF analysis to restrict the search space; b) Empirically relinearize the system and repeat the optimization when the dynamics change significantly.

Main Contributions:

- Analysis of stability for 2C EKF with stochastic packet drops 

- Method for 2C scheduling that balances channel utilization vs. estimation accuracy

- Validation in simulations (linear & nonlinear dynamics) and real robotic experiment (underwater vehicle localization)

- Two solutions for nonlinear 2C scheduling: using 2C EKF analysis, and empirical relinearization

The paper provides useful analysis and scheduling methods for state estimation over lossy, intermittently-available multi-channel sensor suite. The solutions are validated for a practical robotic application.
