# [A Preconditioned Interior Point Method for Support Vector Machines Using   an ANOVA-Decomposition and NFFT-Based Matrix-Vector Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00538)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes using an interior point method (IPM) to efficiently solve the optimization problem arising in training support vector machines (SVMs). To overcome the computational bottlenecks of operating with the large kernel matrix, the authors suggest approximating the matrix-vector products using an ANOVA decomposition of the kernel and leveraging fast NFFT approaches. Specifically, they break the high-dimensional kernel down into a sum of lower-dimensional kernels, each operating on at most 3 features. To further accelerate convergence of the iterative linear solvers within the IPM, they employ preconditioners based on low-rank kernel approximations such as pivoted Cholesky and Nystr√∂m methods. Numerical results on large benchmark datasets demonstrate that their proposed NFFTSVMipm approach can outperform state-of-the-art SVM solvers like LIBSVM in terms of computational complexity. The method is particularly advantageous for very large datasets with over 100,000 data points, where it requires less overall runtime while achieving competitive or even improved predictive accuracy compared to LIBSVM. Key innovations include the additive ANOVA kernel coupled with NFFT and tailored preconditioners to enable efficient embedding into the IPM optimization scheme.
