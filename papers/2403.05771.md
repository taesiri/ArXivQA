# [Providing Safety Assurances for Systems with Unknown Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05771)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autonomous systems are becoming more complex, requiring deep learning to model their dynamics. However, it is difficult to provide safety guarantees for such learned models due to uncertainty. 
- The goal is to provide safety assurances for systems with unknown, potentially complex dynamics that are difficult to model analytically.

Proposed Solution:
- Learn an ensemble of neural networks to model the system dynamics. Use the ensemble uncertainty as a measure of model uncertainty.  
- Formulate a robust optimal control problem to compute a maximal robust control invariant safe set that keeps the system safe under bounded model uncertainty.
- Solve a Hamilton-Jacobi reachability problem to obtain the safe set and safety controller that renders it control invariant.

Key Contributions:
- A general framework to provide safety guarantees for systems with unknown dynamics by incorporating state-dependent model uncertainty bounds.
- A concrete instantiation using neural network ensembles for dynamics modeling and model uncertainty quantification.
- Demonstrated the approach on an inverted pendulum simulation and TurtleBot robot experiment. Showed the benefits of modeling uncertainty for safety.

In summary, the key idea is to learn a dynamics model ensemble, quantify uncertainty for safety analysis, formulate a robust optimal control problem with uncertainty sets, and solve it using reachability analysis to provide robust safety assurances. The framework is general but demonstrated using neural network ensembles. Experiments highlight the importance of accounting for model uncertainty when providing safety guarantees.
