# [HOLMES: HOLonym-MEronym based Semantic inspection for Convolutional   Image Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the dominant models for computer vision, but their learning process and internal knowledge are non-transparent. This makes it challenging to understand and trust their decisions.
- Current explainability methods provide saliency maps indicating important regions for classification, but this is still very "shallow". Humans tend to understand images in terms of objects and their parts.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes HOLMES (HOLonym-MEronym based Semantic inspection) to generate part-based explanations for CNN image classifiers.
- Given an input image, HOLMES first extracts the parts (meronyms) of the predicted object class (holonym) using an ontology or knowledge base.
- Images of the parts are collected, either from annotated datasets or via web scraping. These are used to train CNN-based meronym detectors.
- By explaining the meronym models' decisions on the input image and masking different parts, HOLMES determines which ones most impact the holonym classifier and provides part-level heatmaps.

Main Contributions:
- A pipeline to automatically construct part-based explanations to complement existing saliency maps for CNN classifiers.
- Leveraging explicit part-of relationships and web data instead of dense pixel annotations to learn detectors for parts.  
- Evaluation demonstrating high correspondence between highlighted parts and ground truth. Comparable metrics to GradCAM saliency maps but with more intuitive, fine-grained explanations.
- Analysis relating detection of parts to impact on holonym classifier confidence, showing certain parts are consistently important across classes.

In summary, HOLMES moves beyond treating CNNs as black boxes, opening them up by connecting learned visual features to symbolic knowledge about objects and explaining decisions based on parts rather than opaque model internals. This facilitates better understanding and trust in model predictions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes HOLMES, a novel explainable AI technique for image classifiers that automatically breaks down image labels into constituent parts, trains detectors for those parts, and generates part-level heatmaps to explain which components are most relevant to the classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new explainable AI (XAI) technique called HOLMES (HOLonym-MEronym based Semantic inspection) that provides part-based explanations for image classification models. Specifically:

1) HOLMES decomposes the predicted image label (holonym) into a set of related parts (meronyms) using knowledge bases and ontologies. 

2) It collects or scrapes images of the parts and trains meronym classifiers using transfer learning from the holonym model. 

3) It then produces heatmaps and importance scores highlighting the identified parts and quantifying their contribution to the holonym model's classification. 

4) Compared to existing saliency methods like Grad-CAM that provide label-level heatmaps, HOLMES generates fine-grained part-based explanations (e.g. this is classified as a cat because of the ears and tail) without needing dense pixel-level part annotations.

5) Extensive experiments on PASCAL-Part and ImageNet datasets demonstrate HOLMES can recognize parts, attribute classification scores to parts, and generate high-quality explanations comparable to Grad-CAM but with more interpretable part-based information.

In summary, the key novelty is providing richer and more human-interpretable explanations by connecting the holonym-meronym hierarchical relationship with deep neural network representations and transferring learnt feature knowledge to recognize constituent parts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Holonym-meronym relationship - The whole-part relationship between an object (holonym) and its constituent parts (meronyms). This is a key concept that the HOLMES method is built upon.

- Part-based explanations - Instead of providing label-level explanations like most saliency methods, HOLMES generates fine-grained, part-based explanations to justify image classifications.

- Knowledge bases/ontologies - External knowledge bases containing part-of relationships are used to extract meronyms for holonyms. This allows generating explanations without dense pixel-level annotations.

- Web scraping - As an alternative to structured knowledge bases, web scraping is used to build meronym training sets by querying search engines. Images are downloaded, deduplicated and filtered.

- Transfer learning - The holonym model's feature extractor is reused when training the meronym models. This allows the meronym models to leverage the hierarchical features already learned by the holonym model.

- Meronym localization - Evaluating how precisely the meronym heatmaps localize constituent object parts compared to the holonym heatmap.

- Score drop - Ablating meronyms from the image and measuring the drop in the holonym model's confidence provides a score to quantify the part's importance.

- Insertion/deletion/preservation curves - Standard causal evaluation metrics used to quantitatively assess the quality of the produced explanations versus random and GradCAM baselines.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does HOLMES leverage ontologies and web scraping to construct meronym-based detectors without relying on densely annotated datasets? What are the tradeoffs with using web scraping versus annotated datasets?

2. What image preprocessing steps does HOLMES take after scraping images from the web? Why are these steps important? 

3. How does HOLMES transfer knowledge from the holonym classifier to train the meronym classifiers? Why is transfer learning an appropriate technique here?

4. What metrics does HOLMES use to evaluate the quality of the trained meronym classifiers? Why are calibrated per-part F1 scores better than raw F1 scores? 

5. How does HOLMES generate saliency maps and attribution scores for each detected meronym? Walk through the steps to combine per-meronym explanations into a global explanation.

6. What are the key differences in experimental setup between using the PASCAL-Part dataset versus scraping from ImageNet labels and WordNet? How do the quantitative results compare?

7. What factors influence the variation in performance between different holonym classes? How could the scraping process be improved to achieve more consistent meronym detection?

8. How do the insertion/deletion/preservation metrics demonstrate the faithfulness of HOLMES explanations? How do they compare to baseline methods?  

9. What are some of the limitations of relying on holonym-meronym relationships and web scraping? How could the approach be extended to other types of semantic relationships?

10. How does HOLMES compare to other CNN interpretation techniques like network dissection? What unique advantages does it offer for understanding learned representations?
