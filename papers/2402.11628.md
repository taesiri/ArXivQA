# [Discrete Neural Algorithmic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11628)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to capture computations with neural networks by imitating the execution of classical algorithms. However, current neural reasoners struggle to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. 
- In contrast, classical algorithms are not affected by distribution shifts as they transition between predefined discrete states. 

Proposed Solution:
- Force neural reasoners to maintain the execution trajectory as a combination of finite predefined states. 
- Discretize hidden representations into a fixed set of node and edge states that align with the states of the original algorithm.
- Use an attention-based module to select messages between states based on both discrete state priorities and continuous scalar edge weights.
- Learn state transitions supervised with algorithm execution hints.

Contributions:
- Propose fully discrete and interpretable neural reasoners that perfectly capture algorithm dynamics on the training distribution.
- Achieve 100% test accuracy on all tasks of the SALSA-CLRS benchmark, with guarantees of correctness for any test data.  
- Demonstrate that discretization is crucial for robust algorithmic reasoning and overcoming distribution shifts.
- Show state-based supervision enables step-wise learning and model verification through exhaustive state transition testing.
- Discuss learning without hints as an open problem, relating model complexity to generalization.

In summary, the paper introduces a method to learn highly generalizable and interpretable neural models that provably emulate algorithm execution, through architectural constraints that align learned states with formal computation traces.
