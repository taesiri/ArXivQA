# [Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13682)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Threats, Attacks, and Defenses in Machine Unlearning: A Survey":

Problem: 
Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a crucial technique for removing the influence of specific data from trained machine learning models. This enables addressing issues like data privacy, quality, sensitivity, and compliance with regulations like the right to be forgotten (RTBF). However, MU systems face significant threats and vulnerabilities that can lead to attacks, resulting in information leakage, performance degradation, or manipulation. Defending against such attacks is challenging. 

Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of threats, attacks and defenses in MU:

Threats and Attacks:
- Information Leakage: Attackers exploit discrepancies between trained and unlearned models or dependencies to extract private information about unlearned data via inference or reconstruction attacks.  
- Malicious Unlearning: By crafting malicious unlearning requests, attackers cause untargeted performance decline or insert targeted backdoors. This can be done directly or in a preconditioned manner by manipulating training data.
- Other Vulnerabilities: Poisoning attacks can slow down MU. Over-forgetting in MU algorithms also causes performance decline.

Defenses: 
- Limit information leakage by techniques like differential privacy. Detect malicious requests through membership checks or monitoring.  
- Unlearning itself acts as a defense by removing backdoors or aligning models to values.
- Attacks can evaluate MU by auditing privacy leakage, assessing model robustness or providing proof of unlearning.

Main Contributions:
1) A unified MU workflow and novel taxonomy of threats, attacks and defenses.
2) In-depth analysis of current threats, attacks, defenses and their complex interrelationships. 
3) Identification of challenges and promising directions like defenses against malicious unlearning requests, federated unlearning, privacy preservation and unlearning over large models.

In summary, this paper provides a holistic examination of the intricate connections between threats, attacks and defenses in MU systems, offering valuable insights to guide future research towards safer and more reliable MU techniques.
