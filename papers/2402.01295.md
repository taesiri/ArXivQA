# [ExtremeCast: Boosting Extreme Value Prediction for Global Weather   Forecast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most machine learning models for weather forecasting struggle to accurately predict extreme weather events like heatwaves and typhoons. This is because commonly used loss functions like mean squared error (MSE) underestimate extreme values in the data. Through mathematical analysis using extreme value theory, the authors prove that MSE loss provides biased estimates and inevitably leads to underestimation of extremes.

Proposed Solution: 
To address this issue, the paper proposes:

1) A new asymmetric loss function called Exloss that eliminates the inherent bias of MSE. By scaling the loss asymmetrically, Exloss imposes higher penalties when the model underestimates extremes, thus providing accurate extreme value estimates. 

2) A training-free module called ExEnsemble that further improves the prediction of extremes at the pixel-level through ideas from ensemble forecasting and rank histogram methods. ExEnsemble expands the variance of predictions without altering the overall distribution.

3) The overall model ExtremeCast combines an advanced weather forecasting model with the above two components. It is first pretrained with MSE loss, then finetuned using Exloss loss. The diffusion model is also trained with Exloss to retain extreme details. Finally, during inference, the ExEnsemble module is added to boost extremes in the predictions.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a new explanation from extreme value theory on why MSE-based models struggle with predicting weather extremes
- Proposes novel asymmetric loss function Exloss to eliminate inherent underestimation bias
- Introduces training-free ExEnsemble method to further improve robustness of extreme weather predictions  
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on predicting extreme weather events like heatwaves and typhoons, while maintaining competitive overall accuracy


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel loss function (Exloss) and a training-free module (ExEnsemble) to boost extreme weather forecasting accuracy in data-driven global weather prediction models, while maintaining overall performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to improving extreme weather forecasting:

1. It provides a new theoretical explanation from extreme value theory for why MSE-based models tend to underestimate extreme values. It mathematically proves that MSE loss results in a bias towards underestimating extremes.

2. It proposes a novel asymmetric loss function called Exloss that eliminates the underestimation bias by scaling the loss asymmetrically to highlight extreme values. 

3. It introduces a training-free module called ExEnsemble that enhances extreme weather prediction at the pixel level by expanding the variance of predictions without compromising overall accuracy. 

4. Experiments on global weather forecasting demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on predicting various extreme weather events like heatwaves and typhoons, while maintaining competitive overall accuracy compared to top existing models.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive solution consisting of the Exloss function and ExEnsemble module to significantly boost the accuracy of predicting extreme weather based on an advanced baseline model. Both theory and experiments support the capability of this method.
