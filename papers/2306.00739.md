# [SQL-PaLM: Improved Large Language Model Adaptation for Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00739)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper proposes SQL-PaLM, an LLM-based Text-to-SQL model adapted from PaLM-2. The key research questions/goals appear to be:1) Can LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on Text-to-SQL task with simple prompting approaches (SQL-PaLM-icl)? The paper shows SQL-PaLM-icl outperforms prior SOTA with fine-tuning and recent SOTA with composite prompting.2) How does further fine-tuning of LLMs on Text-to-SQL data compare with prompting approaches (SQL-PaLM-ft)? The paper shows SQL-PaLM-ft outperforms SQL-PaLM-icl.3) How robust are LLM-based Text-to-SQL models on challenging variants of existing benchmarks? The paper analyzes performance on Spider-SYN, Spider-Realistic and Spider-DK.4) What are the capabilities and limitations of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models through qualitative analysis? The paper provides case studies and discusses success factors as well as sources of errors.In summary, the central goals are to propose SQL-PaLM models based on LLMs, establish new SOTA results, and provide insights into capabilities and limitations through quantitative benchmarking and qualitative analysis. The key hypothesis appears to be that LLMs can achieve strong Text-to-SQL performance with simple prompting and fine-tuning approaches.
