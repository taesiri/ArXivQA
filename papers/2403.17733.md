# [Continual Few-shot Event Detection via Hierarchical Augmentation   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the task of continual few-shot event detection (CFED). Traditional event detection methods rely on abundant labeled data for training, which is impractical to obtain in real applications where new event types continually emerge with only a few labeled examples (few-shot). Existing continual learning methods also assume sufficient training data. CFED introduces a more realistic yet challenging scenario that requires models to detect and classify events on continually emerging new types while only having access to a few (e.g. 5 or 10) labeled examples per new event type. This is difficult due to the need to memorize previous event types despite limited memory capacity and learn new types from few examples without overfitting.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a memory-based approach called Hierarchical Augmentation Networks (HANet) to address CFED. It has two key components:

1) Prototypical Augmentation: To memorize previous types with limited exemplars in memory, it augments the prototypical feature space of exemplars by modeling them as Gaussian distributions and sampling synthetic features. This expands the limited memory to better represent previous types. 

2) Contrastive Augmentation: To mitigate overfitting when learning new types from few examples, it creates augmented views of the limited samples and maximizes agreement between differently augmented views of the same example via a contrastive loss. This allows better generalization.

Together, the hierarchical augmentation approach allows effectively retaining past knowledge and generalizing to new types. HANet also uses an event detector and knowledge distillation.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes the new task of continual few-shot event detection (CFED) and creates benchmarks for it.

2) Develops a novel memory-based approach with hierarchical augmentation techniques to address key challenges in CFED.

3) Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on CFED benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods and even an LLM baseline of ChatGPT.

The paper makes CFED more realistic and advances continual few-shot learning for event detection. HANet's augmentation techniques effectively alleviate forgetting and overfitting issues for this challenging problem.
