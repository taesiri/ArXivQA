# [Adversarial Camera Patch: An Effective and Robust Physical-World Attack   on Object Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06163)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Adversarial Camera Patch (ADCP), a novel black-box physical attack method against object detectors. ADCP uses a single translucent patch attached to the camera lens to generate adversarial perturbations. The physical parameters (position, color, width, transparency) of the patch are optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization to craft highly effective adversarial examples while preserving stealthiness. Experiments demonstrate ADCP's superior attack performance (96.31% attack success rate indoors; 88.31% outdoors) and robustness across varying conditions compared to prior camera-based attacks. ADCP requires only basic, inexpensive equipment (~$7), enhancing real-world feasibility. By avoiding target object modifications and using just one patch, ADCP provides operational simplicity while ensuring inconspicuousness of the perturbation. The authors advocate for prompt attention to ADCP due to its combination of strong adversarial impact, easy deployability, stealthiness and transferability posing a realistic threat to object detectors operating in the physical world.
