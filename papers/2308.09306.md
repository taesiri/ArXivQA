# [DiffDis: Empowering Generative Diffusion Model with Cross-Modal   Discrimination Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09306)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper addresses is: Can we unify the training of generative and discriminative tasks under the diffusion process to improve both image generation and image-text discrimination capabilities in a single model?The key hypothesis is that by reformulating the image-text discriminative problem as a generative diffusion process conditioned on images, and proposing a dual-stream network architecture and unified training paradigm, it is possible to achieve superior performance on both text-guided image generation and zero-shot classification/retrieval compared to single-task models.In essence, the paper explores jointly training a generative diffusion model and a cross-modal discrimination model in an end-to-end fashion under the diffusion framework. The goal is to impart the discriminative capabilities of vision-language models like CLIP to generative diffusion models, while retaining strong generative performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing DiffDis, a unified vision-language diffusion model for both multi-modality generation and discrimination tasks under the diffusion paradigm. 2. Reformulating the image-text discriminative problem as a generative diffusion process of text embeddings conditioned on input images.3. Designing a dual-stream network architecture and proposing a diffusion-based unified training paradigm to jointly train the generative and discriminative tasks.4. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that DiffDis outperforms single-task models, with improvements on average zero-shot classification accuracy and text-guided image generation quality. DiffDis also outperforms CLIP on zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval.In summary, the key contribution is the proposed DiffDis framework that unifies generative and discriminative learning within a single diffusion model, leading to improved performance on both generative and discriminative tasks compared to single-task models. The reformulation of the discriminative problem as a conditioned diffusion process and the dual-stream architecture are notable innovations enabling this unified training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes DiffDis, a novel unified vision-language diffusion model for both image generation and discrimination tasks, which achieves superior performance over single-task baselines on text-to-image generation and zero-shot classification through a dual-stream architecture and diffusion-based training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:- This paper proposes DiffDis, a novel framework to unify generative and discriminative tasks under the diffusion process. Other methods like HybViT and Pix2Seq have tried combining these tasks, but using different approaches like adding classification heads or reformulating as sequence prediction. DiffDis is the first to explore unifying them under diffusion.- For generative modeling, DiffDis builds on top of recent large-scale diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 2. It adapts these models to also handle discriminative tasks within the diffusion framework. Other generative models like GANs or autoregressive models have not shown the same image synthesis quality.- For discriminative modeling, DiffDis follows a similar motivation as vision-language pretraining models like CLIP, Align, and FILIP. But instead of contrastive learning, it uses diffusion probabilistic models and formulations to align image and text.- Experiments show DiffDis outperforms single-task baselines in both generative and discriminative metrics. It also outperforms CLIP in discriminative tasks, showing the benefit of incorporating generative modeling.In summary, DiffDis proposes a novel way of combining generative and discriminative tasks under diffusion, achieving strong performance in both areas. It builds on recent advances in diffusion models and vision-language pretraining, while proposing new model architectures and training formulations tailored for this joint setting. The results demonstrate the promise of this unified approach compared to prior single-task or non-diffusion models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Expanding the training data: The authors note that since DiffDis was trained on CC3M, which contains mostly general scene images, the image generation quality is lower on some specific domains like humans and animals. They suggest that adding more training data from these specific domains could improve the generation quality.- Improving the autoencoder model: The authors note that the reconstructed images from the autoencoder may lose some details from the original images, which can hurt generation quality. They suggest exploring better autoencoder models that can help preserve more details.- Filtering the training data: The authors find that some images in CC3M contain watermarks, which then show up in the generated images. They suggest exploring techniques to filter the training data to remove watermarked images.- Accelerating inference speed: The authors note that DiffDis requires a large number of sampling steps for inference on discriminative tasks, which slows down inference. They suggest exploring advanced sampling techniques that could accelerate inference without sacrificing performance.- Exploring other unified frameworks: The authors position their work as an early exploration of unifying generative and discriminative diffusion models. They suggest that future work could build on their approach to develop new unified frameworks for multi-task, multi-modal training.In summary, the main directions are improving the training data, model architectures, and inference efficiency, as well as further exploring how to effectively unify generative and discriminative modeling within diffusion-based frameworks. The authors view their work as an initial step toward these goals.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes DiffDis, a unified vision-language diffusion model for both multi-modality generation and discrimination tasks. DiffDis reformulates the image-text discriminative problem as a generative diffusion process of text embeddings conditioned on input images, allowing image generation and text discrimination to share the same image-branch network. A dual-stream network architecture is proposed to fuse knowledge from latent images into the text query for alignment learning. A unified training paradigm allows alternating between generative and discriminative tasks. Experiments demonstrate DiffDis outperforms single-task models, improving average zero-shot classification accuracy across 12 datasets by 1.65\% and FID of text-guided image generation by 2.42. DiffDis also outperforms CLIP models, improving average zero-shot classification accuracy by 4.7\% and average R@1 of retrieval on COCO/Flickr30k by 14.5\%. This work is the first to unify generative and discriminative training under diffusion, serving as an early exploration for future multi-task multi-modal models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents DiffDis, a unified vision-language diffusion model for both image generation and image-text discrimination tasks. DiffDis first formulates the image-text discriminative problem as a generative diffusion process of text embeddings conditioned on input images. This allows the generative and discriminative tasks to share the same image-branch network structure. For discriminative learning, DiffDis proposes a dual-stream network architecture to fuse knowledge about the latent image into the text query at different scales. It also introduces a unified training paradigm to feed required inputs and conditions for each task. Extensive experiments demonstrate DiffDis's effectiveness, achieving improved performance on both generative and discriminative tasks compared to single-task models. For example, DiffDis obtains a 1.65% higher average zero-shot classification accuracy across 12 datasets and a 2.42 better FID score for text-guided image synthesis over the single-task baseline. Compared to CLIP, DiffDis achieves 4.7% higher average zero-shot classification accuracy and 14.5% better average R@1 on image-text retrieval.In summary, this work makes three main contributions: (1) proposing DiffDis as a unified diffusion model for generation and discrimination tasks, (2) reformulating the discriminative problem as a conditioned diffusion process and designing a dual-stream architecture for alignment learning, and (3) introducing a unified training paradigm and demonstrating improved performance over single-task models on both generative and discriminative tasks. This exploration helps advance multi-task multi-modal models under the diffusion framework.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a unified vision-language diffusion model called DiffDis for both image generation and image-text discrimination tasks. The key ideas are:1) Formulating the image-text discrimination task as a conditional diffusion process of text embeddings based on input images. This allows sharing the image encoder between the generative and discriminative tasks. 2) A dual-stream network architecture that fuses knowledge from latent images into the text query at different scales for better image-text alignment. This includes a novel attention block design.3) A unified training paradigm that alternates between masking text and image inputs/conditions to train the generative and discriminative tasks jointly.Overall, DiffDis unifies generative and discriminative diffusion models into one framework and achieves improved performance on both zero-shot classification and text-to-image generation compared to single-task baselines. The dual-stream architecture and training paradigm are key contributions for enabling this joint modeling.
