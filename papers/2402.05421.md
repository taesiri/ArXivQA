# [DiffTOP: Differentiable Trajectory Optimization for Deep Reinforcement   and Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05421)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Choosing a good policy representation is important for reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) to achieve good performance. Prior works have explored using feedforward neural networks, energy-based models, or diffusion models as the policy representation.

- In model-based RL, there is an "objective mismatch" issue - models trained to minimize prediction error are not necessarily good for control. Models need to be trained to directly optimize task performance. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DiffTOP, which uses differentiable trajectory optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for RL and IL. 

- Trajectory optimization is widely used in control, defined by a cost function and dynamics function. It can be viewed as a policy where the parameters define the cost and dynamics.

- By using recent advances in differentiable trajectory optimization, DiffTOP can compute gradients of the loss w.r.t. the trajectory optimization parameters. This enables end-to-end learning of the cost and dynamics functions.

Key Contributions:

- Apply differentiable trajectory optimization to model-based RL. Addresses "objective mismatch" by computing policy gradient loss on optimized actions and backpropagating through trajectory optimization. Directly optimizes dynamics model for task performance.

- Benchmark DiffTOP on IL with image and point cloud inputs. Training procedure using trajectory optimization is more stable than prior energy-based model approaches. Outperforms feedforward policies by optimizing learned cost function at test time.

- Conduct experiments on 15 model-based RL tasks and 13 IL tasks. DiffTOP outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both domains. Provides insights into performance gains via analysis and ablations.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage differentiable trajectory optimization to enable end-to-end learning of the parameters of the optimization process itself for RL and IL. This provides performance benefits over prior policy representation approaches.
