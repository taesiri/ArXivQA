# [Dream2Real: Zero-Shot 3D Object Rearrangement with Vision-Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04533)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Dream2Real, a novel framework for enabling robots to perform language-conditioned object rearrangement in complex 3D scenes. The key idea is to construct a separate 3D neural representation for each object using NeRF, which can be virtually rearranged and rendered from new viewpoints. These rendered images of imaginary scene configurations are then evaluated by a visual-language model like CLIP to determine how well they satisfy the user's instruction. This approach operates zero-shot, without requiring training on rearrangement demonstrations. Experiments demonstrate that Dream2Real succeeds on everyday tabletop rearrangement tasks, understands complex spatial relationships between multiple objects, and enables 6-degree-of-freedom manipulation for cluttered and occluded environments. Comparisons show it outperforms a state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline on some tasks. Overall, this work enables bringing the powerful reasoning abilities of vision-language models like CLIP, typically applied to images, to complex 3D robotic manipulation problems with promising results.
