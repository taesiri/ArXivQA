# [Three Sentences Are All You Need: Local Path Enhanced Document Relation   Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: Given an entity pair in a document, how many sentences are sufficient to identify the relationship between them?The key findings and contributions of the paper are:- Through analysis on 3 document-level RE datasets (DocRED, CDR, GDA), the authors find that most entity relation instances (95%+) can be identified using no more than 3 sentences as evidence. This suggests reading the full document may not be necessary for relation extraction.- The authors propose 3 heuristic rules to extract "paths" between entities that serve as good proxies for the annotated supporting evidence. Up to 87.5% of supporting evidence can be covered by the extracted paths.  - By feeding just the extracted paths (instead of full documents) to a BiLSTM model, the authors achieve strong performance on DocRED, even outperforming more complex graph-based models. This shows the sufficiency of their path extraction heuristics.- The key contributions are: (1) Empirical analysis showing relations can be identified from just a few sentences, motivating focused modeling; (2) Simple but effective path extraction heuristics to approximate supporting evidence; (3) Demonstrating strong performance can be achieved using just extracted paths, without full documents.In summary, the paper shows that for document-level RE, modeling just a few key sentences connecting entities is sufficient, instead of using full documents. The proposed path extraction heuristics are an effective way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. An analysis on 3 document-level relation extraction datasets showing that most relation instances can be identified using just 1-3 sentences, instead of the full document context. 2. Proposing heuristic rules to extract "paths" connecting entity pairs as a simple but effective way to select the most relevant evidence sentences. The paths include consecutive sentences, multi-hop connections via bridge entities, and default sentence pairs.  3. Demonstrating that feeding just the extracted paths to a simple BiLSTM model achieves strong performance on the DocRED benchmark, even outperforming more complex graph neural network models.4. Providing explanations for the observation that few sentences suffice for relation extraction from linguistic and cognitive science perspectives.In summary, the key ideas are:- Relation instances typically require only 1-3 sentences as evidence, not full documents.- Heuristic path extraction can effectively filter documents to relevant evidence. - Simple models over extracted paths can achieve very strong results.- The sufficiency of few sentences may be explained by linguistic patterns and cognitive factors.The overall contribution is showing that simple path extraction and modeling over a few sentences is a surprisingly effective approach for document-level relation extraction.
