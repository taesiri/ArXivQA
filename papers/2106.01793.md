# [Three Sentences Are All You Need: Local Path Enhanced Document Relation   Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: Given an entity pair in a document, how many sentences are sufficient to identify the relationship between them?

The key findings and contributions of the paper are:

- Through analysis on 3 document-level RE datasets (DocRED, CDR, GDA), the authors find that most entity relation instances (95%+) can be identified using no more than 3 sentences as evidence. This suggests reading the full document may not be necessary for relation extraction.

- The authors propose 3 heuristic rules to extract "paths" between entities that serve as good proxies for the annotated supporting evidence. Up to 87.5% of supporting evidence can be covered by the extracted paths.  

- By feeding just the extracted paths (instead of full documents) to a BiLSTM model, the authors achieve strong performance on DocRED, even outperforming more complex graph-based models. This shows the sufficiency of their path extraction heuristics.

- The key contributions are: (1) Empirical analysis showing relations can be identified from just a few sentences, motivating focused modeling; (2) Simple but effective path extraction heuristics to approximate supporting evidence; (3) Demonstrating strong performance can be achieved using just extracted paths, without full documents.

In summary, the paper shows that for document-level RE, modeling just a few key sentences connecting entities is sufficient, instead of using full documents. The proposed path extraction heuristics are an effective way to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. An analysis on 3 document-level relation extraction datasets showing that most relation instances can be identified using just 1-3 sentences, instead of the full document context. 

2. Proposing heuristic rules to extract "paths" connecting entity pairs as a simple but effective way to select the most relevant evidence sentences. The paths include consecutive sentences, multi-hop connections via bridge entities, and default sentence pairs.  

3. Demonstrating that feeding just the extracted paths to a simple BiLSTM model achieves strong performance on the DocRED benchmark, even outperforming more complex graph neural network models.

4. Providing explanations for the observation that few sentences suffice for relation extraction from linguistic and cognitive science perspectives.

In summary, the key ideas are:

- Relation instances typically require only 1-3 sentences as evidence, not full documents.
- Heuristic path extraction can effectively filter documents to relevant evidence. 
- Simple models over extracted paths can achieve very strong results.
- The sufficiency of few sentences may be explained by linguistic patterns and cognitive factors.

The overall contribution is showing that simple path extraction and modeling over a few sentences is a surprisingly effective approach for document-level relation extraction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper shows that for document-level relation extraction, most relation instances can be identified using only 1-3 sentences as evidence, and proposes a simple but effective method to heuristically select these key evidence sentences for each entity pair which improves performance when combined with a BiLSTM model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in document-level relation extraction:

- The core finding that most relation instances can be identified with just 1-3 sentences is novel. Prior work largely assumed reasoning over full documents was needed. This paper empirically analyzes real datasets to show relations are more locally identifiable.

- The proposed path extraction method is simple and interpretable compared to prior graph neural network based approaches. By explicitly extracting paths connecting entities, the method provides intuitive selected evidence.

- The performance of the path extraction + BiLSTM model is very competitive. It outperforms prior sequence models and even some graph models on the DocRED benchmark. This shows the effectiveness of focused sentence selection.

- The interdisciplinary discussion bringing in linguistics and cognitive science provides helpful context for the findings. Connecting the observed localization of relations to co-reference and working memory limitations gives plausible explanations.

- Overall, the paper makes a compelling argument that full document reasoning may be unnecessary, and that better performance can be achieved by careful sentence filtering. The simple proposed method matches or exceeds more complex models. The empirical analysis and findings appear novel and impactful.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the analysis and discussion in the paper, the authors suggest several future research directions:

- Further investigate the linguistic and cognitive explanations for the "three sentences are sufficient" phenomenon in document-level relation extraction. The authors provide some initial hypotheses from linguistic and cognitive perspectives, but more in-depth analysis is needed. 

- Explore different ways to select the most informative sentences/paths from documents for relation extraction. The heuristic rules proposed in this work serve as a strong baseline, but there may be better or more principled ways to identify key evidence sentences. 

- Study if the "three sentences" finding generalizes to other long context NLP tasks besides relation extraction, such as event extraction, coreference resolution, etc. 

- Develop models that can take advantage of the focused evidence sentences rather than modeling the full document. The authors show this is beneficial for a BiLSTM model, but more sophisticated models can be explored.

- Evaluate the real-world applicability of focused evidence selection, and whether it leads to efficiency gains for human annotation or deployment.

- Extend the analysis to other document-level NLP tasks like machine reading comprehension, summarization, etc. to see if similar evidence filtering is helpful.

In summary, the key future directions are: 1) further investigate the linguistic and cognitive hypotheses, 2) explore better evidence selection techniques, 3) study wider applicability to other tasks, 4) develop models leveraging selected evidence, and 5) validate real-world utility.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes three document-level relation extraction datasets and finds that humans can identify most relation instances using just 1-3 sentences as evidence. Motivated by this, the authors propose a simple but effective method to select the most relevant sentences between an entity pair as "paths" that connect the two entities. The paths are extracted using three heuristic rules: consecutive paths between entities in nearby sentences, multi-hop paths bridging distant entities via shared entities, and default paths between any sentences containing the entities. Experiments show these paths cover over 87% of human annotated evidence sentences and achieve strong relation extraction performance when fed to a BiLSTM model, outperforming even graph neural network models that use the full document context. The work provides an interesting perspective that extracting relations may only require a small part of a document, contrary to the common practice of using the full document context.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper analyzes three document-level relation extraction datasets - DocRED, CDR, and GDA - and finds that the majority of relation instances (87-95%) can be identified using just 1-3 sentences of context. Motivated by this observation, the authors propose a simple but effective method to select evidence sentences likely to contain crucial information for identifying relations between entity pairs. They identify three types of paths linking entities: consecutive paths between entities in nearby sentences, multi-hop paths bridging distant entities via intermediate entities, and default paths between any sentences containing the two entities. These paths cover 87.5% of human-annotated supporting evidence in DocRED, using only 2-3 sentences on average. Finally, a BiLSTM model using just the selected path sentences achieves 56.23 F1 on DocRED, outperforming more complex graph neural network models using full documents.  

In summary, this paper shows that most document-level relations can be identified using very limited context, and proposes an interpretable method to select likely evidence sentences. The selected sentences retain sufficient information for relation extraction, enabling a simple BiLSTM model to outperform state-of-the-art graph models using full documents. The results suggest that explicitly selecting evidence sentences can better focus neural models compared to relying on implicit graph-based filtering. The paper provides helpful insights into the contexts required for document-level relation extraction.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet effective method to select key evidence sentences for document-level relation extraction (RE). Through analysis of human annotations, the authors find that most relation instances can be identified using just 1-3 sentences. Based on this observation, they design heuristic rules to extract three types of "paths" connecting entity mentions: consecutive paths between entities in nearby sentences, multi-hop paths bridged via other entities, and default paths between any sentences containing the entities. These paths serve as a proxy for human-annotated evidence sentences. By feeding just the extracted paths instead of full documents to a BiLSTM model, the authors achieve strong performance on the DocRED benchmark, outperforming even fancy graph neural network models. Their interpretable path extraction method provides a way to focus neural models on crucial evidence sentences rather than full documents for document-level RE.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of identifying the minimal set of sentences needed to extract entity relations from documents for document-level relation extraction. The key questions it investigates are:

- How many sentences from a document are actually needed to identify a relationship between an entity pair? 

- Which sentences are the most crucial or decisive for identifying entity relations in a document?

The authors perform analysis on several relation extraction datasets and find that most entity relation instances can be identified using just 1-3 sentences, rather than needing the full document context. Based on this finding, they propose heuristic rules to extract "paths" between entities that approximate the minimal evidence sentences. They show these paths can cover the majority of annotated evidence sentences and achieve strong performance when used with a simple BiLSTM model, comparable to more complex graph-based models.

In summary, the key focus is on identifying and selecting only the minimal set of crucial sentences needed for document-level relation extraction, rather than relying on full documents which contain extraneous information. The analysis and path extraction methods aim to determine and leverage these minimal evidence sentences.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords are:

- Document-level relation extraction - The paper focuses on extracting relations between entities at the document level, rather than just within a sentence. This is more challenging as it requires reasoning across sentences.

- Supporting evidence - The annotated sentences in the datasets that provide evidence for deciding on a relation between two entities. The paper analyzes the size of supporting evidence needed.

- Paths - The paper proposes extracting paths between entities as a proxy for supporting evidence. Three types of paths are defined: consecutive paths, multi-hop paths, and default paths. 

- Heuristic rules - Simple but effective rules for extracting paths between entities based on their positions in the document. The paths act as important evidence sentences.

- BiLSTM - A bidirectional LSTM is used as the model architecture for relation extraction, taking the extracted paths as input instead of the full document.

- Performance - The paths + BiLSTM method achieves strong performance on the DocRED benchmark, outperforming more complex graph-based models.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a simple yet effective method for document-level relation extraction (RE) that selects a few key "path" sentences connecting entities, instead of using the full document context. Through analysis of three benchmark datasets, the authors find that human annotators generally only need 1-3 sentences to identify relations between entities. Thus, they design heuristic rules to extract "paths" between entities, including consecutive sentences containing both entities, "multi-hop" paths bridged through other entities, and default paths with one entity per sentence. Experiments show their path selection covers over 87% of gold annotated evidence sentences on average, using just 2-3 sentences. A BiLSTM model over just the selected paths surprisingly outperforms more complex graph neural networks using the full document on DocRED benchmark, achieving 56.23% F1. The linguistics and cognitive perspectives discussed provide explanations for why local paths may sufficiently encode relations. Overall, this work demonstrates an embarrassingly simple but highly effective method of selecting crucial local context for document-level RE.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates how many sentences are needed to identify relations between entity pairs in document-level relation extraction. Through analysis of three benchmark datasets, the authors find that most relations can be identified with just 1-3 sentences of supporting evidence. Based on this observation, the authors propose heuristic rules to extract "paths" connecting entity mentions, including consecutive sentences containing both entities, sentences linked via bridge entities, and default sentence pairs containing one entity each. These paths cover over 80% of annotated evidence sentences while drastically reducing irrelevant information. A simple BiLSTM model using just the extracted paths achieves strong performance on DocRED, outperforming even graph neural networks using the full document context. The authors posit linguistic and cognitive explanations for the sufficiency of 1-3 sentences, relating to coreference and limited working memory capacity. Overall, this work demonstrates that a small number of key sentences can retain the essential contextual information for document-level relation extraction.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:
