# [Three Sentences Are All You Need: Local Path Enhanced Document Relation   Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01793)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: Given an entity pair in a document, how many sentences are sufficient to identify the relationship between them?The key findings and contributions of the paper are:- Through analysis on 3 document-level RE datasets (DocRED, CDR, GDA), the authors find that most entity relation instances (95%+) can be identified using no more than 3 sentences as evidence. This suggests reading the full document may not be necessary for relation extraction.- The authors propose 3 heuristic rules to extract "paths" between entities that serve as good proxies for the annotated supporting evidence. Up to 87.5% of supporting evidence can be covered by the extracted paths.  - By feeding just the extracted paths (instead of full documents) to a BiLSTM model, the authors achieve strong performance on DocRED, even outperforming more complex graph-based models. This shows the sufficiency of their path extraction heuristics.- The key contributions are: (1) Empirical analysis showing relations can be identified from just a few sentences, motivating focused modeling; (2) Simple but effective path extraction heuristics to approximate supporting evidence; (3) Demonstrating strong performance can be achieved using just extracted paths, without full documents.In summary, the paper shows that for document-level RE, modeling just a few key sentences connecting entities is sufficient, instead of using full documents. The proposed path extraction heuristics are an effective way to achieve this.
