# [Towards Effective Visual Representations for Partial-Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06080)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to improve partial-label learning (PLL) by learning better visual representations that can help disambiguate the candidate labels and identify the true label for each instance. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) Contrastive learning, as used in the prior work PiCO, is not optimal for PLL due to unreliable pseudo-positives selected based on noisy predictions. 

2) The direction of disambiguation guidance in PiCO, where the prototypical classifier guides the linear classifier, is improper as the linear classifier often makes more correct predictions early in training.

3) A better approach is to align the prototypical similarity distribution to the disambiguated probabilities from the linear classifier, encouraging the representations to reflect visual similarity between categories to improve label disambiguation.

4) Removing the unreliable contrastive learning module and reversing the direction of disambiguation guidance (linear classifier guiding prototypical classifier) will lead to better representations and superior PLL performance.

The proposed method PaPi is designed to test these hypotheses, demonstrating significantly improved PLL accuracy over prior state-of-the-art methods, especially under high ambiguity levels. The results provide empirical support for the hypotheses.
