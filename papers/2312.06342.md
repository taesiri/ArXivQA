# [Detecting Contextual Network Anomalies with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Detecting anomalies in network traffic is challenging due to the vast amount of traffic flows and their highly dynamic nature over time. Existing methods like PCA, EWMA and RNN have limitations in detecting contextual anomalies, where the traffic of a flow deviates from flows with similar past activity. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based solution for contextual anomaly detection in network traffic. The key ideas are:

(1) Represent traffic flows between origin-destination (OD) pairs as a graph, where nodes are flows and edges connect flows. 

(2) Use a GNN model to learn attention weights on edges that represent the contextual relationship between flows based on their past traffic patterns.

(3) The GNN model is trained to predict the next traffic value of a target flow using only context flows. Deviations between predictions and actual values are used to detect anomalies.

Main Contributions:

(1) Formulates network traffic anomaly detection as a contextual anomaly detection problem based on relationships between flows.

(2) Proposes a custom GNN architecture that learns flow contexts in an unsupervised manner and uses it to detect traffic deviations.

(3) Evaluation using 6 months of Abilene traffic data shows anomalies detected are quite complementary to PCA, EWMA and RNN.

(4) Analysis shows 64% of anomalies have high confidence and 18% have mid confidence based on manual validation.

(5) Identifies and analyses two main classes of anomalies detected: (i) flow deviation from context (ii) flow remains stable but context changes.

In summary, the paper presents a GNN based solution for contextual anomaly detection in network traffic that captures anomalies missed by other non-contextual methods.
