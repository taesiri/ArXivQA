# [Detecting Contextual Network Anomalies with Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06342)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) approach for detecting contextual anomalies in network traffic flows over time. The method represents origin-destination (OD) traffic flows as nodes in a graph and connects them to learn contextual relationships. A GNN model is trained in a self-supervised manner to predict the next OD flow value using only context flows, assigning attention weights to capture relevance between flows. Anomalies are detected by identifying when a flow deviates from its context. Evaluation on the Abilene dataset shows the method finds complementary anomalies to other techniques like PCA, EWMA and RNN, with over 60% not detected by the baselines. Further analysis by a network expert estimates 64% of the anomalies have high confidence and 18% medium confidence, indicating a significant portion reflect real network issues. The approach is tailored to amplify contextual anomaly detection compared to non-contextual methods. Key future work includes validating effectiveness on real-world labeled data and exploring Transformer models.
