 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel contrastive multi-view subspace clustering framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs). It extracts textural and spectral-spatial features as two complementary views to construct multi-view graphs. GCNs are utilized to aggregate neighborhood information in each view. Contrastive learning is introduced to maximize view consistency by pulling positive sample pairs closer and pushing negative samples apart. This allows the model to learn more robust features. The affinity matrices from the two views are fused using an attention mechanism to obtain a unified discriminative affinity matrix for final spectral clustering. Extensive experiments on four HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach, called CMSCGC, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art HSI clustering techniques. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component in CMSCGC. By effectively integrating multi-view information and contrastive learning within a GCN framework, CMSCGC advances the state-of-the-art in HSI clustering.
