# [Batch Universal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Large language models (LLMs) have gained popularity for their ability to generate human-like text. As predictors estimating the probability of word sequences, it is useful to evaluate their performance from a universal prediction perspective.
- Existing notions of regret and predictors are based on predicting entire sequences of length n. But LLMs are trained and tested on batches of data of length l. 
- This requires introducing a new form of regret called "batch regret" to fairly evaluate LLMs, which is proposed and analyzed in this paper.

Proposed Solution:
- Batch regret is defined as the difference between the loss of a candidate predictor and the loss of the true distribution, averaged over training batches and test batches.
- Two naive predictors are discussed but shown to be suboptimal. An add-constant batch predictor is proposed that estimates probabilities by combining counts from both training and test batches.
- Asymptotic analysis of batch regret is provided for:
   - Memoryless (IID) binary sources 
   - First-order binary Markov sources
- For Markov sources, bounds are given on regret from estimating initial distribution vs transition probabilities. An improved predictor form is proposed using all batch coordinates.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a new notion of batch regret suitable for evaluating universal prediction performance of LLMs
- Asymptotic analysis of batch regret rates for add-constant predictors, including an optimal form utilizing both training and test batches 
- Identification that both initial distribution and transition probability estimation contribute to Markov source regret
- A modified add-constant predictor form proposed for Markov sources utilizing additional batch coordinate information

The paper introduces batch regret to enable fair evaluation of modern LLMs, provides asymptotic analysis in binary IID and Markov cases, and proposes improved predictor forms to reduce this new notion of regret.
