# [VIDiff: Translating Videos via Multi-Modal Instructions with Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18837)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Video Instruction Diffusion (VIDiff), a novel unified framework for aligning various video tasks with human instructions. VIDiff treats video understanding tasks such as segmentation and enhancement as conditional video-to-video translation problems. It can translate input videos into desired outcomes based on textual or visual instructions. The authors design a multi-stage training pipeline to adapt a pre-trained text-to-image model for conditional video translation. They also propose an iterative inference approach to translate long videos while maintaining temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate VIDiff's effectiveness across tasks like video re-colorization, deblurring, inpainting, and editing. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons show performance improvements over existing methods. The unified modeling of multiple video tasks and the capability to follow instructions makes VIDiff a milestone towards artificial general intelligence in video domains. Key strengths include multi-modal condition modeling, applicability to diverse tasks, and support for long video translation.
