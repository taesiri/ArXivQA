# [Token Boosting for Robust Self-Supervised Visual Transformer   Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04175)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve the Visual Transformer's (VT's) ability to extract robust and reliable features during self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data? 

Specifically, the authors aim to tackle the problem where the input data used for self-supervised pre-training of VTs can be of low quality and unreliable (e.g. corrupted images, noisy skeleton data). They propose that pre-training VTs with such unreliable data can be challenging, especially when using the masked autoencoding approach where both the inputs and masked "ground truth" targets may be corrupted. 

To address this, the authors introduce a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) that can be incorporated into VTs to help them learn to extract clean and robust features during masked autoencoding pre-training, even when the input data contains corruptions and noise. The key hypothesis is that adding the proposed TBM module will improve the capability of VTs to handle unreliable data and learn useful representations.

In summary, the central research question is how to make VTs more robust to corrupted data during self-supervised pre-training, with the key proposal being the introduction of the TBM module that helps VTs extract reliable features from unreliable inputs. Experiments are conducted to validate whether the proposed approach can consistently improve VT performance on downstream tasks when pre-trained on corrupted data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve the robustness and reliability of features extracted by Visual Transformers (VTs) during self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Designing a TBM module that can be incorporated into multiple layers of a VT to boost the reliability of features/tokens, making them "cleaner" and more robust against corruptions and noise in the input data.

- Providing theoretical analysis to show how the TBM module can learn to extract robust features during masked autoencoding pre-training, even when both inputs and targets may be corrupted. 

- Conducting experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, 3D skeleton action recognition, and depth image classification, using real-world corrupted datasets. Results show that the proposed TBM consistently improves performance of downstream tasks by enhancing the features learned during self-supervised pre-training.

So in summary, the main novelty is proposing the TBM module to handle the challenging problem of pre-training VTs on unreliable and corrupted data, which is common in many real-world scenarios but not well addressed before. Both theoretical motivations and experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve robustness and performance on corrupted data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve the robustness and reliability of learned features in Visual Transformers during self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in robust self-supervised visual pre-training:

- The key idea of using a Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve robustness of visual transformers (VTs) during self-supervised pre-training is novel. Other works have explored improving robustness of VTs, but mainly in the context of supervised training or test-time robustness. Using TBM specifically for self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data is a new approach.

- Most prior work on handling corrupted visual data has focused on supervised training for specific tasks like skeleton action recognition or image classification. This paper tackles the problem from a different angle - improving self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data so the benefits transfer downstream. 

- The theoretical analysis on how TBM learns to extract cleaner features is a useful contribution. It provides justification on why the proposed approach works and how the pre-training drives TBM to produce robust features.

- The experiments systematically evaluate the impact of TBM on corrupted image classification, skeleton action recognition, and depth image classification. The consistent gains across these diverse tasks demonstrate the versatility of the approach.

- Compared to works that perform data reconstruction as a pre-processing step, the TBM operates at the feature level which seems more flexible and effective based on the results. The comparisons to data reconstruction techniques highlight this advantage.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel perspective to handling corrupted visual data by improving self-supervised pre-training. The theoretical and empirical results back up the efficacy of TBM. It moves beyond supervised robust training for individual tasks. The comprehensive experiments and analyses are also strengths of this paper compared to prior works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

1. Exploring the adaptation to unseen corruption types, i.e. unsupervised domain adaptation to new corruptions. The authors propose modifying TBM to generate α based on the input, allowing it to adapt flexibly to different inputs. 

2. Experimenting with other tasks involving noisy input data, such as pose estimation, 3D analysis, etc. The robustness capabilities of TBM could benefit these areas as well.

3. Incorporating TBM into unified models that tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. This could improve robustness for multi-task models.

4. Evaluating TBM on more real-world datasets with natural corruptions, beyond the synthetic corruptions in ImageNet-C. This could demonstrate benefits in practical scenarios. 

5. Exploring the use of TBM during semi-supervised pre-training, where limited labels are available. TBM may help learn from corrupted unlabeled data in this setting.

6. Applying TBM to other model architectures beyond Transformers, e.g. CNNs. This could extend the benefits more broadly.

7. Theoretical analysis on the properties and guarantees provided by TBM regarding robustness. This could provide better understanding.

In summary, the main future directions are: exploring adaptation to new corruptions, applying TBM to other tasks and models, evaluating on more real datasets, using TBM in semi-supervised settings, and further theoretical analysis. The overall goal is to extend TBM's benefits more broadly.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve the robustness of Vision Transformers (VTs) against unreliable and corrupted data during self-supervised pre-training. TBM is a plug-and-play module that can be incorporated into multiple layers of a VT and trained end-to-end. It contains an autoencoder that takes in features from the VT along with additional synthetic noise, and reconstructs cleaner features that are then fed into the next VT layer. Theoretical analysis shows that TBM's objective encourages learning of robust representations. Experiments on image classification, 3D skeleton action recognition, and depth image classification with corrupted data show that incorporating TBM into VTs improves performance over strong baselines. Overall, the paper demonstrates that TBM is an effective approach to boost VT robustness during self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve the robustness of visual transformers (VTs) when pre-training them in a self-supervised manner on corrupted or unreliable data. Self-supervised pre-training of VTs using masked autoencoding has become popular for learning semantically meaningful and generalizable features from unlabeled data. However, this can be challenging when the input data contains corruptions or noise, as both the inputs and masked "ground truth" targets used for reconstruction can be unreliable. 

To address this, the authors introduce the TBM which can be inserted into intermediate layers of a VT encoder. The TBM uses a technique to extract cleaner, more robust features from the incoming corrupted features. It does this by adding synthetic noise to the features, and training an autoencoder module to reconstruct the original features. Through mathematical analysis, the authors show the TBM can learn to produce "boosted" features that are closer estimates to the true uncorrupted features. Experiments on image classification, 3D skeleton action recognition, and depth image classification demonstrate that incorporating the TBM during self-supervised pre-training consistently improves downstream task performance when testing on corrupted data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve the robustness of visual transformers (VTs) when pre-trained on corrupted or unreliable data in a self-supervised manner. The TBM module takes in unreliable input features, adds synthetic Gaussian noise to it, and uses an autoencoder to reconstruct an estimate of the original unreliable features. This estimate is then combined with the noisy input to produce boosted features that are cleaner and more reliable. The key idea is that the autoencoder learns to extract the reliable components from the input, since it cannot distinguish between the synthetic and natural corruptions. Multiple TBM modules can be incorporated into the VT encoder at different layers. The entire VT + TBM model is trained end-to-end with a masked autoencoding objective, which forces the model to learn robust representations. Experiments on corrupted image classification, skeleton action recognition, and depth image classification show consistent improvements in downstream task performance when using the proposed TBM during self-supervised pre-training.
