# [Token Boosting for Robust Self-Supervised Visual Transformer   Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04175)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we improve the Visual Transformer's (VT's) ability to extract robust and reliable features during self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data? Specifically, the authors aim to tackle the problem where the input data used for self-supervised pre-training of VTs can be of low quality and unreliable (e.g. corrupted images, noisy skeleton data). They propose that pre-training VTs with such unreliable data can be challenging, especially when using the masked autoencoding approach where both the inputs and masked "ground truth" targets may be corrupted. To address this, the authors introduce a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) that can be incorporated into VTs to help them learn to extract clean and robust features during masked autoencoding pre-training, even when the input data contains corruptions and noise. The key hypothesis is that adding the proposed TBM module will improve the capability of VTs to handle unreliable data and learn useful representations.In summary, the central research question is how to make VTs more robust to corrupted data during self-supervised pre-training, with the key proposal being the introduction of the TBM module that helps VTs extract reliable features from unreliable inputs. Experiments are conducted to validate whether the proposed approach can consistently improve VT performance on downstream tasks when pre-trained on corrupted data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel Token Boosting Module (TBM) to improve the robustness and reliability of features extracted by Visual Transformers (VTs) during self-supervised pre-training on corrupted data. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Designing a TBM module that can be incorporated into multiple layers of a VT to boost the reliability of features/tokens, making them "cleaner" and more robust against corruptions and noise in the input data.- Providing theoretical analysis to show how the TBM module can learn to extract robust features during masked autoencoding pre-training, even when both inputs and targets may be corrupted. - Conducting experiments on multiple tasks, including image classification, 3D skeleton action recognition, and depth image classification, using real-world corrupted datasets. Results show that the proposed TBM consistently improves performance of downstream tasks by enhancing the features learned during self-supervised pre-training.So in summary, the main novelty is proposing the TBM module to handle the challenging problem of pre-training VTs on unreliable and corrupted data, which is common in many real-world scenarios but not well addressed before. Both theoretical motivations and experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively improve robustness and performance on corrupted data.
