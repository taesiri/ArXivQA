# [Bandit Structured Prediction for Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06497)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes methods for training neural sequence-to-sequence models under bandit structured prediction, where the model receives only partial feedback on its predictions rather than full supervision. The authors build on prior work on linear structured prediction under bandit feedback and extend it to non-linear models based on recurrent neural networks. They introduce algorithms for optimizing expected loss and pairwise ranking objectives using techniques like score function gradients and control variates to reduce variance. The methods are evaluated on a neural machine translation domain adaptation task, where a model trained on one domain is adapted to a new domain using only simulated bandit feedback. Without any parallel in-domain data, the bandit learned models improve over 4-6 BLEU points over seed models by exploiting the weak feedback. The techniques introduced also maintain performance on the original domain, allowing conservative domain adaptation. Overall, the proposed combination of neural sequence-to-sequence learning under bandit objectives allows training with less supervision, enabling adaptation to user needs just from feedback on model predictions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper lifts linear structured prediction under bandit feedback to neural sequence-to-sequence learning for domain adaptation in neural machine translation, achieving improvements of up to 5.89 BLEU through simulated weak feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

Lifting linear structured prediction under bandit feedback to non-linear sequence-to-sequence learning using recurrent neural networks with attention. Specifically, the paper introduces algorithms to train neural machine translation models under numerical feedback to single output structures or under preference rankings over pairs of structures. This allows the models to perform domain adaptation using only weak feedback rather than full sentence-level references.

The paper shows experimentally that this approach can yield substantial BLEU score improvements over out-of-domain seed models for neural machine translation domain adaptation, outperforming also prior linear bandit learning models. The paper also explores techniques like control variates to improve learning speed and generalization of the models.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting methods for neural sequence-to-sequence bandit structured prediction, evaluating them for neural machine translation domain adaptation, and showing significant improvements over baseline models using only simulated weak feedback.

The paper focuses on adapting neural machine translation models to new domains using only weak feedback signals, rather than full reference translations. It lifts existing bandit structured prediction algorithms to the neural sequence-to-sequence learning setting. Key ideas include the expected loss and pairwise preference objectives, techniques to generate useful samples, and the incorporation of control variates to reduce variance. The experimental section evaluates these methods on French-English domain adaptation tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes lifting linear bandit structured prediction models to nonlinear sequence-to-sequence models. What are some key challenges in making this transition from linear to nonlinear models? How do the authors address these challenges?

2. The paper evaluates the proposed methods on a neural machine translation domain adaptation task. What makes this an appropriate testbed? What aspects of the task and evaluation setup are critical for effectively evaluating the methods?

3. The authors propose techniques for sampling output structures from the neural sequence-to-sequence models. What considerations go into designing effective sampling strategies? How do choices like sampling full sequences versus individual words impact learning?

4. A core aspect of bandit learning is the balance between exploration and exploitation. How do the sampling strategies used in this paper balance these two factors? Could the strategies be improved to better handle this tradeoff?  

5. The paper introduces techniques like UNK word replacement and byte-pair encoding to handle unknown words. How central are these techniques to enabling effective learning? What are their major limitations? Could they be improved or replaced?

6. Control variates are proposed to reduce variance and improve generalization. What intuition is behind these techniques? Under what conditions would you expect them to have a bigger or smaller impact?

7. What assumptions does the learning framework make about the availability of human feedback/evaluation of model outputs? How realistic are these assumptions and what issues might arise in practice?

8. The model is evaluated by simulating human feedback. What are the risks of using simulated rather than real human feedback? How could the experimental design be altered to better measure real-world viability?  

9. The techniques are evaluated only on French-English translation. What other language pairs or sequence transduction tasks could they apply to? Would the techniques need to be modified or adapted?

10. The improvements demonstrated on the machine translation task are modest compared to fully supervised approaches. What major challenges remain in making bandit learning truly competitive with supervised methods? How might these be addressed?
