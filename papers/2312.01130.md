# [STREAM: Software Tool for Routing Efficiently Advanced Macrofluidics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01130)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Manual assembly of fluidic circuits for soft robots is arduous, error-prone and time-consuming as the complexity increases. 
- Existing fabrication techniques like lithography or expensive 3D printers have limited accessibility.
- There is a lack of software tools to automate the design and fabrication process of fluidic circuits.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a software add-on for Blender to automatically generate 3D printable fluidic networks from circuit diagrams.
- They introduce a library of easy-to-print fluidic logic components optimized for fused deposition modeling (FDM). 
- The software routes tubing paths between components using a customized A* path finding algorithm.
- Monolithic fluidic circuits are printed, requiring only attachment of separate logic gates.

Main Contributions:
- Software tool and FDM-optimized component library enabling automated design and fabrication of fluidic circuits with desktop printers.
- Customized tubing routing algorithm that is efficient and optimized for 3D printing.  
- Demonstration of complete pipeline - from circuit diagram to software layout to 3D printed pneumatic ring oscillator and full adder.
- Approach democratizes implementation of fluidic control beyond specialized labs.

In summary, the paper presents a software solution to simplify and automate the design and fabrication process for pneumatic circuits aimed at controlling soft robots. The ability to 3D print monolithic fluidic networks using inexpensive desktop printers and attach optimized logic components enables more accessible implementation of fluidic computing.
