# [Exploring the Viability of Synthetic Audio Data for Audio-Based Dialogue   State Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01842)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using synthetic audio data generated by text-to-speech models as a viable alternative to real human speech data for training audio-based dialogue state tracking (DST) models. The authors create a multi-turn synthetic audio dataset called SynthWOZ by combining existing text dialogue datasets with state-of-the-art TTS models. They carefully preprocess the text and incorporate utterances from both users and systems over multiple turns to provide conversational context. The dataset has utterances from 10 distinct voices to promote generalization. The authors develop cascading and end-to-end neural baseline models for audio-based DST, train them solely on SynthWOZ, and test on real human recordings. They introduce a PhonemeF1 evaluation metric to assess pronunciation similarity. Results show models trained on synthetic data can generalize reasonably well to human speech. Using multiple speakers and incorporating both user and system turns helps the models generalize better compared to single speaker and user-only turns. The cascading model performs better in tracking named entities while the end-to-end model does better in classifying categorical slot values. The analysis provides insights into the viability of using synthetic speech to train audio-based DST models to eliminate dependency on expensive human speech data collection.
