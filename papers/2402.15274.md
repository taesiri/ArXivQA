# [Classification Under Strategic Self-Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15274)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the problem of classification when the subjects being predicted (e.g. job candidates, loan applicants) can behave strategically, specifically by deciding whether or not to participate based on the learned classifier. This introduces a feedback loop between the predictor and the distribution it faces at test time. The paper refers to this as "learning under self-selection". The key research questions are: (1) what are the effects of self-selection on conventional learning methods, (2) how to design a strategically-robust learning method, (3) whether learning can influence self-selection to shape the population, and (4) how to mitigate potential negative effects.

Proposed Solution:
The paper formally models the strategic behavior using utility theory. Applicants apply if the expected gain from potential qualification outweighs the costs. Since true outcomes are unknown a-priori, applicants use public aggregate statistics like precision to inform beliefs. The paper proposes an approach to directly optimize a smooth differentiable proxy for accuracy on the resulting self-selective distribution. This accounts for the dependence between learning and applications via parameterized application probabilities for each example. Independence constraints are also introduced to restrict the capacity to influence applications.  

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes learning under strategic self-selection and studies effects on conventional methods
- Shows learning can exploit informational advantage to determine applications
- Proposes differentiable method to directly optimize induced performance 
- Introduces constraints based on statistical parity to restrict excessive influence
- Demonstrates approach on real data with simulated behavior and analyzes performance

Overall, the paper provides both analysis and methods to account for potential self-selective effects in societally impactful machine learning systems. Key innovation is optimizing for accuracy on the decision-dependent distribution arising from human responses to the predictor itself.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper studies classification with strategic agents who choose whether to participate based on their expected utility, proposes an effective differentiable method for learning classifiers that anticipate and optimize for the induced self-selective distribution, and analyzes the interplay between learning, strategic behavior, and resulting applicant populations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It studies a novel setting of classification under strategic self-selection, where prediction targets (e.g. job candidates) choose whether to participate/apply based on the learned classifier. This is in contrast to most prior work on strategic classification which focuses on feature modification actions.

2) It analyzes how different levels of "strategic awareness" in the learning algorithm (from naive to fully strategic) affect and are affected by the process of self-selection. This includes studying the firm's power to influence self-selection outcomes.

3) It proposes an affirmative action approach based on targeted subsidies, enabled by enforcing a statistical parity constraint on the classifier. This can allow a social planner to promote application from certain groups.

4) It provides a differentiable method for optimizing the strategic learning objective, which can account for the interdependence between the classifier and self-selective behavior. This is based on a smoothed application decision rule and precision proxy.

5) It empirically demonstrates the proposed approach on real-world data with simulated strategic behavior, comparing it to other natural baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is in formalizing and studying classification in the presence of strategic self-selective behavior, including both analysis and methods for learning.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Strategic classification
- Self-selection
- Screening
- Conditional precision
- Induced distribution
- Decision-dependent distribution shift
- Strategic power
- Statistical parity
- Affirmative action
- Targeted subsidies
- Differentiable learning

The paper studies classification settings where the subjects being predicted can choose whether or not to participate based on the classifier itself. This is referred to as strategic classification under self-selection. The paper analyzes how different classifiers induce different applicant distributions based on their conditional precision metrics. It also examines the strategic power that firms have in shaping self-selection, and proposes constraints like statistical parity to restrict this power. Methods for affirmative action via targeted subsidies are discussed. Finally, the paper presents a differentiable learning approach for directly optimizing strategic objectives that account for self-selection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a differentiable framework for learning under strategic self-selection. Can you explain in detail how the framework handles the discrete nature of the application decisions $a_i^*$? What is the motivation behind using a continuous surrogate $\tilde{a}_i$ instead?

2) One key challenge discussed is that the precision metric depends on the predictions $\hat{y}$ of the classifier being optimized. How exactly does the method address this circular dependence in order to make precision differentiable? Can you walk through the details of the proposed precision proxy? 

3) The method uses a corrected version of the precision proxy to address potential biases. What is the source of this bias and how does the corrective term $\text{bias}$ alleviate it? Provide a detailed explanation.

4) Explain the rationale behind the application and precision penalty term $R_{app}$ added to the objective function. What feasibility issues does it aim to resolve? How does it balance enabling application against potential harm to optimization?

5) The independence constraint for limiting strategic power is approximated using a regularization penalty $R_{\perp}$. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this approach compared to explicitly enforcing statistical parity. What hyperparameters control the strength of independence enforcement? 

6) From an optimization perspective, discuss the non-convex nature of the strategic learning problem. What steps were taken in the experiments to cope with challenges like convergence to poor local minima?

7) The method relies on several temperature hyperparameters that control smoothing and sigmoid sharpness. Provide specific examples explaining how these can impact learning dynamics and performance.

8) One could alternately address self-selection by modifying the sampling distribution instead of using sample weights. Compare and contrast the two approaches - what are the pros and cons? When might one be preferred over the other?

9) How does the choice of the subset of features $\mathbf{z}$ that determine the published statistics influence learning and applications? Discuss considerations in selecting which statistics to reveal.

10) The paper focuses on a single deployment setting. How might the framework and analysis extend to handling strategic self-selection over multiple rounds of adaptation? Discuss the potential performative effects.
