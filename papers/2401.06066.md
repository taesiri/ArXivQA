# [DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in   Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture called \spmoe{} for building large-scale language models. The key idea is to achieve "ultimate expert specialization", meaning each expert acquires non-overlapping, focused and specialized knowledge. This is an improvement over conventional MoE architectures like GShard that struggle to ensure expert specialization.

The paper addresses two main issues in existing MoE architectures: 
1) Knowledge hybridity: Limited number of experts forces each expert to accumulate diverse types of knowledge, which is hard to fully utilize. 
2) Knowledge redundancy: Tokens routed to different experts may require common knowledge, causing redundancy across experts.

To handle these issues, \spmoe{} incorporates two main strategies:

1) Fine-grained expert segmentation: By splitting experts into a finer grain (e.g. 16 experts into 64 sub-experts) while keeping computation budget constant, more flexible expert combinations are possible. This allows more precise decomposition of knowledge into focused experts.

2) Shared expert isolation: Certain experts are isolated to exclusively capture common knowledge across contexts. This reduces redundancy in other experts, enabling them to specialize more. 

The paper validates \spmoe{} extensively. At 2B parameters, \spmoe{} matches the performance of a GShard model with 1.5x more capacity. It also reaches the performance upper bound of MoE architectures set by an equivalent dense model. Ablations and analyses provide evidence of higher expert specialization in \spmoe{}.

When scaled to 16B parameters, \spmoe{} achieves comparable performance to the 7B LLaMA2 model while using only ~40% of the computation. A chat model is also created via supervised fine tuning. Early results on scaling further to 145B parameters show that \spmoe{} consistently outperforms the GShard architecture.

To summarize, this paper makes the following key contributions:

1) Introduces innovative \spmoe{} architecture for higher expert specialization via fine-grained segmentation and shared experts.

2) Empirically validates advantages of \spmoe{} - reaches performance upper bound at 2B parameters and matches 7B LLaMA2 at 16B parameters with lower computation.

3) Demonstrates successful alignment into chat model at 16B scale.

4) Shows consistent gains over GShard up to 145B parameters.

The paper has strong results showing \spmoe{} better utilizes model capacity through expert specialization, enabling computational savings. The techniques show promise to efficiently scale large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a mixture-of-experts architecture called DeepSeek MoE that achieves superior expert specialization through fine-grained expert segmentation and shared expert isolation, enabling efficient scaling to 16 billion parameters while matching the performance of dense models with over 2 times more compute.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Architectural Innovation: The authors introduce DeepSeek MoE, an innovative Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture aiming at achieving ultimate expert specialization through two principal strategies - fine-grained expert segmentation and shared expert isolation.

2) Empirical Validation: The authors conduct extensive experiments to empirically validate the effectiveness of the DeepSeek MoE architecture. At a scale of 2B parameters, experimental results validate the high level of expert specialization in DeepSeek MoE 2B, and indicate that it can nearly approach the theoretical upper bound performance for MoE models.

3) Scalability: The authors scale up DeepSeek MoE to train a 16B model and show that with only about 40% of computations, DeepSeek MoE 16B achieves comparable performance with DeepSeek 7B and LLaMA2 7B. They also undertake a preliminary endeavor to scale it up to 145B parameters, consistently validating its advantages over the GShard architecture. 

4) Alignment for MoE: The authors successfully perform supervised fine-tuning on DeepSeek MoE 16B to create an aligned chat model, demonstrating the adaptability and versatility of the architecture.

5) Public Release: The model checkpoint of DeepSeek MoE 16B is released to the public to provide valuable insights for research and industry, and contribute to the advancement of large-scale language models.
