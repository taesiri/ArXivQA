# [Language Imbalance Can Boost Cross-lingual Generalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07982)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work has shown parallel data and shared vocabulary ("anchor points") facilitate cross-lingual generalisation in multilingual language models (LMs). However, the role of language imbalance in training data is not well understood. 

- Experiments with cloned languages (duplicated vocabularies, perfect equivalence) show LMs do not generalise well across languages when trained on balanced (50/50) data. Surprisingly, multilingual training often hurts performance compared to monolingual models.

Methodology:
- Conduct controlled experiments with cloned English languages to isolate effects of language imbalance, gives upper bound on potential for generalisation between real languages.

- Also run experiments on English-French with both disjoint and merged ("anchored") vocabularies.

- Analyse model perplexity, downstream task accuracy, representation alignment, gradient similarity across languages. 

- Vary ratio of languages during training, model capacity, training set size. Also explore language sampling schedules.

Key Findings:
- With cloned languages, language imbalance significantly improves generalisation and alignment of representations, especially with larger models/longer training. 

- Real languages also benefit from imbalance, but effects are weaker. No clear evidence that imbalance causes better alignment of representations.

- For cloned languages, sampling schedules leverage imbalance to improve performance without changing dataset. Harder to improve both real languages.

- Language imbalance seems to force model to share components across cloned languages. Effect less pronounced for distinct real languages.

Contributions:
- First systematic study of effect of language imbalance on multilingual LMs
- Insights into dynamics of sharing computations across languages during training
- Training schemes that can improve cloned language performance without changing data


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how training language models on imbalanced mixes of languages, with one dominant language, can improve their ability to generalize knowledge across languages, finding this works well for cloned languages but the effect is less clear for real languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is identifying language imbalance as a novel driver of cross-lingual generalization in multilingual language models. Specifically:

- In controlled experiments with cloned languages, the paper finds that having a predominant "main language" during training significantly boosts the performance of less frequent languages and leads to stronger alignment of representations across languages. This effect is amplified with larger models and longer training.

- The paper shows that training curricula that introduce language imbalance (while keeping the overall language distribution balanced) can improve performance on all cloned languages.

- When extending the analysis to real languages, the paper finds that lower resource languages still tend to benefit from higher resource ones, but whether language imbalance itself causes cross-lingual generalization is less clear.

In summary, the key insight is that language imbalance can be beneficial for cross-lingual generalization and performance on low-resource languages in some settings, contrary to common practices that aim for balanced multilingual data. The paper provides a systematic investigation of this phenomenon in both controlled cloned language settings as well as more realistic multilingual modeling.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Cross-lingual generalisation - The paper investigates whether and how multilingual language models are able to generalise concepts and patterns learned in one language to other languages. This is referred to as cross-lingual generalisation.

- Language imbalance - The paper studies the effect of having an imbalanced mix of languages in the training data, with one language being much more frequent than others. This unequal distribution is termed language imbalance. 

- Cloned languages - The paper introduces cloned languages, which are perfectly equivalent duplicate versions of a language, only differing in their vocabulary symbols. Experiments with cloned languages allow studying cross-lingual generalisation in isolation of other confounding factors.

- Representation alignment - The degree to which a multilingual model's internal representations of concepts are aligned or shared across languages. This alignment enables cross-lingual generalisation and is measured in the paper.

- Anchor points - Shared vocabulary items that exist across languages. These are found to facilitate cross-lingual generalisation.

- Language sampling schedule - Strategies for varying the sampling of different languages during the training process over time. The paper tests whether these can improve generalisation.

In summary, the key focus is on understanding cross-lingual generalisation dynamics in multilingual models and how factors like language imbalance and anchor points affect the degree of representation alignment and generalisation across languages.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper finds that language imbalance improves cross-lingual generalization between cloned languages but the effect is weaker for real languages. Why might this be the case? What differences between cloned and real languages could explain this discrepancy?

2. The authors design language sampling schedules for cloned languages that improve performance on both languages. Why do these schedules not transfer well to real languages? What are some possible ways the schedules could be adapted to be more effective for real languages? 

3. The paper argues that prolonged training leads cloned language models to overfit, hurting cross-lingual generalization. However, this effect seems less pronounced for real languages. What factors might mitigate overfitting in the real language case?  

4. For cloned languages, the benefits of language imbalance seem to increase with model scale. Is there a theoretical argument or complexity measure that could explain why larger models benefit more from imbalance?

5. The gradient alignment measure does not show higher similarity for imbalanced models on real languages. What are some possible alternative quantitative measures of cross-lingual representation alignment one could use instead?

6. How might the effect of language imbalance change if even more languages (e.g. 10 or 100) were used instead of just 2 or 10? What theoretical arguments or preliminary experiments could provide insight here?

7. What kinds of language similarities other than parallel sentences could be used as a signal to measure cross-lingual generalization? Are there any that might correlate better with performance than gradient alignment?  

8. Could curriculum learning principles or techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting be useful for designing better language sampling schedules? If so, how might they be adapted?

9. For real languages, language imbalance provides less benefit with increased training. Is there any evidence this trend would continue with even longer training or does it plateau? What mechanisms could explain this?

10. What kinds of modifications to model architecture could make models generalize better across either cloned or real languages? Are there any architectural choices that might improve gradient alignment specifically?
