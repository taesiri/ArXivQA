# [Monitored Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Monitored Markov Decision Processes":

Problem:
- In reinforcement learning (RL), agents typically assume they can always observe the rewards generated by the environment in response to their actions. However, in many real-world settings, rewards may not always be observable due to lack of instrumentation, unavailability of human experts, faulty sensors, etc.
- Existing RL frameworks like POMDPs, sparse rewards, cautious RL, etc. do not fully capture such complexities where rewards are generated but not always observable. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new RL framework called "Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs)" to model such situations. 
- In Mon-MDPs, the observability of rewards from the environment is controlled by a separate stochastic process called the "monitor". The monitor has its own states, actions and dynamics.  
- At each timestep, the agent selects joint actions for both the environment and the monitor. The environment generates a reward but the agent observes a "proxy" reward based on the monitor state and action. The proxy can be the actual reward or a special "unobservable" value.
- The agent must learn to maximize long-term rewards from the environment, while only observing proxy rewards from the monitor.

Contributions:
- Formalizes the problem of unobservable rewards in RL through Mon-MDPs.
- Discusses theoretical consequences like non-existence of optimal policies.
- Empirically demonstrates challenges through gridworld experiments, e.g. ignoring unobservable rewards can lead to dangerous behaviors.
- Proposes model-based RL algorithm with reward prediction that can converge to optimal policies under certain conditions.
- Positions Mon-MDPs as a powerful new formalism unifying problems like active RL, partial monitoring, etc. while enabling modeling of more complex real-world situations.
- Lays theoretical and empirical foundation for future work in learning under limited reward observability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs), a new reinforcement learning framework that accounts for situations where rewards generated by the environment in response to the agent's actions are not always observable, formalizing the concept of a separate monitor process that determines reward observability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper formally introduces Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs), a new reinforcement learning framework to account for situations where the agent cannot always observe the rewards generated by the environment. The key contributions are:

1) Formalizing the concept of a "monitor" as a separate MDP that determines if and how the agent observes the environment's rewards. This allows modeling complex real-world scenarios where reward observability depends on external factors. 

2) Discussing theoretical properties of Mon-MDPs, including conditions for guaranteeing convergence to an optimal policy despite unobserved rewards.

3) Empirically demonstrating through toy environments the challenges that arise from reward unobservability, and how standard RL algorithms can fail in this setting.

4) Proposing algorithmic modifications, like using a learned reward model, that allow handling unobserved rewards and converging to an optimal policy.

5) Situating Mon-MDPs as a novel framework that generalizes both active reinforcement learning and partial monitoring in bandits to the sequential decision making setting.

In summary, the main contribution is the formalization of Mon-MDPs as a new RL setting that can capture important complexities of real-world problems, together with an analysis of the theoretical and practical consequences of this framework.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Monitored Markov Decision Processes (Mon-MDPs) - The novel RL framework proposed in the paper where reward observability is governed by a separate "monitor" process.

- Monitor - The process in a Mon-MDP that determines if and how the agent observes rewards from the environment. Has its own state space, action space, dynamics, etc.

- Proxy rewards - The rewards that the agent actually observes in a Mon-MDP, which may be modified or filtered by the monitor and can be unobservable.

- Unsolvable Mon-MDPs - Mon-MDPs where it is impossible to learn an optimal policy due to fundamental unobservability of rewards.

- Active reinforcement learning - An existing area of RL research that is related to but more limited than Mon-MDPs in addressing unobservable rewards.

- Partial monitoring - Another related framework from the multi-armed bandit literature that deals with imperfect/incomplete feedback.

- Ergodic monitor - A monitor that allows the observability of all environment reward over infinite exploration.

- Truthful monitor - A monitor that either shows the true environment reward or unobservable reward, but does not falsely alter rewards.

Some other key terms are environment and monitor rewards, monitor state transitions, indistinguishability of Mon-MDPs, solvability, and exploration challenges in Mon-MDPs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes Monitored MDPs (Mon-MDPs) as a new reinforcement learning framework to account for situations where rewards may not always be observable. How is the concept of a separate "monitor" process in Mon-MDPs more flexible and realistic compared to simply using partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) to handle unobserved rewards?

2. The paper argues that current RL frameworks do not capture the full complexity of many real-world tasks. Can you elaborate 2-3 examples of complex real-world tasks that Mon-MDPs can represent more accurately than regular MDPs? What specific complexities do Mon-MDPs capture that regular MDPs cannot?

3. Proposition 1 states sufficient conditions for the existence of an algorithm that can converge to an optimal policy in a Mon-MDP. Can you explain the rationale behind each of the 3 conditions (ergodic Mon-MDP, ergodic monitor function, truthful monitor function)? Why is satisfying all 3 critical?  

4. The paper empirically evaluates 5 algorithms on 3 Mon-MDPs. Can you analyze the behaviors and failure modes of algorithms 1-4 in detail? What intuitions do the learned policies reveal about the underlying challenges of Mon-MDPs?

5. Algorithm 5 uses a learned reward model to handle unobserved rewards. Formally prove why this approach enables convergence to an optimal policy under the conditions of Proposition 1. What are the limitations of relying solely on a learned model?

6. The empirical evaluation surface some key difficulties that algorithms face in solving Mon-MDPs such as the N-Monitor, Limited-Time, and Limited-Use environments. Pick one environment and analyze the specific exploration challenge it poses. How can we design more sophisticated exploration strategies?

7. The paper discusses different taxonomies of Mon-MDPs such as solvable vs unsolvable and hopeless vs non-hopeless environments. Define these categories formally and discuss what kind of behaviors could be learned in non-hopeless unsolvable Mon-MDPs.

8. One could frame the problem setup in Mon-MDPs using semi-MDPs instead by handling unobserved rewards through delayed rewards. Discuss the limitations of this alternative formulation and why explicitly modeling the monitor as a separate process is more suitable.

9. The monitor in Mon-MDPs dictates reward observability but does not directly affect the environment rewards. Discuss how this separation facilitates better generalization and transfer learning compared to formulations that couple the monitor and environment.

10. The paper sets the stage for future work in Mon-MDPs. Pick one proposed research direction and elaborate how you would formulate and study that problem in-depth. What methodology would you use? Why is it an important open question?
