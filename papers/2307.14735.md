# [Test Time Adaptation for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop test time adaptation techniques to improve the performance of blind image quality assessment models under distribution shift between training and test data?The key hypothesis is that by using suitable auxiliary self-supervised tasks during test time adaptation, the model can learn to adapt to the test data distribution and improve prediction performance compared to just using the source pre-trained model.In particular, the two novel auxiliary tasks proposed are:1) Group contrastive learning to discriminate between low and high quality images in a test batch. 2) Rank ordering between two distorted versions of a test image to maintain relative quality relationships.The overall hypothesis is that optimizing a combination of these two losses that capture quality-relevant information can enable effective test time adaptation for blind IQA without requiring access to the original training data. The experiments aim to validate if the proposed approach can improve multiple pre-trained IQA models on unseen test datasets compared to the source models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing test time adaptation techniques for blind image quality assessment (IQA) models to mitigate distribution shifts between training and test data. 2. Formulating two novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks to enable test time adaptation in IQA:- Group contrastive (GC) loss that contrasts groups of low and high quality images in a batch to capture quality discriminative information.- Rank loss that maintains the quality order between two different distorted versions of the same image.3. Demonstrating that the proposed TTA method can significantly improve the performance of four different quality-aware source models on four different test IQA databases. Even using a small batch of test images helps achieve noticeable gains.4. The two losses are complementary - GC loss works better when quality separation in a batch is high, while rank loss works better when batch quality is similar. Their combination handles diverse scenarios.5. Showing the importance of quality-aware losses for IQA model adaptation, as compared to a generic rotation prediction task.In summary, the main contribution appears to be in designing tailored auxiliary tasks using rank and contrastive losses to enable test time adaptation for blind IQA models, without requiring the original training data. The approach is shown to work across diverse IQA models and test databases.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of test time adaptation for blind image quality assessment:- This is one of the first works to explore test time adaptation specifically for blind image quality assessment. Most prior work on test time adaptation has focused on image classification tasks. The authors introduce new quality-aware losses designed for adapting IQA models.- The proposed group contrastive loss and rank loss provide complementary benefits. The group contrastive loss helps discriminate batches with diverse quality levels, while the rank loss works well even when batch images have similar quality. Their combination handles various test scenarios.- The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method by improving multiple state-of-the-art NR IQA models over 4 different benchmark datasets. Many works in TTA only show gains on classification. Showing consistent gains across datasets and models highlights the reliability. - Most TTA methods require access to source training data. A key benefit here is the authors consider source-free TTA applicable to pre-trained IQA models without retraining them.- The gains are shown on diverse authentic and synthetic distortions. Many recent IQA methods focus on authentic distortions. Showing benefits on both types of distortions demonstrates wider applicability.- Ablation studies provide useful insights on the design choices such as group size, number of groups, distortion types for rank loss, etc. The analysis helps understand what drives the performance gains.- While the gains over source models are significant, there is still scope for improvement in terms of absolute performance on challenging datasets like PIPAL. Advancing TTA further would be an interesting future work.Overall, this paper makes important contributions in designing and demonstrating TTA for blind IQA under various practical scenarios. The quality-aware losses and detailed experiments advance the state-of-the-art in adaptation methods for IQA.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring different auxiliary tasks for test time adaptation in IQA. The authors introduced two new auxiliary tasks - group contrastive learning and rank ordering - for IQA. They suggest exploring other novel auxiliary tasks that can capture quality-relevant information to help adaptation.- Applying the proposed TTA approach to video quality assessment. The authors primarily focus on image quality assessment in this work. They suggest it would be interesting to study the role of TTA for video quality assessment as well since videos have temporal dependencies that images lack. - Understanding the impact of adapting different components, like the transformer layers, as part of the feature extractor during TTA. The authors only adapt the batch normalization layers in their experiments. Evaluating what happens when other components like attention are adapted could reveal further insights.- Evaluating the performance of TTA-IQA on more diverse authentic distortion datasets captured using different devices under various conditions. The authors already demonstrate significant improvements on four datasets, but testing on more real-world distorted datasets can help better analyze the benefits.- Exploring how the amount of test data provided for adaptation affects the performance improvements. The authors use batches of 8 images for TTA in their experiments. Varying the batch size during adaptation could provide more insights.- Developing theoretical guarantees for convergence and performance improvement from TTA for IQA. The empirical results demonstrate clear gains, but having theoretical analysis can further strengthen the foundation.In summary, the authors provide a strong motivation for continued research on test time adaptation techniques to deal with domain shifts in blind image quality assessment models in real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a test time adaptation (TTA) method to improve the performance of blind image quality assessment (IQA) models when there is a distribution shift between the training and test data. The authors introduce two novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks - a group contrastive loss and a relative rank loss - to enable quality-aware adaptation of a pre-trained source model using batches of unlabeled test images. The group contrastive loss contrasts groups of low and high quality images in a batch based on pseudo-labels from the source model. The relative rank loss ranks the quality of different levels of distortion for each test image. Experiments on four IQA datasets and four state-of-the-art source models show that the proposed TTA method significantly improves performance over the source models by aligning features to the target distribution. The method is effective even with a small batch of test images by adapting batch normalization statistics.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a test time adaptation method for blind image quality assessment (IQA) models to improve their generalization performance. The key idea is to adapt a pre-trained IQA model to the test data distribution at inference time without requiring the original training data. The authors introduce two novel auxiliary self-supervised tasks - a group contrastive loss and a relative rank loss. The group contrastive loss tries to discriminate between groups of low and high quality images in a test batch by contrasting their feature representations. The rank loss captures relative quality relationships between two distorted versions of each test image. Combining these complementary losses helps the model adapt better across diverse distortion types and quality ranges. The proposed method is evaluated by adapting four state-of-the-art IQA models on four benchmark databases with authentic and synthetic distortions. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over the original pre-trained models, highlighting the importance of test time adaptation. The method also outperforms a baseline using rotation prediction, showing the efficacy of the proposed quality-aware losses for IQA model adaptation. Ablation studies reveal the complementary nature of the two losses. The authors also analyze the impact of various design choices such as group size, number of iterations etc. Overall, the paper presents an effective approach to handle train-test distribution shifts for blind IQA through novel adaptation techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper proposes a test time adaptation (TTA) technique for blind image quality assessment (IQA) to mitigate distribution shifts between training and test data. The authors introduce two novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks - a group contrastive (GC) loss and a relative rank loss, to enable quality-aware adaptation. For the GC loss, images in a test batch are divided into high and low quality groups based on pseudo-labels from a pre-trained source model. The loss brings features from the same group closer while pushing apart features from different groups. For the rank loss, two degraded versions of each test image are generated, and the relative distance-based rank between them is matched with the ground truth order. While GC loss relies on batch diversity, rank loss works better when quality variation is less. By optimizing a combination of these losses on the batch normalization layers of the source model, the test time features become more discriminative of quality. Experiments show significant gains over multiple source models on diverse datasets.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about this paper are:- It addresses the problem of distribution shift between training and test data for blind image quality assessment (IQA) models. Blind IQA refers to predicting image quality without access to a reference image.- Most IQA models perform poorly when tested on data from a different distribution than their training data. This is known as the domain shift problem. - The paper proposes a test time adaptation (TTA) method to adapt pre-trained IQA models to the test data distribution at inference time, without requiring the original training data. This is called source-free adaptation.- Two novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks are introduced for TTA of IQA models - a group contrastive loss and a relative rank loss. These losses help the model adapt in a quality-aware manner.- The group contrastive loss contrasts groups of low and high quality images within a test batch to learn discriminative quality features. - The rank loss enforces correct quality ranking between two differently distorted versions of each test image.- Experiments show significant improvement over source models by using the proposed TTA method on four IQA databases. The method outperforms other self-supervised tasks like rotation prediction.In summary, the key contribution is a test time adaptation technique to address domain shift issues for blind IQA models by using novel quality-aware self-supervised auxiliary tasks. The method does not require access to original training data.
