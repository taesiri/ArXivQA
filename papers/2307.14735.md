# [Test Time Adaptation for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop test time adaptation techniques to improve the performance of blind image quality assessment models under distribution shift between training and test data?The key hypothesis is that by using suitable auxiliary self-supervised tasks during test time adaptation, the model can learn to adapt to the test data distribution and improve prediction performance compared to just using the source pre-trained model.In particular, the two novel auxiliary tasks proposed are:1) Group contrastive learning to discriminate between low and high quality images in a test batch. 2) Rank ordering between two distorted versions of a test image to maintain relative quality relationships.The overall hypothesis is that optimizing a combination of these two losses that capture quality-relevant information can enable effective test time adaptation for blind IQA without requiring access to the original training data. The experiments aim to validate if the proposed approach can improve multiple pre-trained IQA models on unseen test datasets compared to the source models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing test time adaptation techniques for blind image quality assessment (IQA) models to mitigate distribution shifts between training and test data. 2. Formulating two novel self-supervised auxiliary tasks to enable test time adaptation in IQA:- Group contrastive (GC) loss that contrasts groups of low and high quality images in a batch to capture quality discriminative information.- Rank loss that maintains the quality order between two different distorted versions of the same image.3. Demonstrating that the proposed TTA method can significantly improve the performance of four different quality-aware source models on four different test IQA databases. Even using a small batch of test images helps achieve noticeable gains.4. The two losses are complementary - GC loss works better when quality separation in a batch is high, while rank loss works better when batch quality is similar. Their combination handles diverse scenarios.5. Showing the importance of quality-aware losses for IQA model adaptation, as compared to a generic rotation prediction task.In summary, the main contribution appears to be in designing tailored auxiliary tasks using rank and contrastive losses to enable test time adaptation for blind IQA models, without requiring the original training data. The approach is shown to work across diverse IQA models and test databases.
