# [Deep Learning-based Embedded Intrusion Detection System for Automotive   CAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10674)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Vehicles are becoming more connected and automated, but legacy in-vehicle networks like CAN lack built-in security, allowing attackers to observe, tamper with, and modify critical information.
- Various intrusion detection approaches have been proposed to detect such threats, with machine learning models proving highly effective. However, deploying ML models requires high compute power to perform detection at line rate. Dedicated ML accelerator ECUs have high power consumption and complexity.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a hybrid FPGA-based ECU architecture with a dedicated hardware accelerator that implements a deep CNN intrusion detection model. 
- The accelerator is an off-the-shelf Xilinx Deep Learning Processor (DPU) IP core, tightly coupled to the ECU via AXI interface and controlled via software APIs.
- A quantized CNN model takes sequences of CAN IDs as input and classifies messages as normal or attack. Model is trained on open dataset with DoS, fuzzing, spoofing attacks.

Contributions:
- Achieves 99.32% detection accuracy on average, identical to state-of-the-art GPU implementations, with 0.64% false positive rate.
- Reduces per-message latency by 51.8% compared to GPU implementation.
- Consumes 94% less power than GPU implementation.
- Enables transparent integration of ML IDS functionality into ECU with minimal effort compared to dedicated IDS ECU or loose GPU accelerator.
- Shows higher performance and lower overhead compared to other literature techniques.
- Establishes pathway for line-rate distributed IDS for CAN and Automotive Ethernet.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an efficient tight coupling of ML acceleration into ECU architecture via hybrid FPGA, enabling real-time intrusion detection on CAN with high accuracy and low overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an intrusion detection system architecture integrated on an FPGA-based electronic control unit to accurately detect malicious activity on automotive CAN networks with low latency and power consumption through dedicated quantized deep learning hardware acceleration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hybrid FPGA-based ECU architecture with a tightly coupled deep learning accelerator that can perform real-time intrusion detection on Controller Area Network (CAN) with high accuracy and low latency while consuming much less power compared to GPU-based implementations. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) An ECU architecture using Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ FPGA with a dedicated deep learning processing unit (DPU) accelerator integrated tightly into the programmable logic. This allows offloading the intrusion detection tasks from the main application processor to the low-power DPU accelerator.

2) A quantized deep convolutional neural network (QdCNN) intrusion detection model implemented on the DPU accelerator. It achieves 99.32% detection accuracy on average while consuming only 5.76W power.

3) Significant improvements in latency and power consumption over GPU-based implementations - 51.8% lower latency per CAN message and 94% lower power than GPU version.

4) Analysis of different DPU configurations showing the tradeoffs between performance, resource utilization and power. The B1152 DPU offers the best balance.

In summary, the paper demonstrates an efficient real-time intrusion detection solution for automotive CAN networks with tight integration of a specialized ML accelerator into the ECU architecture.
