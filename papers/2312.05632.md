# [Subject-Based Domain Adaptation for Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05632)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Facial expression recognition (FER) models need to be adapted to individual subjects due to high variability in facial expressions across people. 
- Standard unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods use a single labeled source dataset and adapt to an unlabeled target dataset. But a single source does not capture inter-personal variability well.
- Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) can leverage multiple labeled source datasets but existing methods don't scale well to a large number of source domains.

Proposed Solution:
- Treat each subject as a separate domain and perform subject-based MSDA using multiple labeled source subjects and an unlabeled target subject.
- Align representations across source subjects using a classification loss and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss.
- Generate high-quality pseudo-labels for target subject using an Augmented Confident Pseudo Label (ACPL) strategy based on augmentation and thresholding.
- Jointly optimize target adaptation on confident target samples and labeled source samples using classification and MMD losses.

Main Contributions:
- First subject-based MSDA method that scales to a large number of source domains by treating each subject as a domain.
- Novel ACPL strategy to generate highly reliable pseudo-labels for target adaptation.
- Experiments on BioVid dataset with 87 subjects show improved performance over state-of-the-art MSDA methods.
- Analysis shows increasing source subjects improves adaptation and the method scales well computationally.

In summary, the key idea is to leverage multiple source subjects to capture inter-personal variability better when adapting FER models to new target subjects in an unsupervised manner. The proposed subject-based MSDA method outperforms prior arts on this problem.
