# [Enhancing Dimension-Reduced Scatter Plots with Class and Feature   Centroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Dimension reduction is increasingly used to simplify high-dimensional datasets, especially in genomics and biomedicine. A key challenge is interpreting the resulting 2D scatter plots, as the x- and y-axes have arbitrary units and do not directly relate to the original features. This makes it difficult to understand what the plots represent. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose enhancing 2D scatter plots from dimension reduction by overlaying class centroids and feature centroids. The class centroids represent the average x,y position of all points belonging to a class. The feature centroids represent the average x,y position of all points having a specific feature. This connects the 2D space back to the original high-dimensional feature space.

Data:
The method is demonstrated on 235 variants of 3 neurogenetic diseases - hereditary spastic paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The raw data had 970 phenotype features from the Human Phenotype Ontology. This was reduced to 31 features using hierarchical subsumption. t-SNE was used for dimension reduction to 2D.

Results:
Class and feature centroids were calculated and overlaid on the 2D scatter plots. Plots with centroids enabled improved interpretation compared to plots without. For example, diseases clustered nearer to their characteristic phenotype features, like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and muscle weakness.  

Main Contributions:
- A new method to calculate and visualize class and feature centroids on 2D scatter plots from dimension reduction.
- Demonstration of feasibility on a real-world biomedical dataset. 
- Improved interpretability of dimension-reduced scatter plots by connecting the 2D space back to original high-dimensional features.

The central insight is that the 2D embedding contains enough information to estimate centroids for classes and features from the original space. Adding these centroids to the plots aids understanding substantially.
