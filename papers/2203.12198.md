# [Deep Frequency Filtering for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12198)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called Deep Frequency Filtering (DFF) for improving domain generalization in deep neural networks. The key idea is to modulate different frequency components in the feature maps of a network during training in order to enhance components that transfer well across domains and suppress components that do not generalize well. 

The central hypothesis is that different frequency components in the features have different degrees of transferability across domains. Specifically, prior work has shown that DNNs tend to prioritize lower frequencies during training, and that higher frequencies may hurt generalization. Based on this, the authors hypothesize that explicitly filtering the feature maps in the frequency domain can improve model generalization.

So in summary, the main research question is: Can modulating frequency components in the latent feature space of a network during training lead to better generalization on new domains? The authors propose DFF as a way to test this hypothesis.
