# [RL4F: Generating Natural Language Feedback with Reinforcement Learning   for Repairing Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question of this paper seems to be:

How can we train a small critique generator model to provide useful natural language feedback to improve the performance of a large, fixed language model on downstream tasks, without needing to fine-tune the large model?

In particular, the paper proposes a reinforcement learning based approach called RL4F to train the critique generator model to maximize the performance of the large language model GPT-3 on various tasks like summarization and action planning. 

The key ideas are:

- Using a multi-agent collaborative framework with separate critique generator and task models, where the task model (GPT-3) is fixed. This allows applying the method to large pre-trained LMs without modifying them.

- Training the critique generator via policy gradient to directly optimize for improving the task model's end performance on downstream datasets, rather than just trying to mimic human annotations.

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of this RL-trained critic model in providing useful feedback to GPT-3 on multiple text generation tasks, improving over supervised and retrieval based critics.

So in summary, the main research question is how to learn a personalized critic that provides useful feedback tailored to a task model, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself. The proposed RL4F method aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-agent collaborative framework called RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback) for generating natural language critiques to improve a language model's outputs. The key ideas are:

- RL4F involves two language models - a critique generator (\critic) and a task model (\task). The goal is to train \critic to provide critiques that will steer \task to generating better outputs on a downstream task (e.g. summarization), without modifying \task. 

- \critic is trained via a combination of supervised learning on human critiques, followed by reinforcement learning to directly optimize the critiques for improving \task's performance on the end task. 

- Experiments on summarization, action planning, and alphabetization tasks show RL4F can improve \task's (GPT-3) performance by providing useful critiques. Improvements are shown over supervised training of \critic and other baselines.

- The method allows improving a large, fixed LM like GPT-3 without fine-tuning its parameters. This is advantageous when \task is inaccessible for full training.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting RL4F, a reinforced critic generator, to provide natural language feedback that improves a task model's predictions without modifying the task model itself. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes RL4F, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for training a critique generator model to provide useful natural language feedback that improves the performance of a fixed downstream task model like GPT-3, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel framework for training a language model to generate natural language critiques that help improve another "task" language model's performance, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself. The key innovations are:

1. Using a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to directly optimize the critique generator to improve the task model's performance on a downstream task, rather than just training it in a supervised way. 

2. Treating the task model as fixed and inaccessible, rather than requiring joint training or fine-tuning access. This is important for practical applications involving large pre-trained LMs like GPT-3.

3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach on three diverse tasks - summarization, action planning, and alphabetization.

The most related prior work focused on generating critiques via supervised learning alone [1,2], retrieving human critiques [3], or required fine-tuning access to the task model itself [4]. Unlike these approaches, this paper's method allows optimizing a critique generator for a fixed, black-box task model like GPT-3.

The use of reinforcement learning to optimize discrete outputs like text for a downstream objective is also an active area of research [5,6]. This paper contributes a new application of these RL techniques for the problem of conditional text generation.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on the very challenging problem of how to provide useful natural language feedback to improve large, inaccessible language models. The results demonstrate substantial gains over supervised and retrieved methods on all three tasks.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing techniques to prevent semantic drift in RL4F, such as adding explicit constraints during training to maintain interpretability and fluency of generated critiques. The authors note that while they did not observe significant semantic drift in their experiments, future work should study this in more depth.

- Exploring different ensemble approaches for critique generation, such as combining critiques from multiple experts including humans and other machine agents. The current work focused on a single critique generator model, but using a diverse ensemble could improve performance.

- Generalizing the approach to other types of natural language feedback beyond critiques, such as direct textual refinements. The authors focused specifically on critiques, but the framework could potentially be extended to other forms of feedback.

- Incorporating new critiques into the framework when they become available, rather than treating the task model as completely fixed. The current approach does not have an explicit mechanism for incorporating new feedback.

- Comparing and combining the approach with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like adapters. The authors suggest RL4F could be seen as an alternative to adapter-based fine-tuning when model access is limited.

- Evaluating the approach on a broader range of datasets and tasks beyond the three studied here. The authors acknowledge their analysis was limited to certain domains.

- Further analyzing the scaling properties and iterative application of the method on very large models. The experiments focused on smaller models, so scaling laws remain to be fully characterized.

- Studying the sample efficiency and generalization of the learned critiques compared to supervised approaches. The authors did not explicitly focus on these aspects.

Overall, the main themes seem to be better understanding semantic drift, generalizing across feedback types and tasks, scaling to larger models, and improving sample efficiency - while also combining RL4F with other techniques like adapters or ensembles. Evaluating on more tasks and domains is needed too. But the core framework provides a good foundation to build on.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback), a multi-agent collaborative framework where one language model generates critiques to help improve another language model's outputs. RL4F involves a task model that performs a task like summarization, and a critique model that provides feedback on the task model's outputs. The critique model is trained via reinforcement learning to generate critiques that maximize the task model's end performance, without changing the task model itself. This allows improving a large, fixed model like GPT-3 using a smaller, trainable critique generator. The authors evaluate RL4F on summarization, action planning, and alphabetization tasks. RL4F critiques yield relative gains of up to 10% over supervised learning, retrieval, and prompting baselines in steering the task model to better outputs. The framework demonstrates promising scaling properties and remains useful when applied iteratively. Overall, RL4F presents a method for a small model to improve a large, inaccessible model without retraining the latter.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-agent collaborative framework called RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback) for generating natural language critiques to improve language model outputs. The framework involves two language models - a task model that makes predictions for a given input, and a critique model that provides feedback on the task model's outputs. The critique model is trained via reinforcement learning to maximize the end-task performance of the (fixed) task model. 

The method is evaluated on three datasets - topic-based summarization, action planning, and alphabetization. Compared to supervised learning and retrieval-based baselines, RL4F achieves superior performance in steering the task model to improve its predictions across metrics like ROUGE, BLEURT and exact match accuracy. The framework presents several advantages in the era of large language models, allowing critique generation without retraining or fine-tuning the task model. Experiments demonstrate promising scaling behavior and gains from iterative application. The work helps advance the broader goal of enabling language models to learn from critiques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in the paper "RL4F: Generating Natural Language Feedback with Reinforcement Learning for Repairing Model Outputs" is a multi-agent collaborative framework involving two language models:

The paper introduces RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback), which consists of a critique generator model (\critic) that is trained to provide critiques to improve the outputs of a task model (\task). The goal is for \critic to generate useful critiques that can steer \task to revise its potentially erroneous initial predictions and produce better outputs. 

Unlike prior work that trains \task to utilize critiques, RL4F keeps \task's parameters fixed and only trains \critic. This allows RL4F to work with large, inaccessible models like GPT-3 for \task. 

RL4F first trains \critic in a supervised manner on human-written critiques. It then further trains \critic via reinforcement learning to maximize the end-task performance of \task. Specifically, it uses policy gradient with a reward based on the similarity of \task's revised output to the ground truth targets.

By training only the small critique generator \critic, RL4F is able to improve the task performance of large, fixed \task models like GPT-3 without modifying them. Experiments on summarization, planning, and alphabetization tasks show improvements over baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a multi-agent collaborative framework involving two language models, where one model (the critique generator) is trained to improve the performance of the other model (the task model). The key research question seems to be whether the task of critiquing language model predictions can be effectively passed to an external agent, while keeping the language model itself intact. Specifically, the paper investigates whether a reinforcement learning approach called RL4F can be used to train a critique generator model to provide useful critiques that help the task model (GPT-3) improve its outputs, without needing to fine-tune or modify GPT-3 itself. The goal is to show that the critique generator can learn to provide tailored feedback that boosts the task model's performance on downstream tasks like summarization and action planning, even though the task model is treated as a fixed black-box module.
