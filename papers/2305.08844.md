# [RL4F: Generating Natural Language Feedback with Reinforcement Learning   for Repairing Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question of this paper seems to be:How can we train a small critique generator model to provide useful natural language feedback to improve the performance of a large, fixed language model on downstream tasks, without needing to fine-tune the large model?In particular, the paper proposes a reinforcement learning based approach called RL4F to train the critique generator model to maximize the performance of the large language model GPT-3 on various tasks like summarization and action planning. The key ideas are:- Using a multi-agent collaborative framework with separate critique generator and task models, where the task model (GPT-3) is fixed. This allows applying the method to large pre-trained LMs without modifying them.- Training the critique generator via policy gradient to directly optimize for improving the task model's end performance on downstream datasets, rather than just trying to mimic human annotations.- Demonstrating the effectiveness of this RL-trained critic model in providing useful feedback to GPT-3 on multiple text generation tasks, improving over supervised and retrieval based critics.So in summary, the main research question is how to learn a personalized critic that provides useful feedback tailored to a task model, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself. The proposed RL4F method aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-agent collaborative framework called RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback) for generating natural language critiques to improve a language model's outputs. The key ideas are:- RL4F involves two language models - a critique generator (\critic) and a task model (\task). The goal is to train \critic to provide critiques that will steer \task to generating better outputs on a downstream task (e.g. summarization), without modifying \task. - \critic is trained via a combination of supervised learning on human critiques, followed by reinforcement learning to directly optimize the critiques for improving \task's performance on the end task. - Experiments on summarization, action planning, and alphabetization tasks show RL4F can improve \task's (GPT-3) performance by providing useful critiques. Improvements are shown over supervised training of \critic and other baselines.- The method allows improving a large, fixed LM like GPT-3 without fine-tuning its parameters. This is advantageous when \task is inaccessible for full training.In summary, the key contribution is presenting RL4F, a reinforced critic generator, to provide natural language feedback that improves a task model's predictions without modifying the task model itself. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes RL4F, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for training a critique generator model to provide useful natural language feedback that improves the performance of a fixed downstream task model like GPT-3, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel framework for training a language model to generate natural language critiques that help improve another "task" language model's performance, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself. The key innovations are:1. Using a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to directly optimize the critique generator to improve the task model's performance on a downstream task, rather than just training it in a supervised way. 2. Treating the task model as fixed and inaccessible, rather than requiring joint training or fine-tuning access. This is important for practical applications involving large pre-trained LMs like GPT-3.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach on three diverse tasks - summarization, action planning, and alphabetization.The most related prior work focused on generating critiques via supervised learning alone [1,2], retrieving human critiques [3], or required fine-tuning access to the task model itself [4]. Unlike these approaches, this paper's method allows optimizing a critique generator for a fixed, black-box task model like GPT-3.The use of reinforcement learning to optimize discrete outputs like text for a downstream objective is also an active area of research [5,6]. This paper contributes a new application of these RL techniques for the problem of conditional text generation.Overall, this paper makes excellent progress on the very challenging problem of how to provide useful natural language feedback to improve large, inaccessible language models. The results demonstrate substantial gains over supervised and retrieved methods on all three tasks.References:[1] Saunders et al. 2022 [2] Schick & Schütze 2022[3] Madaan et al. 2022[4] Scheurer & Schütze 2022[5] Stiennon et al. 2020[6] Tian et al. 2022
