# [RL4F: Generating Natural Language Feedback with Reinforcement Learning   for Repairing Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question of this paper seems to be:How can we train a small critique generator model to provide useful natural language feedback to improve the performance of a large, fixed language model on downstream tasks, without needing to fine-tune the large model?In particular, the paper proposes a reinforcement learning based approach called RL4F to train the critique generator model to maximize the performance of the large language model GPT-3 on various tasks like summarization and action planning. The key ideas are:- Using a multi-agent collaborative framework with separate critique generator and task models, where the task model (GPT-3) is fixed. This allows applying the method to large pre-trained LMs without modifying them.- Training the critique generator via policy gradient to directly optimize for improving the task model's end performance on downstream datasets, rather than just trying to mimic human annotations.- Demonstrating the effectiveness of this RL-trained critic model in providing useful feedback to GPT-3 on multiple text generation tasks, improving over supervised and retrieval based critics.So in summary, the main research question is how to learn a personalized critic that provides useful feedback tailored to a task model, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself. The proposed RL4F method aims to address this question.
