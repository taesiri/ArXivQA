# [RL4F: Generating Natural Language Feedback with Reinforcement Learning   for Repairing Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question of this paper seems to be:How can we train a small critique generator model to provide useful natural language feedback to improve the performance of a large, fixed language model on downstream tasks, without needing to fine-tune the large model?In particular, the paper proposes a reinforcement learning based approach called RL4F to train the critique generator model to maximize the performance of the large language model GPT-3 on various tasks like summarization and action planning. The key ideas are:- Using a multi-agent collaborative framework with separate critique generator and task models, where the task model (GPT-3) is fixed. This allows applying the method to large pre-trained LMs without modifying them.- Training the critique generator via policy gradient to directly optimize for improving the task model's end performance on downstream datasets, rather than just trying to mimic human annotations.- Demonstrating the effectiveness of this RL-trained critic model in providing useful feedback to GPT-3 on multiple text generation tasks, improving over supervised and retrieval based critics.So in summary, the main research question is how to learn a personalized critic that provides useful feedback tailored to a task model, without needing to fine-tune the task model itself. The proposed RL4F method aims to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-agent collaborative framework called RL4F (Reinforcement Learning for Feedback) for generating natural language critiques to improve a language model's outputs. The key ideas are:- RL4F involves two language models - a critique generator (\critic) and a task model (\task). The goal is to train \critic to provide critiques that will steer \task to generating better outputs on a downstream task (e.g. summarization), without modifying \task. - \critic is trained via a combination of supervised learning on human critiques, followed by reinforcement learning to directly optimize the critiques for improving \task's performance on the end task. - Experiments on summarization, action planning, and alphabetization tasks show RL4F can improve \task's (GPT-3) performance by providing useful critiques. Improvements are shown over supervised training of \critic and other baselines.- The method allows improving a large, fixed LM like GPT-3 without fine-tuning its parameters. This is advantageous when \task is inaccessible for full training.In summary, the key contribution is presenting RL4F, a reinforced critic generator, to provide natural language feedback that improves a task model's predictions without modifying the task model itself. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.
