# [Cross Domain Policy Transfer with Effect Cycle-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training robotic policies from scratch using reinforcement learning is very sample inefficient. Transferring policies from source domains to target domains with different state/action spaces is an attractive approach to solve this.
- Prior work has limitations in needing paired data, hand-designed features, or suffers from compounding errors over time.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a framework to learn mapping functions between different domains using unpaired data.
- Introduce "effect cycle consistency" loss that aligns the effects of transitions across domains rather than states directly. This mitigates compounding errors.
- Use a symmetrical optimization structure that trains mapping functions bidirectionally between domains.

Key Contributions:
- Effect cycle consistency loss that aligns transition effects across domains to learn mappings. Reduces compounding errors.
- Symmetrical optimization structure for training mapping functions bidirectionally.
- State-of-the-art performance on 3 locomotion and 2 robotic arm tasks. Reduces alignment errors and achieves better performance than baseline methods.
- Framework enables transferring policies to new domains using only unpaired data, without needing expensive paired trajectories.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel unpaired learning framework for transferring policies across domains with different state/action spaces. The key ideas are the effect cycle consistency loss and symmetrical optimization of mapping functions. Experiments demonstrate improved alignment and performance over baselines. The framework has useful applications for overcoming sample inefficiency in reinforcement learning.
