# [Zero-shot Generation of Coherent Storybook from Plain Text Story using   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03900)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate a coherent storybook with a consistent main character appearance from plain text stories in a zero-shot manner using large language models and diffusion models?The key hypotheses are:1) Large language models can effectively generate prompts from plain text stories that capture the context and semantics for generating matched images. 2) A combination of textual inversion and iterative latent diffusion can inject a target identity into the facial regions of images in a coherent manner while preserving background details.3) This approach can allow zero-shot generation of coherent storybooks with a consistent main character without requiring additional training data.So in summary, the central research question is around zero-shot coherent storybook generation using LLMs and diffusion models, and the key hypotheses focus on prompt generation, identity injection, and training-free coherence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. A novel prompt generation pipeline that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate prompts from plain text stories, replacing the need for human-crafted prompts. 2. A proposed semantic image editing method called "Iterative Coherent Identity Injection" that injects a target identity into facial regions while preserving background regions across multiple images. This allows maintaining character coherence in generated storybooks.3. The proposed method allows zero-shot generation of coherent storybooks from plain text stories using only pre-trained models, without requiring additional training data. 4. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art semantic image editing baselines in aspects like coherence preservation and background region preservation.5. The method provides fine-grained control over the degree of semantic editing by adjusting number of cycles in the Iterative Coherent Identity Injection process.In summary, the key contribution is a training-free framework for generating coherent storybooks from plain text stories by combining prompt engineering techniques and a novel semantic editing method to maintain character identity across generated images. The zero-shot capability using only pre-trained models is a significant advantage over prior story synthesis methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel neural pipeline for zero-shot generation of coherent storybooks from plain text stories using large language models for prompt engineering and latent diffusion models for semantic image editing while maintaining character identity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of AI-generated storybooks:- This paper presents a novel method for zero-shot generation of coherent storybooks using plain text stories as input. Compared to prior work like StoryGAN and StoryDALL-E that require training on image-caption datasets, this method does not need any additional training data. This is a key advantage.- The use of LLMs for automatic prompt generation is an interesting approach not seen in prior story synthesis works. It removes the need for manual prompt engineering. The prompt generation pipeline using summarization and style transfer capabilities of LLMs is clever.- The proposed iterative identity injection technique guided by textual embeddings and face detection allows maintaining character coherence across a generated storybook. This sets it apart from prior single image generation methods. Maintaining identity coherence is critical for storytelling applications but not addressed well before.- Both text-to-image models like CLIP-guided diffusion and image-to-image models like Blended Latent Diffusion have been explored for image editing tasks before. But using them effectively for the new application of coherent storybook generation with a character identity constraint is novel.- The experiments comprehensively evaluate the method on diverse stories and compare against several state-of-the-art baselines using both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.- One limitation is the use of a pre-trained model like Stable Diffusion that can sometimes generate artifacts. Training a custom text-to-image model with better coherence preservation could be future work. But overall, this paper presents a novel application of LLMs and diffusion models for coherent story generation without needing additional training data.In summary, the zero-shot generation, automatic prompt engineering, identity-preserving editing, and quantitative experiments make this work a solid contribution over prior arts in story synthesis and text-to-image generation. The proposed techniques are generalizable to other narrative generation tasks as well.
