# [Nonlinear In-situ Calibration of Strain-Gauge Force/Torque Sensors for   Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09846)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate force/torque (F/T) sensor calibration is crucial for humanoid robots to achieve successful force estimation and control. 
- Commonly used affine calibration models do not fully capture nonlinear characteristics of strain gauge sensors. This results in inaccurate measurements when forces/torques applied are much higher than during calibration, such as when estimating thrust of jet-powered humanoid robots.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop and validate nonlinear polynomial models for F/T sensor calibration, with increasing number of coefficients to minimize residuals.
- Test models on data collected from experiments with iCub3 robot, analyzing improvement in force/torque estimation error.
- Use LASSO regression to enforce sparsity and reduce model complexity for high degree polynomials.

Experiments:
- Performed in-situ calibration of F/T sensor on iCub3's arm using custom trajectories and loads up to 10kg.
- Vary configurations to cover wide range of forces, torques and temperatures.
- Compare 1st to 5th degree polynomial models and study effect of regularization.

Key Results:
- 4th degree polynomial model reduced RMSE from 4.58N to 2.28N compared to affine model. 
- Absolute error reduced from 16N to below 6N with 4th degree model.
- LASSO regularization further improved RMSE to 1.6N by enforcing sparsity.
- Higher degree polynomials capture sensor nonlinearities better.
- Tradeoff between model accuracy and complexity.

Main Contributions:
- Proposed and validated nonlinear polynomial models for improved F/T sensor calibration.
- Studied optimal model complexity using regularization. 
- Demonstrated significant error reduction on real robot.
- Framework to test different calibration models.

The summary covers the key aspects of the problem, proposed approach, experiments and results in a concise yet detailed manner for clear understanding. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
