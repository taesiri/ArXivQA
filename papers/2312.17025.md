# [Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17025)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Experiential Co-Learning of Software-Developing Agents":

Problem:
- Recent advances in autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have enabled them to collaborate effectively to solve complex tasks. However, these agents often tackle tasks in isolation without benefiting from past experiences, leading to repetitive mistakes and inefficient trials. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Experiential Co-Learning", a novel framework where instructor and assistant agents gather shortcut-oriented experiences from historical trajectories and leverage these past experiences for mutual reasoning to more effectively address unseen tasks.

Key Components:
- Co-tracking: Promotes joint exploration between agents to create procedural trajectories for training tasks, showing clear collaborative strategies.
- Co-memorizing: Strategically extracts "shortcuts" from trajectories using environment feedback, preserving them in collective experience pools. 
- Co-reasoning: Agents enhance instructions and responses by utilizing their collective experience pools when facing unseen tasks.

Main Contributions:
- First to integrate past experiences into the collaboration of LLM-powered agents for efficient handling of software development.
- Suggests constructing execution graphs to document "shortcuts" as experiences to motivate shortcut thinking during agent interactions. 
- Extensive experiments validate the enhanced autonomy and efficiency of agents' collaborative behavior in software development tasks.
