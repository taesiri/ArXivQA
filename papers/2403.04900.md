# [Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated   Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of designing tracking controllers for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on manifolds. Specifically, it considers the challenge of asymptotically driving the system's state towards a reference trajectory on the manifold. This is an important problem in robotics and aerospace applications. 

Prior methods for solving this problem rely on having a Lie group structure on the configuration manifold, which enables formulating an intrinsic state-valued tracking error. However, many important manifolds like spheres lack this group structure. Other methods only ensure local convergence or converge from a smaller region of the state space.

Proposed Solution:
The key insight is that the transitive action of a Lie group G on the configuration manifold Q (even when Q itself lacks a group structure) enables defining an intrinsic tracking error on the state space. Specifically, a lift of the reference trajectory to G allows transforming the actual and desired configurations into a single manifold G, on which their difference is computed to obtain the configuration error in Q. Taking the derivative yields the state tracking error. 

This geometric error then facilitates formulating the tracking problem as an error regulation problem, allowing the injection of potential and dissipation forces using feedforward terms. Under mild assumptions, this results in a smooth control policy that achieves almost global asymptotic tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems on any homogeneous Riemannian manifold Q.

Contributions:
- A systematic way to formulate tracking control for fully-actuated mechanical systems on a broad class of manifolds as error regulation
- A control policy that guarantees almost global asymptotic tracking for such systems
- Special cases that simplify the control policy for spheres and Lie groups
- Demonstrated applications to an axisymmetric satellite and aerial robot system

In summary, the paper proposes a unified approach for tracking control of fully-actuated mechanical systems on homogeneous spaces like spheres, Lie groups etc. with formal convergence guarantees. The key insight is using the group action's transitivity to define an intrinsic geometric error.
