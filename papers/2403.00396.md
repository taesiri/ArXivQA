# [GLFNET: Global-Local (frequency) Filter Networks for efficient medical   image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00396)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Transformers have achieved high performance on computer vision tasks, but suffer from high complexity and data inefficiency, limiting their use for medical image segmentation tasks. 
- Existing Transformers for medical segmentation lack inductive bias to learn efficiently from small medical imaging datasets.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose Global-Local Filter Networks (GLFNet), which replace the self-attention mechanism in Transformers with a combination of global and local filters operating in the frequency domain to improve efficiency and data efficiency.

- Global filters learn from the whole feature map after converting to the frequency domain. Local filters are learned from $4\times4$ patches from the feature map to capture local context. 

- Combining information from global and local filters in both spatial and frequency domains creates an efficient model while introducing inductive bias for improved generalization.

Contributions:
- A novel transformer-style block specifically designed for medical image segmentation, replacing self-attention with frequency domain filters that fuse global and local information.

- The proposed GLFNet architecture built using these blocks achieves state-of-the-art performance across 3 medical image datasets (ACDC, Synapse, BraTS19) while being twice as efficient as prior state-of-the-art in terms of GFLOPs.

- Demonstrates the ability to handle both single and multi-modal medical images without architectural changes.

- Reduces complexity from quadratic to log-linear for transformer-style models without losing segmentation accuracy.
