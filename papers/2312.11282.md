# [LLM-ARK: Knowledge Graph Reasoning Using Large Language Models via Deep   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show promising reasoning capabilities but still fall short on knowledge graph (KG) reasoning tasks compared to smaller models. 
- Two main challenges of applying LLM-based agents: 1) Limited perception of reasoning environments/lack of grounding limits competence. 2) Lack of mechanisms to optimize intermediate reasoning processes in multi-hop tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce LLM-ARK - a framework that uses LLMs as agents to perform reasoning on KGs via reinforcement learning.
- Employs a Full Textual Environment (FTE) prompt to provide complete state information to the LLM at each step.
- Reframes KG multi-hop inference as a sequential decision making problem and uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the model.
- Only updates parameters of addon actors, keeps LLM itself frozen. Enables learning from diverse reward signals.

Main Contributions:
- Assesses capabilities of GPT-4 on KG reasoning tasks and analyzes limitations.
- Proposes LLM-ARK which expresses KG reasoning as an RL problem and leverages FTE prompts plus PPO to optimize LLM agent's policies.
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on OpenDialKG dataset, significantly outperforming GPT-4 and prior methods. Demonstrates efficacy of grounding LLMs and using RL with policy optimization.

In summary, the paper tackles challenges in applying LLMs to KG reasoning by proposing an RL-based framework using FTE prompts and policy optimization to deliver precise and adaptable predictions that surpass previous approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces LLM-ARK, a framework that leverages large language models as agents to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs via deep reinforcement learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors assess the capabilities of state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) GPT-4 on large-scale knowledge graph (KG) inference datasets and analyze the results to understand why the performance is inferior compared to smaller models. 

2. The authors introduce LLM-ARK, a framework that leverages LLMs as agents to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs. It formulates the KG inference task as a reinforcement learning sequential decision making problem and uses a full textual environment prompt to aggregate multi-scale inputs.

3. LLM-ARK only updates the parameters of the actor networks using policy gradient, without accessing the LLM parameters or propagating gradients through the LLM. This allows learning from diverse reward signals during environment interactions.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing LLM-ARK to improve LLM's reasoning capability on knowledge graphs by expressing it as a reinforcement learning problem and using specialized prompts and reward functions. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the OpenDialKG benchmark dataset.
