# [Large Language Model-based Human-Agent Collaboration for Complex Task   Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12914)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in understanding, reasoning and planning. This has led to the development of LLM-based autonomous agents to assist humans in solving complex tasks.
- However, current LLM agents still have limitations in fully grasping human needs and adjusting to dynamic environments. This poses challenges in deploying them in real-world applications requiring high accuracy.
- The paper introduces the problem of LLM-based human-agent collaboration to combine human and machine intelligence for effectively solving complex tasks. The key challenge is determining optimal stages for human intervention to enhance efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ReHAC, a reinforcement learning-based human-agent collaboration approach to identify advantageous moments for human input. 
- ReHAC formulates a Markov decision process with states, actions, rewards and policies. The key is a collaboration policy model to decide agent or human action based on state.
- The reward function balances task performance and human intervention cost. ReHAC is trained to maximize expected reward.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the problem of LLM-based human-agent collaboration for complex task solving.
- Proposes ReHAC, a novel reinforcement learning based method to dynamically introduce human interventions.
- Constructs a dataset of human-agent collaborative task solving for model training.
- Experiments show ReHAC effectively balances efficiency and performance by identifying optimal human intervention points.
- The work lays the groundwork for exploring synergistic human-agent collaboration.

In summary, the paper tackles the limitations of standalone LLM agents in complex real-world tasks through a novel human-agent collaboration approach called ReHAC. By enabling dynamic and minimal human interventions, ReHAC aims to combine complementary strengths of humans and LLM agents.
