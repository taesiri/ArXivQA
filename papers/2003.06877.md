# Guidance and Evaluation: Semantic-Aware Image Inpainting for Mixed   Scenes

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can semantic segmentation be effectively utilized to guide image inpainting for completing missing regions in mixed scenes with multiple semantic objects?The key points are:- Conventional image inpainting methods struggle with mixed scenes as they cannot properly model the different texture distributions of various semantics. - Structural information like edges can help but often fail to capture semantics. Using semantic segmentation maps can provide useful semantic guidance but unreliable segmentation of missing regions is a challenge.- The paper proposes an iterative interplay between semantic segmentation and image inpainting in a coarse-to-fine manner to progressively refine the segmentation map and inpainting result.- A segmentation confidence evaluation mechanism is introduced to identify unreliable regions and correct them in later stages. - Experiments show the proposed method generates more accurate semantics and realistic textures compared to prior arts, especially for complex mixed scenes.In summary, the core research question is how semantic segmentation can be reliably obtained from corrupted images to guide effective image inpainting of mixed scenes. The paper proposes an iterative joint optimization approach to address this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing an interplay framework between semantic segmentation and image inpainting in a coarse-to-fine manner to improve the reliability of the semantic segmentation guidance for image inpainting. This is done through a Semantic Guidance and Evaluation Network (SGE-Net).2. Introducing a segmentation confidence evaluation module (SCEM) that provides self-evaluation of inpainted regions by scoring the segmentation confidence. This allows the model to identify ambiguously inpainted pixels and refine them in subsequent scales. 3. Demonstrating that the proposed SGE-Net outperforms existing methods, especially on mixed scenes with multiple semantics, in generating semantically realistic contexts and visually pleasing textures. Experiments on real-world images of mixed scenes show the effectiveness.In summary, the key contribution is developing an interplay framework between semantic segmentation and image inpainting to iteratively refine the semantic guidance, along with a segmentation confidence scoring module for self-evaluation. This allows high-quality inpainting of mixed scenes with improved semantic content.
