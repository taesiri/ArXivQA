# [Federated Learning for distribution skewed data using sample weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning approach that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local private data. One major challenge in FL is that client data is often non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), meaning data distributions across clients can differ significantly from the global distribution. This causes poor model performance. Existing methods addressing this issue have limitations - they either require sharing some private data, do not fully address feature distribution skewness within a client, or have high communication costs.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FedDisk, a federated learning method to alleviate negative impacts of non-IID data distributions across clients. The key idea is to assign sample weights to each client's data to adjust their distributions closer to the global distribution during training. This is achieved in two phases - (1) Density estimation to compute sample weights; (2) Weighted federated learning for the main task. 

In phase 1, each client trains a local density model, and all clients jointly train a global density model using federated learning, without exposing private data. These models estimate density ratios between local and global distributions, which become sample weights. In phase 2, standard federated averaging is performed, but with the computed sample weights applied to client model updates.

Main Contributions:

1) Theoretically derives adjusting sample weights from empirical risk minimization to handle skewed distributions in federated learning.

2) Proposes FedDisk - a practical two-phase method to realize weighted federated learning without exposing private data, using only standard model exchanges.

3) Evaluates FedDisk on three real-world non-IID datasets, showing accuracy improvements of up to 22% and communication cost reduction by up to 8 times over state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

In summary, FedDisk provides an innovative way to address the long-standing challenge of non-IID data in federated learning, with demonstrated benefits across accuracy, efficiency and privacy preservation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning method called FedDisk that uses sample weights derived from density ratio estimation to adjust client distributions closer to the global distribution and mitigate negative impacts of non-IID data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Providing a theoretical base for skewed feature distribution data for federated learning by adjusting sample weights derived from the machine learning empirical risk.  

2. Providing a practical solution to mitigate the problem of learning from non-IID data for the FL framework without sharing clients' raw data. The proposed method only requires clients to share additional model parameters, similar to a typical federated learning framework.

3. Conducting several experiments on three datasets, including MNIST, non-IID benchmark dataset FEMNIST and real-world dataset Chest-Xray. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other experimental methods in classification accuracy and dramatically reduces communication costs.  

4. Providing a theoretical analysis to analyze the potential privacy leakage with the additional information exchanged in the proposed method. It is shown that the leakage information becomes insignificant when the number of clients increases.  

5. To the best knowledge of the authors, the proposed method is the first method utilizing data distribution information and sample weights to tackle the FL non-IID issue.

In summary, the main contribution is providing an effective federated learning solution for non-IID data that improves accuracy and reduces communication cost, while preserving privacy by only sharing model parameters instead of raw data.

The paper proposes a federated learning method called "FedDisk" to deal with the issue of skewed feature distributions across clients in federated learning. It uses sample weights derived from density ratio estimation to adjust the distributions closer to the global distribution. A neural network-based density estimation model called MADE is used to estimate densities while preserving privacy. The method is shown to improve accuracy and reduce communication costs for federated learning with non-IID data distributions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes adjusting the client distribution closer to the global distribution using sample weights. Can you explain in more detail how the sample weights are derived from the fundamental concept of empirical risk minimization? 

2. One of the main challenges is to obtain the global distribution information across clients without exposing their raw data. How does the proposed method address this challenge by leveraging the MADE models?

7. What are the implications of the increased model size for FedDisk in terms of storage requirements and suitability for different federated learning scenarios?

8. How does the privacy analysis argue that the information leakage from the additional MADE models becomes insignificant as the number of clients increases?

9. The experimental results show reduced communication costs for FedDisk. Can you explain why adjusting distributions with sample weights leads to faster convergence and reduced communication? 

10. How could fine-tuning the MADE model parameters or investigating different distribution models potentially improve outcomes for the proposed method in the future?
