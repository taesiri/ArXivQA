# [Dynamic Prompt Learning via Policy Gradient for Semi-structured   Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14610)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:

How can we develop an AI system that can dynamically learn to select good prompt examples for few-shot learning of large language models like GPT-3, in order to improve performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks involving both free text and tabular data?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new dataset called TabMWP for mathematical reasoning over free text and tabular data. This is more complex than existing math word problem datasets that use just free text.

- The GPT-3 model shows strong capability on TabMWP in a zero-shot setting, but its few-shot performance varies a lot based on the prompt examples selected. 

- To address this instability, the paper proposes a novel method called PromptPG that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically learn how to select good prompt examples for few-shot GPT-3 on a given test case.

- Experiments show PromptPG improves accuracy substantially over random prompt selection, resulting in new state-of-the-art performance on TabMWP.

So in summary, the key research question is how to develop a technique like PromptPG to dynamically select good prompt examples in order to unlock strong few-shot performance from large language models on complex mathematical reasoning tasks over heterogeneous data modalities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose TabMWP, a new large-scale dataset for math word problems that require reasoning over both textual and tabular data. TabMWP contains 38,431 problems aligned with tabular contexts, making it the first dataset of its kind. 

2. The authors evaluate strong baselines on TabMWP, including UnifiedQA, TAPEX, and GPT-3 models in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Experiments show the challenges of solving TabMWP compared to standard math word problem datasets that contain only text.

3. To address the instability issue of few-shot learning with GPT-3, the authors propose a novel method called PromptPG that utilizes policy gradient reinforcement learning to learn how to select good prompt examples for few-shot GPT-3 on TabMWP.

4. Experiments show PromptPG outperforms all baselines by a large margin on TabMWP. PromptPG reduces the variance of few-shot learning and achieves 68.23% accuracy, improving over few-shot GPT-3 by 5.31%.

 Based on my review of the paper, here is a one-sentence summary: 

The paper presents Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP), a new dataset of over 38,000 math word problems requiring reasoning over tabular data, and proposes PromptPG, a novel method that utilizes policy gradient to learn how to select effective examples for few-shot prompting of GPT-3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on TabMWP.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:

- This paper introduces a new dataset, TabMWP, for mathematical reasoning over tabular data. This is the first dataset focusing on math word problems with tabular contexts, filling an important gap compared to existing math word problem datasets that use only text. 

- The paper proposes a novel method, PromptPG, to learn good prompt examples for few-shot learning with GPT-3. This differs from prior work that uses random selection or similarity-based retrieval to select prompt examples. Using reinforcement learning to optimize prompt selection is a new technique in this space.

- Experiments show PromptPG outperforms existing methods like UnifiedQA and TAPEX by a large margin on TabMWP. This demonstrates the value of dynamic prompt learning, compared to just using a fixed pre-trained model.

- The TabMWP dataset requires reasoning over both text and tables, which is more challenging than text-only math word problems. This tests models' ability to integrate reasoning across modalities.

- The paper focuses on a semi-structured table representation. Other related work has looked at free-form tables or fully structured relational tables. This sits in the middle between unstructured and structured table representations.

- For evaluation, the paper uses accuracy on answer generation. Other related work has also reported things like reasoning step accuracy or logical form extraction.

Overall, the key novelties are the new tabular MWP dataset, the prompt learning method, and the experiments demonstrating strong performance on multi-modal reasoning compared to existing models/datasets. This nicely pushes forward the frontier in mathematical reasoning over semi-structured data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more complex datasets for math word problems that involve reasoning over heterogeneous modalities like images, tables, graphs, etc. The authors propose the TabMWP dataset as a first step, but suggest there is room for even more challenging datasets in this direction.

- Exploring different methods for learning better prompts and demonstrations for few-shot learning with large language models like GPT-3. The authors propose PromptPG in this paper, but suggest there may be other ways to learn good prompt selection policies.

- Improving the accuracy and stability of few-shot learning approaches like PromptPG. The authors achieved strong results but there is still a gap compared to human performance, and variance across different prompt selections. Reducing this gap and variance is an important direction.

- Extending the models to handle more complex mathematical reasoning, like higher-level concepts beyond arithmetic operations. The TabMWP dataset focuses on grade school level reasoning, but extending to algebra, calculus, etc. could be valuable.

- Improving the interpretability and explainability of model predictions. The authors generate step-by-step reasoning, but making the explanations more natural and human-like could be useful.

- Scaling up in terms of data size, model size, and compute resources, to push further progress. The authors rely on a medium-sized dataset and GPT-3 model, but larger data and models may help.

In summary, the core suggested directions are creating more challenging math reasoning datasets, developing better prompt learning methods, improving accuracy and stability, handling more advanced reasoning, generating better explanations, and scaling up data and models. Advancing along these fronts could lead to more capable and reliable math word problem solvers.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP), a new dataset of 38,431 math word problems that require reasoning over both textual and tabular data. The dataset contains problems taken from grade-level math curricula, where each problem includes a question text, a tabular context represented as an image, semi-structured text, and a structured table, and a detailed solution revealing the reasoning steps. There are two types of questions - free-text, where the answer is a number, and multiple-choice, where the answer is chosen from options. The paper shows that solving the problems in TabMWP requires complex reasoning across the heterogeneous textual and tabular data.

The paper evaluates several strong baselines on TabMWP, including pre-trained QA models like UnifiedQA and TAPEX, as well as GPT-3 in few-shot settings. To address the instability of few-shot learning, the paper proposes PromptPG, which uses policy gradient reinforcement learning to learn how to select good prompt examples for GPT-3 from a small amount of training data. Experiments show that PromptPG outperforms all baselines by a large margin, achieving 68.23% accuracy compared to 62.92% for few-shot GPT-3. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using reinforcement learning to dynamically construct performing prompts for few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks like TabMWP.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a new method for learning to dynamically generate prompts for the GPT-3 model via policy gradient, in order to improve its performance on mathematical reasoning tasks with semi-structured data. 

The key idea is to train an agent to select good example prompts from a candidate pool to construct an input prompt for a given test example. This allows the model to learn which types of prompt examples are most useful for different test cases, rather than relying on random selection or manually designed heuristics.

Specifically, a policy network built on top of BERT is trained with REINFORCE policy gradient. It learns to select prompt examples so as to maximize the reward on the training set, which is the accuracy of GPT-3's prediction using those examples. The policy network's parameters are updated based on the rewards. At test time, the trained policy network selects prompt examples for each test case from the candidate pool.

Experiments on a new mathematical reasoning dataset with semi-structured tabular data show this approach leads to improved accuracy and stability compared to heuristic or random prompting. The method establishes a new state-of-the-art on this dataset without any human-designed heuristics.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the challenge of mathematical reasoning over heterogeneous information for machines, particularly in the context of solving math word problems that require reasoning over both text and tables. 

Some key points:

- Existing math word problem datasets focus only on textual problems, lacking examples that require multi-hop reasoning between text and tabular data. 

- The authors present a new dataset, Tabular Math Word Problems (TabMWP), containing 38,431 math word problems aligned with tabular contexts. This is the first dataset requiring math reasoning over both text and tables.

- They evaluate strong baselines like GPT-3 on TabMWP, but find it can be unstable due to sensitivity to the selection of in-context examples for few-shot learning.

- To address this, they propose a new approach called PromptPG that utilizes policy gradient reinforcement learning to learn how to select good in-context examples from a small amount of training data.

- Experiments show PromptPG outperforms baselines by 5-6% on TabMWP and reduces instability compared to random selection of examples.

In summary, the key problem is developing methods for mathematical reasoning over heterogeneous text and tabular data, which existing datasets and models do not sufficiently address. The authors contribute a new dataset for this problem and propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach to select informative in-context examples to improve reasoning models like GPT-3.
