# [AgentBench: Evaluating LLMs as Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03688)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:

How capable are Large Language Models of acting as intelligent agents that can reason, plan, and make decisions in interactive real-world environments? Specifically, the paper aims to systematically evaluate and benchmark the performance of LLMs as autonomous agents across a diverse set of challenging environments and tasks. 

The key ideas and goals of the paper can be summarized as:

- There is an urgent need for standard benchmarks to evaluate LLMs as agents rather than just on static NLP tasks. Existing benchmarks are limited in scope.

- The paper introduces AgentBench, a new comprehensive benchmark with 8 distinct environments based on real-world use cases to test LLMs' capabilities as agents.

- AgentBench requires LLMs to demonstrate skills like following instructions, coding, knowledge acquisition and logical reasoning in interactive settings.

- The work provides a systematic comparison of 25 LLMs (APIs and open-sourced) using AgentBench to assess state-of-the-art and gaps.

- Results show top API models like GPT-4 have strong agent abilities but clear gaps exist compared to open-sourced LLMs. 

- The benchmark and evaluation toolkit are released to facilitate LLM-as-agent research.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that AgentBench can effectively benchmark the under-explored capability of LLMs to act as reasoning agents in the real world, revealing current progress and gaps. The paper presents empirical findings from a large-scale LLM evaluation using the proposed benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces the concept of evaluating LLMs as agents, and presents AgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark to standardize the evaluation. AgentBench defines 8 distinct environments based on real-world scenarios, offering a practical testbed to evaluate the wide array of capabilities of LLMs.

2. It performs a thorough evaluation of 25 different LLMs using AgentBench, uncovering a significant performance gap between leading top API-based LLMs and open-source models. The results illuminate the state-of-the-art in LLM-as-Agent and highlight areas for improvement.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my review, here is a comparison of this paper to other related research:

- This paper presents AgentBench, which is the first systematic benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) as agents across a diverse set of interactive environments. Other research has focused more narrowly on specific domains like text games or code execution environments. AgentBench covers a much broader range of tasks and challenges for LLMs.

- Most prior work on evaluating LLMs concentrates on static datasets, whereas AgentBench emphasizes practical, multi-turn interactive environments that require reasoning, planning, and decision making. This aligns better with real-world applications of LLMs as autonomous agents. 

- Many previous benchmarks for language agents are based on simulated text games or embodied agents in 3D environments. AgentBench focuses specifically on evaluating text-only LLMs without multi-modal requirements. This allows direct assessment of LLMs' language capabilities.

- The study evaluates 25 LLMs using AgentBench, including popular commercial APIs and open-source models. The scale of models tested is much larger than most prior work, providing a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art LLM performance on agent tasks.

- AgentBench systematically measures LLMs across 8 distinct task environments. Other benchmarks typically center on a single domain. The multi-dimensional nature of AgentBench enables more complete characterization of LLMs' strengths and weaknesses.

- The paper finds significant performance gaps between top commercial LLMs like GPT-4 and open-source models, unlike some recent claims that they are comparable. The rigorous testing methodology provides stronger evidence on current capabilities.

In summary, AgentBench establishes a new paradigm for LLM evaluation centered on interactive agent environments. It encompasses a uniquely broad set of challenges and provides standardized testing at scale across models. This represents an advance over prior specialized benchmarks in methodology and scope.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more complex and diverse environments and tasks to expand AgentBench to be even more comprehensive. The authors mention that there are more scenarios and tasks that could be incorporated to make the benchmark more inclusive.

- Establishing a more systematic LLM evaluation scheme. The authors are working to refine and release an evaluation scheme to standardize LLM assessment, which they plan to integrate with an enriched next version of AgentBench.

- Improving learning capabilities of open-sourced LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance gap between top commercial LLMs and open-sourced models. The authors highlight the need for more efforts to enhance the abilities of open-sourced LLMs.

- Training LLMs as more capable agents for real-world applications. While top LLMs like GPT-4 show promise, there is still distance before practical agent usability. More research is needed to develop LLMs into more potent and continuously learning agents.

- Expanding beyond text-only abilities. The current AgentBench focuses on evaluating text-only LLMs. The authors mention assessing multi-modal capabilities as an area for future work.

- Adding more models into the evaluation. The authors plan to incorporate more LLMs, especially larger open-sourced models exceeding 30B parameters, in future rounds of assessment.

In summary, the key directions involve expanding AgentBench's coverage, establishing standardized evaluation schemes, improving open-sourced LLMs, training more capable agents, assessing multi-modality, and testing more models. Advancing research in these areas can lead to more powerful and usable LLM agents.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of performing real-world tasks autonomously. The authors introduce AgentBench, a new benchmark for systematically evaluating the ability of LLMs to act as intelligent agents across diverse environments. AgentBench consists of 8 distinct challenges, including operating systems, databases, knowledge graphs, card games, puzzles, household tasks, web shopping, and general web browsing. For each environment, datasets are carefully designed to assess LLMs in interactive settings requiring reasoning, planning, and decision making. 

A comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 25 LLMs, including top commercial APIs like GPT-4 and open source models. Results showed top APIs like GPT-4 perform strongly on AgentBench, successfully solving many real-world problems. However, most open source LLMs lagged significantly behind. This reveals gaps between state-of-the-art commercial and open source LLMs in their capacity to act effectively as autonomous agents. The authors plan to expand AgentBench to more environments and release toolkits to facilitate LLM-as-agent research. Overall, this work provides an important benchmark for standardizing the evaluation of LLMs as capable, general agents.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents AgentBench, a new benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as intelligent agents in interactive environments. AgentBench consists of 8 distinct tasks spanning real-world domains like operating systems, databases, knowledge graphs, card games, puzzles, household environments, web shopping, and web browsing. Each task is designed as a multi-turn, open-ended challenge where the LLM must generate actions and reason over multiple rounds of interaction. The benchmark measures the LLM's ability to understand instructions, execute valid actions, form plans, and adapt based on environmental feedback. A total of 25 LLMs were evaluated, including top commercial APIs like GPT-4 and open-sourced models, using standardized prompting techniques. The results reveal a significant performance gap between leading commercial LLMs and their open-source counterparts in these agent-based tasks, highlighting areas for continued improvement. Overall, AgentBench provides a systematic and comprehensive way to assess LLMs as autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and decision making.
