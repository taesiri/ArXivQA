# [DOMINO: Domain-invariant Hyperdimensional Classification for   Multi-Sensor Time Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03295)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-sensor time series data is increasingly utilized in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with edge-based machine learning employed for analysis. However, a key challenge is "distribution shift", where models fail when deployed on data distributions different than training.  
- Deep neural networks address the spatial/temporal dependencies in time series data, but require substantial off-chip resources, making them impractical for many edge devices. Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a lightweight solution, but existing HDCs also suffer from distribution shift.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DOMINO, a novel HDC domain generalization (DG) framework to address distribution shift for multi-sensor time series classification. 
- DOMINO dynamically identifies and filters out domain-variant dimensions in the high-dimensional encoded vectors to enhance model generalization.
- Key steps include: 1) Domain-specific modeling to create models per domain, 2) Class-specific aggregation to form class-specific matrices, 3) Identifying dimensions with high variance indicating domain-variance, 4) Regenerating new random dimensions to replace filtered ones.
- Hardware optimizations like multi-threading, quantization are employed.

Main Contributions:
- DOMINO is the first HDC-based DG algorithm, achieving 2.04% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art with 16.34x faster training and 2.89x faster inference.
- Notably higher performance with limited labeled data (5.81% higher accuracy with 10% labeled data) and highly imbalanced data (2.58% higher accuracy).  
- 10.93x higher robustness to hardware noises than DNNs.
- Evaluated on server and embedded hardware like RPi and Jetson Nano, with lower latency and energy than DNNs.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative HDC-based DG solution called DOMINO to address distribution shift in multi-sensor time series data for edge devices. By filtering domain-variant dimensions, it achieves much higher efficiency and generalization capability than prior DNN-based techniques.
