# Otter: A Multi-Modal Model with In-Context Instruction Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we enhance multi-modal models with the abilities for in-context learning and instruction following by incorporating instruction tuning?More specifically, the key goals of this work appear to be:- To propose a new multi-modal dataset called MIMIC-IT (Multi-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning) that contains image-instruction-answer triplets along with contextual examples to support in-context learning. - To introduce a model called Otter built on top of OpenFlamingo that is trained on MIMIC-IT. Otter aims to showcase improved instruction following abilities and in-context learning compared to OpenFlamingo.- To optimize the training and implementation of OpenFlamingo to make it more accessible to researchers by reducing GPU requirements and integrating it into the HuggingFace Transformers library.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that instruction tuning and a carefully designed multi-modal dataset like MIMIC-IT can enhance multi-modal models like OpenFlamingo with stronger capacities for following instructions and learning new tasks from examples. The Otter model and optimizations to OpenFlamingo are proposed to demonstrate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing the MIMIC-IT (Multi-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning) dataset, where each data sample contains an instruction-image-answer triplet and in-context examples. - Introducing Otter, a multi-modal model built on OpenFlamingo and finetuned on MIMIC-IT. Otter shows improved ability in following instructions and learning new tasks from in-context examples compared to OpenFlamingo.- Optimizing the implementation of OpenFlamingo to make it more accessible - reducing training resource requirements and integrating into Hugging Face Transformers.In summary, the paper proposes a new multi-modal instruction tuning dataset MIMIC-IT, an instruction-tuned multi-modal model Otter based on OpenFlamingo, and engineering optimizations to improve the accessibility of large multi-modal models. The key innovation is incorporating in-context learning examples into instruction tuning for multi-modal models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper introduces Otter, a multi-modal foundation model that enhances OpenFlamingo with improved instruction following abilities and in-context learning. Otter is trained on a new Multi-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-IT) dataset and integrated into Hugging Face Transformers for easy reuse.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in multi-modal foundation models:- It proposes a new multi-modal in-context instruction tuning (MIMIC-IT) dataset. This is a novel contribution compared to prior work like Multi-Instruct, Mini-GPT4, and LLaVA that focused on instruction tuning datasets without in-context examples. - It introduces Otter, a model tuned on MIMIC-IT data and optimized from OpenFlamingo. Otter shows stronger instruction following abilities and in-context learning compared to the base OpenFlamingo model. Other models like LLaMA-Adapters and Mini-GPT4 also aim to adapt a pretrained model into an instruction follower, but do not leverage in-context learning.- The paper optimizes OpenFlamingo's implementation and integrates it into HuggingFace Transformers. This engineering contribution makes OpenFlamingo more accessible to researchers compared to the original non-optimized implementation. - Otter trains only cross-attention layers on top of frozen pretrained encoders. In contrast, some other models like LLaVA finetune the entire model, which is more expensive. Otter strikes a balance between full finetuning and adapter-based tuning.- The paper analytically compares different categories of recent work on multi-modal models, distinguishing the system design vs end-to-end trainable model perspectives. This provides useful context and motivation.Overall, the novel MIMIC-IT dataset, Otter model design, engineering optimizations, and comparative analysis make valuable contributions advancing the state-of-the-art in instruction-tuned multi-modal models. The in-context learning focus is a unique aspect not explored substantially in prior work.
