# [Learning to Generate Text in Arbitrary Writing Styles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating text that matches an author's specific writing style based on a small sample of their writing is challenging, especially for instruction-tuned language models. 
- Capturing subtle, author-specific stylistic features that characterize how an individual writes is difficult.
- There is a tension between achieving fluent text generation according to a generic language model, and adhering to an author's potentially unusual or unlikely word choices that characterize their unique style.

Proposed Solution:
- Use a contrastively-trained style representation model to extract stylistic features from a small writing sample into a dense vector.
- Guide text generation using this vector with a re-scoring model to make an author-specific language model.
- Further control style at the sequence level with an energy-based discriminative model using the author-specific LM as an expert.
- Additional experts can be added for other constraints e.g. meaning preservation.

Main Contributions:
- Competitive performance in author style matching compared to prompting large models, using far fewer parameters.
- Style vector interpolations give interpretable control over stylistic attributes like capitalization and punctuation.
- Effective for style transfer/anonymization, balancing target style and meaning preservation.
- Highlights tension between author style adherence and fluency; uses specialized author-specific LM to improve style matching.
- Combination of modified autoregressive decoding and sequence-level discriminative control is uniquely effective for author style control.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach using both a specialized author-specific language model and sequence-level discriminative control to effectively generate text matching an arbitrary author's writing style from a small sample.
