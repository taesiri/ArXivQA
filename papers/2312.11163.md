# [Energy-Aware Hierarchical Control of Joint Velocities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11163)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots operating in dynamic environments need to perform several tasks simultaneously, such as reaching a goal pose while avoiding obstacles. These different tasks can conflict with each other when mapped to the robot's configuration space.  
- Existing hierarchical control approaches suffer from discontinuous control signals when task priorities change, and often do not fully avoid conflicts between tasks. They are also typically specialized for either torque, velocity or acceleration control.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents a hierarchical velocity control approach that ensures smooth transitions when task priorities change based on importance metrics. 
- It allows trading off kinetic energy usage and tracking error for lower priority tasks through a weighted pseudoinverse formulation.  
- The approach is comprehensively analyzed to distinguish capabilities for velocity, acceleration and torque control in terms of task mapping and nullspace projection characteristics.

Main Contributions:
- Providing a comprehensive discussion on differences between velocity, acceleration and torque control in hierarchical tasks.
- Formulation of a hierarchical velocity control algorithm that rearranges tasks based on importance metrics and ensures continuous smooth control signals.
- Allows trading off energy usage versus tracking error for lower priority tasks.
- Demonstrating real-time computational efficiency of the approach with experiments using two 7-DOF Franka robot arms involving four simultaneous tasks.

In summary, the key innovation is an advanced hierarchical velocity control approach that adapts task priorities online based on an importance measure, guarantees smooth transitions and allows customizable nullspace projections, with efficient performance demonstrated on robot hardware.
