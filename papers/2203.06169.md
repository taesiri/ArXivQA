# [LaPraDoR: Unsupervised Pretrained Dense Retriever for Zero-Shot Text   Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06169)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we develop an unsupervised pretrained dense retriever that can achieve strong performance on diverse downstream tasks without requiring any labeled data? The authors propose Laprador (LaPraDoR), a pretrained dual-tower dense retriever, to address this question. The two key components of their approach are:1) Iterative Contrastive Learning (ICoL): An efficient pretraining method that iteratively trains the query and document encoders using contrastive learning objectives and a caching mechanism. This allows using a large number of negative samples to improve representation quality without running into GPU memory limitations.2) Lexicon-Enhanced Dense Retrieval (LEDR): A simple yet effective technique to incorporate lexical matching signals from BM25 into the dense retriever, making it more robust for zero-shot transfer.The central hypothesis is that by pretraining LaPraDoR in an unsupervised manner on a large diverse corpus using ICoL and then enhancing it with LEDR, the model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream zero-shot text retrieval tasks across different domains. The experiments on the BEIR benchmark verify this hypothesis, showing the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.In summary, the paper focuses on unsupervised pretraining for zero-shot dense retrieval, with LaPraDoR being proposed as a solution. ICoL and LEDR are presented as key technical innovations to make this viable.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing LaPraDoR, an unsupervised pretrained dense retriever for zero-shot text retrieval. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Proposing LaPraDoR, a fully unsupervised pretrained retriever that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BEIR benchmark for zero-shot text retrieval, outperforming supervised dense retrieval models. 2.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in unsupervised text retrieval:- This is the first paper I'm aware of proposing a fully unsupervised pretrained dense retriever. Most other work in dense retrieval relies on some supervised data, either for pretraining (e.g. DPR) or fine-tuning (e.g. ANCE). The unsupervised pretraining approach allows the model to generalize better to new domains.- The proposed Iterative Contrastive Learning (ICoL) training approach is novel for dense retrieval, though it builds on prior work in contrastive representation learning like MoCo. ICoL seems more suitable for training retrieval encoders compared to vanilla MoCo.- Applying lexical matching as a way to enhance unsupervised dense retrievers is a simple but impactful idea. Most prior work formulates lexical matching as reranking on top of dense retrieval. The proposed Lexicon-Enhanced Dense Retrieval (LEDR) gives better efficiency.- Evaluation on the BEIR benchmark allows comprehensive comparison to state-of-the-art supervised models across diverse domains. The strong zero-shot performance of LaPraDoR highlights the effectiveness of unsupervised pretraining for retrieval.- After fine-tuning on MS MARCO, LaPraDoR outperforms all previous systems on BEIR, including reranking approaches, while being much faster. This demonstrates the potential of unsupervised pretraining as a new paradigm.Overall, the unsupervised pretraining approach, simple yet effective training method, and fast lexical matching integration make this work stand out compared to prior research. The strong empirical results verify the viability of unsupervised dense retrievers for generalized zero-shot retrieval across domains.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Extending unsupervised LaPraDoR to multilingual and multi-modal retrieval. The current work focuses on monolingual English text retrieval. The authors suggest exploring unsupervised pretrained retrieval for other languages and modalities.- Incorporating knowledge into the pretrained retriever. The authors mention investigating knowledge-enhanced pretraining objectives to improve the model's reasoning ability. - Studying the model's capability in low-data transfer learning settings. The authors suggest analyzing few-shot and zero-shot transfer learning capabilities of the pretrained dense retriever.- Exploring unsupervised adaption techniques for domain transfer. The authors suggest developing unsupervised domain adaptation methods to further improve the model's generalization ability across domains.- Analyzing the pretrained representations. The authors suggest using analytical methods to understand what lexical, syntactic, semantic information is captured by the pretrained dense representations.- Combining late interaction models with the pretrained retriever. The authors suggest exploring integrating late interaction models like CoIL with the lexicon-enhanced dense retriever.In summary, the main future directions are: multilingual and multimodal extension, knowledge incorporation, low-data transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, representation analysis, and integration with late interaction models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces LaPraDoR, an unsupervised pretrained dense retriever for zero-shot text retrieval. The authors propose Iterative Contrastive Learning (ICoL) to iteratively train the query and document encoders with a cache mechanism, which enlarges the number of negative instances and keeps cached examples aligned in the representation space. They also propose Lexicon-Enhanced Dense Retrieval (LEDR) to enhance dense retrieval with lexical matching in a fast and effective way, compared to re-ranking. Without any supervised data, LaPraDoR outperforms all dense retrievers on the BEIR benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance when further fine-tuned. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy and objectives. LaPraDoR with LEDR is much faster than re-ranking while achieving better performance. The work highlights the potential of unsupervised learning for dense retrieval and introduces an efficient way to combine lexical and semantic matching.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes LaPraDoR, an unsupervised pretrained dense retriever for zero-shot text retrieval. LaPraDoR uses a dual-tower architecture with a query encoder and a document encoder. It is trained with a novel pretraining approach called Iterative Contrastive Learning (ICoL) which iteratively trains the query and document encoders while caching encoded representations to serve as negative samples. This allows for more negative examples during training while keeping representations aligned in the same space. LaPraDoR also incorporates a simple yet effective technique called Lexicon-Enhanced Dense Retrieval (LEDR) to combine lexical matching signals from BM25 with the dense representations. Experiments are conducted on the BEIR benchmark which contains 18 datasets over 9 text retrieval tasks. Without any supervised fine-tuning, LaPraDoR outperforms previous state-of-the-art dense retrievers on 13 of the 18 datasets. With supervised fine-tuning on MS-MARCO, LaPraDoR achieves new state-of-the-art results on BEIR, outperforming re-ranking approaches while being over 20x faster. Ablation studies demonstrate the contribution of the proposed ICoL training strategy and incorporation of lexical matching. Overall, LaPraDoR shows strong zero-shot retrieval abilities and establishes a new paradigm for unsupervised dense retrieval.
