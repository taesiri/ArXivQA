# [Unsupervised Auditory and Semantic Entrainment Models with Deep Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Entrainment is an important phenomenon in spoken interactions where speakers adapt aspects of their speech to become more similar to their interlocutor. It is linked to positive outcomes like cooperation, task success, etc. 
- Existing methods to measure entrainment often assume a linear relationship and cannot capture its complex nature. 
- There is a need for models that can assess both auditory and semantic entrainment in human-human (HH) and human-machine (HM) interactions using different features and units of analysis.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using a deep neural network (DNN) based architecture called Neural Entrainment Distance (NED) to model entrainment. 
- For auditory entrainment, they use an autoencoder architecture to learn representations and measure NED between bottleneck features.
- For semantic entrainment, they augment the architecture with an additional loss term to learn semantic similarity between speaker turns.
- They extract different auditory (LLDs, TRILL) and semantic (BERT, USE) features from units of analysis like inter-pausal units and speaker turns.

Main Contributions:
- Measuring both auditory and semantic entrainment using a common DNN architecture.
- Testing the impact of different features and units of analysis on model performance.
- Evaluating the models on HH (Fisher, Columbia Games) and HM (VACC) corpora using 10-fold cross-validation.
- Finding comparable performance between units of analysis, ability to distinguish HH vs HM interactions, and superior performance of TRILL vectors and BERT embeddings.

In summary, the paper proposes an architecture to measure auditory and semantic entrainment using different input features and validates it across multiple corpora, gaining useful insights on the factors impacting model performance.
