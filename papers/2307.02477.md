# [Reasoning or Reciting? Exploring the Capabilities and Limitations of   Language Models Through Counterfactual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02477)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: to what extent does the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on various NLP tasks derive from their ability to deploy task-general reasoning skills, versus their ability to recognize and recall patterns from the specific default task variants they were trained on? 

In other words, the paper investigates whether LLMs truly acquire abstract reasoning abilities that allow them to generalize to novel tasks and conditions, or whether their capabilities are more superficial and heavily tuned to the default training conditions. To test this, the authors propose evaluating models on counterfactual variants of tasks that require the same reasoning skills but differ in their surface input-output mappings. They design counterfactual evaluation suites across 11 tasks and find that model performance substantially degrades on counterfactual variants, suggesting their abilities do not fully transfer but rather are tailored to frequent default conditions.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that LLMs overfit their reasoning skills to frequent default task variants seen during pretraining, rather than learning abstract reasoning abilities. Their counterfactual evaluation methodology aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper investigates is: To what extent does the strong performance of large language models (LLMs) on various tasks derive from their ability to deploy task-general reasoning skills, versus their ability to recognize and recall specific tasks seen frequently during pre-training?

In other words, the paper is examining whether the impressive capabilities exhibited by LLMs are due to the models learning generalizable reasoning skills that can transfer to novel situations, or whether their strengths are largely driven by overfitting to the default conditions and frequent task variants encountered during pretraining. 

The authors test this by evaluating LLMs on counterfactual variants of tasks - altered versions that require the same reasoning skills but have different input-output mappings. They find that performance substantially degrades on counterfactual tasks relative to default tasks, even when the models seem to comprehend the new task setups. 

This suggests that the models' reasoning abilities are heavily reliant on recognizing default conditions, and their impressive performance should not be taken as fully indicative of task-general reasoning capacity. Evaluating counterfactual variants helps tease apart these factors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a systematic study of large language models' ability to perform reasoning under counterfactual conditions. The key contribution is proposing counterfactual evaluation as a new paradigm to assess models' generalization and abstract reasoning skills. 

Specifically, the authors take 11 tasks that models can perform well under default conditions, and evaluate the same models under counterfactual conditions where the rules or assumptions of the task are changed. For example, they evaluate arithmetic ability under different number bases rather than just base 10, spatial reasoning under axis rotations, and drawing objects under flipping/rotations.

The main finding is that while models exhibit some counterfactual reasoning ability, their performance substantially degrades compared to the default conditions. This reveals limitations in their generalization and abstract reasoning - the good default performance may largely stem from recognizing familiar instantiations of tasks and memorization, rather than employing task-general skills and procedures. The consistent gap across diverse tasks illustrates the challenge of out-of-distribution generalization for current LMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing counterfactual evaluation to quantify models' ability to perform conceptual reasoning in unfamiliar environments. The results reveal limitations in modern LMs' reasoning skills when contrasted with their performance on naturalistic tasks distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that large language models exhibit a substantial performance gap between default task conditions commonly found in their training data and novel counterfactual conditions. Specifically:

- The authors evaluate several recent large language models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, and PaLM-2, on 11 different reasoning tasks across domains like arithmetic, programming, logic, and music. 

- For each task, they devise counterfactual conditions that alter the rules or setup of the task while maintaining the same underlying reasoning required. Examples include evaluating arithmetic in non-base-10 systems, using 1-based indexing for Python code, and retrieving melodies transposed into different keys.

- Across all the tasks, they find that model performance significantly degrades on the counterfactual variants compared to the default conditions, even though the abstract reasoning procedure remains unchanged. The models are robustly fooled by these small deviations from the default worlds they were trained on.

- The authors argue this reveals that the impressive performance of large language models on many benchmark tasks is partly attributable to overfitting the quirks and patterns of default conditions frequently seen during training, rather than learning truly generalizable reasoning skills.

In summary, by evaluating models on carefully constructed counterfactual tasks, this paper provides evidence that large neural language models have not fully learned abstract reasoning abilities and are still heavily shaped by the specifics of their training distributions. The paper encourages future model analysis to focus on generalizable reasoning skills in addition to observed task performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in evaluating reasoning abilities of large language models:

- The idea of using counterfactual evaluation to probe model capabilities is novel and provides an interesting new perspective. Most prior work has focused on evaluating generalization to new instances or concepts, rather than new task variants. 

- The range of tasks considered is quite broad, spanning different modalities like language, vision, music etc. This provides a more comprehensive assessment than just focusing on a single domain.

- The analysis investigating how factors like task/condition frequency, proximity to default conditions etc. affect performance is insightful. It sheds light on the interplay between reasoning, robustness, generalization and memorization effects.

- The limitations around potential underestimation or overestimation of abilities are well articulated. The authors rightly point out that we can never fully know the distribution of counterfactual conditions in pretraining data.

- Compared to some other analyses that do ablation studies or tweak model architectures/training, this work focuses on probing the capabilities of large pretrained models as they are. In that sense, it provides a pragmatic test of how these models might perform "out of the box" on new tasks.

- The inclusion of human evaluations for drawing and chord tasks is useful, as automatically evaluating those is hard. The CCC is also a nice way to verify counterfactual condition comprehension.

- The correlation analyses between default and counterfactual performance are insightful. It suggests reasoning abilities may co-exist with memorization to varying degrees.

Overall, I find this to be a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of model capabilities using the lens of counterfactual analysis. The setups are creative, the analysis is nuanced, and limitations are clearly articulated. It advances our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of large pretrained LMs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper comparing to other research in the field of evaluating reasoning abilities of large language models:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new evaluation methodology based on counterfactual reasoning, instead of just evaluating models on the default task variants they are likely exposed to during pretraining. This provides a more rigorous test of true reasoning abilities. Other work has focused more on instance-level generalization, which can be confounded by data contamination issues.

- The counterfactual evaluation spans a diverse set of 11 tasks across different domains like arithmetic, programming, logic, and music. Many prior works have tended to focus evaluation on just one or two tasks. The breadth here allows more comprehensive conclusions. 

- The analysis relating performance to the "commonness" of counterfactual conditions provides more nuance than a binary default vs counterfactual view. It shows reasoning can be a continuum between memorization and true abstraction. Other papers have generally not delved into this type of analysis.

- The paper bridges connections of this evaluation methodology to ideas like causality, intensional semantics, and competence vs performance distinctions from linguistics and cognitive science. This relates the work more broadly to theories of reasoning.

- The consideration of limitations around underestimation and overestimation of abilities reflects rigor and care in the evaluation design. Many papers do not explicitly discuss such limitations and risks.

- Overall, the counterfactual evaluation approach seems quite novel compared to existing work. The paper is thorough in spanning diverse tasks, analyzing different factors carefully, and drawing connections to related theories. The limitations are also clearly acknowledged. This helps advance understanding of evaluating reasoning versus memorization.

In summary, the counterfactual evaluation methodology enables more rigorous testing of reasoning skills in a thorough and rigorous manner compared to much existing research. The paper represents an important advance in methodology and analysis for this problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions based on their work:

- Explore more advanced prompting techniques like self-prompting and iterative prompting to see if they can further reduce the gap between default and counterfactual performance. The authors tried chain-of-thought prompting in this work but it did not fully eliminate the gap.

- Conduct similar counterfactual evaluations on models with different architectures, pretraining datasets, and fine-tuning strategies to better understand what factors affect robustness to counterfactual shifts. 

- Explore other types of counterfactual conditions beyond the ones studied here to further probe the reasoning abilities of large language models.

- Conduct similar counterfactual evaluations directly with humans to better contextualize the results and understand if the limitations are fundamental or specific to current AI systems.

- Develop new training or fine-tuning methodologies to improve model robustness to counterfactual shifts, potentially inspired by techniques from causality, domain generalization, continual learning etc.

- Analyze model representations and internal mechanisms, for example via probing classifiers, to better understand the source of the drop in counterfactual performance.

- Scale up evaluations to even larger models to see if some of the overfitting effects can be overcome by scale alone.

In summary, the main future directions are developing better training/fine-tuning techniques to improve counterfactual robustness, more in-depth analysis into the source of the overfitting, and exploration of additional counterfactual tasks and models. The results indicate current models are still substantially overfitting default conditions despite their strong performance.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Exploring more advanced prompting techniques like iterative/self prompting to try to further reduce the gap between default and counterfactual performance. The authors tried chain-of-thought prompting but found it did not fully eliminate the gap. More sophisticated prompting may help bridge it further.

- Testing other open-source language models besides the commercial models tested in the paper. The authors mentioned they tried some initial experiments but the open-source models had issues following instructions well. As open-source models continue to improve, it would be interesting to revisit counterfactual evaluation on them.

- Evaluating human performance on the counterfactual tasks. The authors hypothesized humans may show some drop in counterfactual conditions but have the competence to adapt with sufficient time. Testing this experimentally could shed more light.

- Expanding the variety of counterfactual perturbations, for example to entirely new tasks rather than variations of existing ones. The authors focused on changing the conditions/rules of known tasks, but evaluating on new tasks could further probe generalization.

- Developing better automated metrics for evaluating counterfactual generations, as human evaluation was needed for some tasks like drawing. More reliable automatic evaluation could enable easier scaling up.

- Exploring the correlation between default and counterfactual performance across a wider range of models, and investigating what factors drive this relationship.

Overall, the authors propose counterfactual evaluation as a useful paradigm for analyzing models, and suggest further work on tasks, conditions, models, evaluation, and analysis to develop a more complete understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a counterfactual evaluation methodology to examine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LMs). It creates counterfactual variants of 11 different tasks by altering the conditions or rules under which they are performed. For example, the arithmetic task is changed to use different bases instead of base 10. The same core reasoning is still required in the counterfactual tasks, but the specific input-output mappings differ. The authors evaluate several recent LMs, including GPT-4 and PaLM-2, on both the default and counterfactual versions of each task. They find that performance substantially degrades on the counterfactual variants despite high accuracy on comprehension checks, indicating the models' reasoning is tailored to default conditions seen during pretraining rather than being based on generalizable skills. The results reveal limitations in abstraction and adaptation to novel situations in current LMs, highlighting the need to disentangle reasoning ability from task performance that may rely on recognizing familiar conditions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a counterfactual evaluation methodology to assess the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LMs) beyond their ability to simply memorize and recite patterns seen during pretraining. The authors devise 11 tasks spanning domains like arithmetic, programming, logic, and music where the default condition follows common assumptions while counterfactual variants introduce atypical but fair changes to the task structure or world model. Across strong recent LMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, and PaLM, they observe substantially lower performance in counterfactual conditions compared to the default, even when the models seem to comprehend the counterfactual setup based on "comprehension check" questions. This gap indicates overfitting to default conditions and that the models do not robustly acquire abstract reasoning skills despite their strong performance when tasks closely resemble pretraining data. The authors discuss limitations around potential underestimation or overestimation of reasoning abilities and highlight opportunities for designing models with stronger generalization.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a counterfactual evaluation framework to assess language models' reasoning abilities beyond their performance on familiar default task variants. It argues that high performance on default tasks may be confounded by overfitting effects rather than general reasoning capacity. To control for this, the authors construct counterfactual tasks that share the same reasoning procedure as the original task but under different conditions. For example, they evaluate arithmetic ability using uncommon bases like 9 and 11 instead of the default base 10. 

Across 11 tasks spanning domains like logic, programming, music, games, and drawing, they find that language models like GPT-3/4 exhibit substantially reduced performance under counterfactual conditions compared to the default, even when controlling for comprehension of the counterfactual setup. This reveals limitations in abstract reasoning ability detached from familiar instantiations. The gaps diminish but persist with techniques like prompting for step-by-step reasoning. Overall, the results illustrate the need to disentangle reasoning capacity from overfitting effects when assessing language models, especially on default tasks that may be abundant during pretraining.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes evaluating large language models (LLMs) using counterfactual perturbations of tasks they excel at. Rather than assessing generalization to new inputs, the authors alter the underlying conditions and rules of tasks to create counterfactual variants. For example, they evaluate arithmetic ability using different number bases rather than just base 10. The goal is to test whether strong performance is due to generalizable reasoning skills or overfitting to default task settings which are prevalent during pretraining. 

Across 11 counterfactually altered tasks spanning domains like logic, spatial reasoning, programming, and music, the authors find LLM performance substantially degrades compared to the default variants. Counterfactual comprehension checks confirm the models understand the new conditions. The gaps indicate LLMs rely heavily on non-transferable knowledge tied to default task settings, rather than learning abstract reasoning processes. The results highlight the need to disentangle reasoning capacity from observed performance, especially when default task variants exist abundantly in pretraining data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a counterfactual evaluation approach to assess language models' reasoning abilities and guard against overestimation of their capacities. Rather than evaluating models on standard test sets that may be contaminated with training data, the authors create counterfactual variants of tasks by altering the conditions or rules under which they are performed. For example, they evaluate arithmetic ability under different number bases rather than just base 10, and drawing ability when objects are rotated or flipped. The same reasoning procedure is required in the counterfactual tasks but the input-output mapping changes. The authors measure the performance gap between default and counterfactual conditions across several reasoning tasks like logical deduction, spatial reasoning, programming, and music. They generally find a substantial decline in counterfactual performance, even when models seem competent at the original tasks. The authors interpret this as evidence that impressive reasoning abilities demonstrated by large language models may stem from memorization of frequent default task variants rather than generalizable reasoning. Counterfactual evaluation helps discount these effects.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a counterfactual evaluation framework to assess language models' (LMs) reasoning abilities, detached from their performance on frequently seen default task variants. For several tasks that LMs are known to perform well on, such as arithmetic, spatial reasoning, and deductive reasoning, the authors devise counterfactual variants where the general reasoning procedure remains unchanged but the specific input-output mappings differ from the default conditions. For example, they evaluate arithmetic in different number bases, spatial reasoning under rotated coordinate axes, and deductive reasoning with premises altered to contradict common sense. They prompt large LMs like GPT-3 and PaLM with these counterfactual tasks and find that performance substantially degrades compared to the default tasks, even when controlling for the counterfactual conditions being properly understood. This reveals these LMs' reasoning abilities are partly dependent on overfitting to frequent default task variants, rather than fully abstract reasoning skills. The framework provides a way to inspect the generalization of LMs' reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the main problem this paper is addressing is evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond their performance on common benchmark tasks. Specifically, the authors are interested in assessing how well LLMs can generalize their reasoning skills to novel situations and task variants, rather than just memorizing patterns from their training data. 

To evaluate this, the paper proposes using "counterfactual evaluation", where the rules or conditions of a task are changed to create counterfactual variants. For example, instead of evaluating arithmetic in base 10, they test LLMs on addition in bases 8, 9, 11, and 16. The idea is that performance on these counterfactual tasks, compared to the default tasks, gives a sense of how much the models' reasoning abilities generalize beyond memorization of frequent training examples. 

The paper designs counterfactual variants for 11 different tasks spanning domains like arithmetic, programming, logic, music, games, and drawing. Across all the tasks, they find that LLM performance substantially decreases on the counterfactual variants compared to the normal default tasks, even though the core reasoning skills required remain the same. This suggests that the LLM's abilities are significantly supported by memorization of default conditions, rather than fully generalizable reasoning.

In summary, the main problem is assessing LLM reasoning abilities beyond training data memorization, and the paper tackles this by using counterfactual evaluation to test generalization to novel task variants. The consistent gaps found imply limitations in current LLM reasoning capacities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Counterfactual evaluation - The paper proposes evaluating language models on counterfactual variants or perturbations of tasks to measure their ability to generalize beyond memorizing or overfitting to default conditions.

- Reasoning vs reciting - The title refers to assessing whether language models' capabilities derive from general reasoning skills or recitation of memorized patterns. Counterfactual evaluation helps distinguish between the two.

- Task-conditioned reasoning - The goal is to evaluate reasoning skills conditioned on a task, not just generalization to new instances. The paper aims to test adaptation to new task variants and rules.

- Overfitting - A key concern is that language models may be overfitting to default task conditions frequently seen during pretraining, rather than learning general procedures. Counterfactual evaluation surface this.

- Generalization - The paper investigates generalization to counterfactual worlds as a dimension of assessing language models, in contrast to generalization to new input-output pairs.

- World models - The tasks are formalized in terms of an input, output, and world model that encapsulates task conditions. Counterfactual worlds alter the latter.

- Counterfactual comprehension check - Prompts are designed to check language models' understanding of counterfactual conditions.

- Reasoning tasks - The suite covers arithmetic, programming, logic, spatial reasoning, drawing, music, chess, SET game, and syntax.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around counterfactual evaluation to assess the reasoning abilities of language models beyond pattern memorization or recitation. The paper introduces this methodology and applies it across diverse reasoning tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes evaluating language models (LMs) by testing their performance on counterfactual variants of tasks they are trained on. How does this approach help assess the reasoning abilities of LMs versus just their ability to memorize patterns from the training data?

2. The authors generate counterfactual tasks by altering the "world state" or rules underlying familiar tasks. How does this differ from just testing the LMs on novel inputs? Why is it a more rigorous way to evaluate generalizable reasoning skills?

3. The paper introduces the idea of a "counterfactual comprehension check" (CCC) to ensure the LMs understand the altered rules of the counterfactual tasks. Why is this an important control when evaluating performance on counterfactuals? How could the results be misinterpreted without this check?

4. Across the 11 counterfactual tasks tested, the authors observe substantially degraded performance relative to the original tasks. However, performance is rarely at chance levels. How might you explain the consistency of this pattern? What factors could be responsible?

5. The paper argues the performance gaps stem from overfitting to the default training conditions rather than possessing general reasoning skills. But might the counterfactual worlds just be more difficult or unfamiliar? How does the design of the study account for this alternative explanation?

6. When does the paper find the smallest performance gaps between default and counterfactual conditions? How do properties like task frequency, proximity to defaults, and comprehension check scores help explain this?

7. For a few tasks, stronger default performance correlates with larger counterfactual deficits. Why might greater capability on a default task hurt capability on counterfactuals? When would you expect the reverse?

8. How effective is zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting at improving counterfactual performance? When does it fall short? What factors may determine its efficacy?

9. The paper argues human performance would likely remain high given ample time and practice with counterfactuals. Do you agree? Why (not)? What evidence supports this claim?

10. What are the limitations of evaluating abstract reasoning via counterfactual tasks? What complementary approaches could help strengthen conclusions about LMs' reasoning capacities?
