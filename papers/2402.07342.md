# [Imagining a Future of Designing with AI: Dynamic Grounding, Constructive   Negotiation, and Sustainable Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current AI systems lack unique capabilities to support human design processes compared to past technologies
- It's unclear what value natural language AI models can provide over classical methods to aid in collaborating with human designers

Proposed Solution:
- Identify 3 unique affordances of large language models: 
  1. Dynamic Grounding: Allows users to ground communication with AI in their own ad-hoc notations rather than submitting to the machine's constraints 
  2. Constructive Negotiation: AI can engage in moderate, well-managed conflict to constructively critique design ideas and explore alternatives
  3. Sustainable Motivation: AI can understand user context to help maintain motivation/productivity over long design timeframes 
- Imagine a realistic future interface demonstrating these affordances through a design fiction scenario ("Story of Squirrel Game")

Main Contributions:
- Defines 3 affordances above to characterize potential of LLMs to support design processes
- Uses design fiction method to ideate aspirational scenario showcasing affordances in plausible context
- Provides conceptual framework, terminology, diagrams to ground future discussions on human-AI collaboration for design
- Discusses system requirements and challenges to realize proposed affordances in practice

In summary, the paper identifies unique ways AI models can aid design work by reversing traditional human-computer power dynamics. It demonstrates these theoretically through an imagined but realistic interface scenario, laying conceptual groundwork to guide future research focused on developing human-AI collaborative systems for designers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes three unique affordances of foundation models compared to past technologies when designing AI systems to support human design processes - dynamic grounding (reversing traditional power dynamics when establishing common ground), constructive negotiation (managing appropriate, moderate conflict to strengthen ideas), and sustainable motivation (adapting to user context over long timeframes to maintain focus and flow).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting three key affordances of large language models for supporting design work:

1) Dynamic grounding: The ability for AI models to ground communication with users in the users' preferred, potentially ephemeral notations and interactions rather than requiring users to submit to the machine's notation. This shifts the traditional power dynamic where the machine grounds the user.

2) Constructive negotiation: The ability for AI models to engage in moderate, managed conflict with users over their ideas in order to strengthen design concepts. This moves beyond framing AI tools as solely assistants, elicitors, or executors of user intent.

3) Sustainable motivation: The ability for AI models to understand user context in order to help users persist on projects over long timescales through context-aware suggestions, planning, and reactions to real-world contingencies that require improvisation. 

The paper illustrates these affordances through a fictional design fiction scenario of a girl designing a 2D game about squirrels with the help of an AI design tool. The authors use the scenario to ground a conceptual discussion on requirements and challenges towards realizing such a system. Their goal is to provide researchers with clarity and terminology for discussing value propositions of AI for design.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- Foundation models
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Dynamic grounding
- Constructive negotiation 
- Sustainable motivation
- Affordances
- Human-AI collaboration

- Scenario-based design
- Activity theory
- Using language

The paper introduces and defines three key affordances of large language models for supporting design work: dynamic grounding, constructive negotiation, and sustainable motivation. It also uses methods like design fiction and scenario-based design to imagine and realize these affordances through a prototype called "Game Jammer". The scenario centers around a fictional character named Alice designing a squirrel-themed video game. Additional key terms come from relevant literature in fields like activity theory, linguistics, and human-computer interaction that the authors draw on to motivate the affordances.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes three key affordances of foundation models for design: dynamic grounding, constructive negotiation, and sustainable motivation. How might these affordances interact or conflict with one another in a real system? For example, might the need for sustainable motivation reduce opportunities for constructive negotiation at times?

2. The fictional system Game Jammer seems to rely heavily on natural language interaction. What other interaction modalities could augment or replace natural language as input and output in such a system? How might that impact the realization of the three proposed affordances?

3. The concept of "localized position" in the design space is introduced. What specific representation(s) of the design space could enable an AI system to track this localized position? How can the system update its model of position as the user iterates?

4. Intent elicitation and disambiguation are discussed as important to the success of such a system. What existing NLP techniques for elicitation and disambiguation are best suited to this design context? How might they need to be adapted? 

5. The paper argues constructive negotiation should be in "moderate amounts." How can an AI system determine what constitutes a moderate amount of negotiation for a given user and design scenario? What signals should modulate the frequency and intensity of negotiation?

6. Tropes and stereotypes are acknowledged as a potential downside of AI-generated suggestions. How might an AI design tool discern between helpful, creative suggestions versus unoriginal, clich√©d ones during negotiation?

7. The fictional system integrates the user's designs across levels of abstraction. What software architectures and representations would enable this integration? How can integration be maintained efficiently as the design iterates?

8. How can privacy, transparency, and control be maintained in a system that relies heavily on user modeling and memory like the one proposed?

9. Does the approach generalize well to collaborative design with multiple stakeholders providing input? If not, what adaptations would be required?

10. The paper focuses on game design. How well do the proposed affordances and system requirements transfer to other open-ended, creative design domains like writing, engineering, fashion, etc.? What key differences exist across domains?
