# [Imagining a Future of Designing with AI: Dynamic Grounding, Constructive   Negotiation, and Sustainable Motivation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current AI systems lack unique capabilities to support human design processes compared to past technologies
- It's unclear what value natural language AI models can provide over classical methods to aid in collaborating with human designers

Proposed Solution:
- Identify 3 unique affordances of large language models: 
  1. Dynamic Grounding: Allows users to ground communication with AI in their own ad-hoc notations rather than submitting to the machine's constraints 
  2. Constructive Negotiation: AI can engage in moderate, well-managed conflict to constructively critique design ideas and explore alternatives
  3. Sustainable Motivation: AI can understand user context to help maintain motivation/productivity over long design timeframes 
- Imagine a realistic future interface demonstrating these affordances through a design fiction scenario ("Story of Squirrel Game")

Main Contributions:
- Defines 3 affordances above to characterize potential of LLMs to support design processes
- Uses design fiction method to ideate aspirational scenario showcasing affordances in plausible context
- Provides conceptual framework, terminology, diagrams to ground future discussions on human-AI collaboration for design
- Discusses system requirements and challenges to realize proposed affordances in practice

In summary, the paper identifies unique ways AI models can aid design work by reversing traditional human-computer power dynamics. It demonstrates these theoretically through an imagined but realistic interface scenario, laying conceptual groundwork to guide future research focused on developing human-AI collaborative systems for designers.
