# [Beyond Surface Similarity: Detecting Subtle Semantic Shifts in Financial   Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14341)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper introduces a new NLP task called Financial-STS, which aims to measure the subtle semantic shifts between pairs of financial narratives from a company's financial statements over time (e.g year-over-year). 
- Detecting these subtle shifts is important for financial decision making, but existing semantic textual similarity (STS) methods and pretrained embeddings fail to capture them adequately.

Proposed Method:
- The authors identify 4 types of subtle semantic shifts that are important - intensified sentiment, elaborated details, plan realization, and emerging situations.  
- They prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate augmented financial sentence pairs exhibiting those semantic shifts.
- This augmented dataset is used to train a triplet network to differentiate sentence pairs with vs without semantic shifts.

Main Contributions:  
- Introduction of Financial-STS, a new financial NLP task focused on detecting subtle semantic shifts in paired financial narratives over time.
- A comprehensive pipeline using LLM prompting and triplet network training to effectively discern those shifts.
- Release of FinSTS, a financial semantic similarity dataset with both LLM-augmented and human-annotated subsets.
- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing STS methods and LLM embeddings in capturing nuanced financial narrative shifts.

In summary, the paper presents a novel method and dataset to address the challenging and significant problem of understanding subtle changes in financial narratives, which has potential value for financial analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the Financial-STS task for measuring subtle semantic shifts between pairs of superficially similar financial narratives from corporate reports, proposes a method using language models to generate augmented training data and a triplet network to learn effective financial sentence embeddings, and demonstrates superior performance over existing semantic textual similarity methods on a new dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces a new financial NLP task called Financial-STS (Financial Semantic Textual Similarity). This task focuses on measuring the subtle semantic shifts between pairs of financial narratives that have high surface similarity but may differ in their underlying semantics.

2) It identifies and defines four common types of subtle semantic shifts that occur in financial narratives and that can convey important information to market stakeholders. These are: intensified sentiment, elaborated details, plan realization, and emerging situations. 

3) It proposes a novel pipeline to address the Financial-STS task, which involves: (a) using large language models to generate an augmented dataset containing financial narrative pairs with controlled types and degrees of semantic shifts; (b) training a triplet network on this augmented dataset to differentiate subtle semantic shifts from no shifts.  

4) It introduces two new datasets - an LLM-augmented dataset for training, and a human-annotated dataset for evaluation, which will be made publicly available. Experiments demonstrate superior performance over existing methods.

In summary, this paper establishes a new benchmark and baseline for a practical financial NLP task through novel use of data augmentation and model training. The introduced datasets advance research in financial NLP.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Financial-STS task - A financial domain-specific NLP task to measure the nuanced semantic similarity between pairs of financial narratives from a company's financial statements over time.

- Subtle semantic shifts - The paper defines four types of subtle semantic changes in financial narratives that could convey important information: intensified sentiment, elaborated details, plan realization, and emerging situations. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper uses LLMs such as ChatGPT and Llama to generate augmented financial narrative pairs exhibiting different types of semantic shifts.

- Triplet network - A classic triplet network is trained on the LLM-augmented dataset to differentiate between financial narrative pairs with and without semantic shifts.

- FinSTS dataset - Includes an LLM-augmented dataset and a manually annotated evaluation dataset of financial narrative pairs.

- Financial NLP - Applying NLP methods and models for financial applications, an emerging research area. The paper introduces a new financial NLP benchmark.

In summary, the key focus is on using LLMs for a novel financial semantic textual similarity task to detect subtle shifts between superficially similar financial narratives.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to generate an augmented dataset with examples exhibiting different types of semantic shifts. What are some potential challenges or limitations in relying on LLMs to generate high-quality and nuanced financial sentence pairs?

2. The paper identifies 4 main types of subtle semantic shifts that are relevant for financial narratives. Could there be additional categories of shifts that might provide useful signals? What process could be used to identify other informative types of shifts?  

3. The prompts designed for the LLMs focus specifically on shifts conveying negative financial signals. However, positive shifts also occur. How could the prompt formulation be extended to generate examples exhibiting positive semantic shifts?

4. The paper employs a classic triplet network architecture for the proposed model. What are some recent advances in metric learning and similarity learning that could potentially improve performance on the Financial-STS task?

5. The evaluation relies heavily on human judgement to annotate sentence pairs. This can be resource intensive. What are some ideas to scale up annotation or incorporate weak supervision signals?

6. The paper examines semantic shifts at the sentence level. However, shifts also happen at the discourse or document level. How could the proposed approach be adapted to capture document-level semantic shifts? 

7. The data augmentation process uses GPT-3.5-turbo and Llama-13B. How would performance differ using more recent, larger language models? What metrics could be used to compare the quality of generated data?

8. What are some potential challenges in deploying the proposed semantic similarity model in a production environment for financial applications? How could the model output be interpreted and operationalized? 

9. The paper focuses exclusively on annual reports. How well would the approach generalize to other financial statement sources such as earnings calls, investor presentations, or social media posts?

10. Financial narratives exhibit geographic variation based on company headquarters. How could the model account for subtle differences in financial language use across different countries and languages?
