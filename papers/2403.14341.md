# [Beyond Surface Similarity: Detecting Subtle Semantic Shifts in Financial   Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14341)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper introduces a new NLP task called Financial-STS, which aims to measure the subtle semantic shifts between pairs of financial narratives from a company's financial statements over time (e.g year-over-year). 
- Detecting these subtle shifts is important for financial decision making, but existing semantic textual similarity (STS) methods and pretrained embeddings fail to capture them adequately.

Proposed Method:
- The authors identify 4 types of subtle semantic shifts that are important - intensified sentiment, elaborated details, plan realization, and emerging situations.  
- They prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate augmented financial sentence pairs exhibiting those semantic shifts.
- This augmented dataset is used to train a triplet network to differentiate sentence pairs with vs without semantic shifts.

Main Contributions:  
- Introduction of Financial-STS, a new financial NLP task focused on detecting subtle semantic shifts in paired financial narratives over time.
- A comprehensive pipeline using LLM prompting and triplet network training to effectively discern those shifts.
- Release of FinSTS, a financial semantic similarity dataset with both LLM-augmented and human-annotated subsets.
- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms existing STS methods and LLM embeddings in capturing nuanced financial narrative shifts.

In summary, the paper presents a novel method and dataset to address the challenging and significant problem of understanding subtle changes in financial narratives, which has potential value for financial analysis.
