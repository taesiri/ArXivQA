# [LoraRetriever: Input-Aware LoRA Retrieval and Composition for Mixed   Tasks in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09997)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) benefit from parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) which are modular and plug-and-play. However, existing works utilize multiple LoRAs by either focusing on isolated downstream tasks or fixing LoRA selection during training. 
- This fails to address real-world scenarios where LLMs receive diverse prompts covering different tasks and the candidate LoRAs pool is dynamically updated.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LoraRetriever, a retrieve-then-compose framework to adaptively retrieve and compose LoRAs tailored to input prompts in mixed-task scenarios.

Key Components:
1) Input-aware LoRA Retrieval: Retrieves relevant LoRAs using sentence embeddings refined by instruction fine-tuning for effective generalization.

2) LoRA Composition: Employs two strategies - Fusion (averages parameters of retrieved LoRAs) and Mixture (averages outputs of each LoRA's submodules).

3) Efficient Batch Inference: Constructs a unique mapping matrix to activate corresponding LoRAs for each sample, allowing batched processing.

Main Contributions:  
- Proposes a flexible framework to leverage multiple LoRAs in dynamic mixed-task scenarios through adaptive retrieval and composition.
- Achieves robust generalization capability where retriever is trained on 40% tasks yet effectively handles unseen tasks.
- Enables tailored and efficient batch processing of heterogeneous requests.
- Outperforms baselines on mixed-task evaluation, proving effectiveness and versatility.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the key points! I'm happy to provide more details.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LoraRetriever, a framework to retrieve and compose multiple Low-Rank Adaptations according to heterogeneous input prompts in mixed-task scenarios, through input-aware retrieval, flexible composition strategies, and efficient batch inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called LoraRetriever for serving multiple Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) in mixed-task scenarios. Specifically, the key components and contributions include:

1) An input-aware LoRA retrieval module that can identify and retrieve the most relevant LoRAs from a pool based on the input text. This allows flexible and adaptive selection of LoRAs instead of fixing them apriori.

2) LoRA composition strategies like fusion and mixture that can effectively integrate the retrieved LoRAs into the base LLM to enhance its capabilities. 

3) An efficient batch inference mechanism to enable heterogeneous batch requests and personalized service at scale. 

4) Experimental evaluation on a spectrum of NLU and NLG tasks that demonstrates the effectiveness of LoraRetriever for in-domain and out-of-domain generalizability compared to previous expert routing methods like MoE or adapter fusion techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is an end-to-end framework for input-aware retrieval and integration of multiple LoRAs in a dynamic and mixed-task setting, along with batch inference support.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): A parameter-efficient method for adapting and specializing large language models to new tasks/domains by only updating a small number of additional trainable parameters. Allows for modular and plug-and-play enhancements.

- Mixture of Experts (MoE): A method that combines specialized sub-modules, guided by a gating module, to provide tailored responses based on the input. Used in conjunction with LoRAs for routing and coordinating different experts.

- Retrieve-then-compose framework: The proposed LoraRetriever system works by first retrieving relevant LoRAs based on the input text, then strategically combining/composing the retrieved LoRAs to handle the input.

- Input-aware LoRA retrieval: Identifying and retrieving LoRAs that are specialized for the particular input text, using sentence embeddings fine-tuned with an instruction based method.

- LoRA composition strategies: Strategies proposed like "fusion" and "mixture" to effectively integrate the retrieved LoRAs into the base LLM in the compose stage.

- Batch inference: An efficient batch inference strategy to handle batched and heterogeneous requests, constructing a LoRA mapping matrix.

- Mixed-task scenario: The main focus of the work - real-world scenario with diverse user inputs covering different domains/tasks, requiring coordination of multiple available LoRA experts.

The key innovation is the flexible retrieve-then-compose framework to leverage multiple LoRAs in a mixed-task setting based on the input.
