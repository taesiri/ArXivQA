# [GRAM: Global Reasoning for Multi-Page VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Document visual question answering (DocVQA) models have focused on single-page documents, but real-world documents often span hundreds of pages. 
- Processing long sequences is challenging for transformers due to quadratic scaling of self-attention.
- Existing approaches for long sequences either modify attention or embeddings, but don't translate well to multi-page documents which have both text and images.

Proposed Solution:
- GRAM extends single-page DocVQA models to multi-page documents without needing expensive pretraining. 
- Introduces document-level learnable tokens that enable information flow across pages.
- Proposes a two-stage encoder with page-level layers from single-page model and new document-level layers just for doc tokens.
- Includes bias adaptation to enforce model to utilize new doc tokens.
- Optionally uses a Compression Transformer to reduce sequence length before decoding to improve efficiency.

Main Contributions:
- Method to upgrade single-page DocVQA models to multi-page without pretraining.
- Document-level tokens and bias adaptation for cross-page reasoning.
- Two-stage encoder architecture balancing local page understanding and global document reasoning.
- Compression Transformer allowing tradeoff between accuracy and latency.
- State-of-the-art results on multi-page DocVQA datasets MPDocVQA and DUDE.

In summary, GRAM introduces an efficient way to extend single-page DocVQA models to multi-page documents through document-level tokens, a two-stage encoder, and optional compression before decoding. It achieves new state-of-the-art results for multi-page document understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 GRAM extends single-page document models to efficiently handle multi-page documents through global-local reasoning and an optional compression module for performance-latency tradeoffs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GRAM, a novel approach for extending existing single-page document models to efficiently handle multi-page documents without needing additional pretraining. Key aspects of GRAM include:

1) Introducing document-level learnable tokens and designated layers to enable information flow across pages for global reasoning, while still leveraging a single-page encoder for local page understanding. 

2) A tailored bias adaptation method to enforce the model to utilize the newly introduced document-level tokens.

3) An optional compression stage using a Compression Transformer (C-Former) model to reduce encoded sequence length and allow a tradeoff between quality and latency during decoding.

4) Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-page DocVQA benchmarks like MPDocVQA and DUDE, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

In summary, the main contribution is developing an efficient way to endow multi-page capabilities to single-page DocVQA models without needing expensive pretraining, through document-level tokens, bias adaptation, and optional compression.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces document-level learnable tokens to enable information flow across pages. How are these tokens initialized and what mechanisms allow them to capture cross-page context? Can you suggest other initialization strategies that may work better?

2. The global-local encoder blocks alternate between page-level and document-level reasoning. What are the advantages of this interleaved design over doing global reasoning less frequently, such as only after all local page encoding?

3. The bias adaptation method applies a decaying bias to the attention heads for attending to global tokens. What is the intuition behind making this bias value differ across heads? How sensitive is model performance to the exact bias values used?

4. The C-Former module compresses the encoded document representations before decoding. What are some ways this compression could negatively impact answer quality, especially for questions requiring cross-page reasoning? How might the compression be improved?

5. Could the global-local encoder structure proposed here be combined with other recent innovations in document understanding models, such as 2D positional embeddings or visual-textual co-attention? What benefits might this provide?

6. The ablation study examines the impact of factors like number of global tokens, bias type, and compression length. What other architectural choices could be ablated to better understand their contributions?

7. How well does the model handle documents with complex layouts like figures, tables, diagrams etc that span multiple pages? What extensions could handle these cases better? 

8. Could the model be improved by incorporating hierarchical information, clustering pages into sections or chapters rather than a flat page sequence? How would this impact the global reasoning?

9. How does the quadratic dependence on page count compare between this model versus simply encoding the full document as one sequence? When would each approach be preferred?

10. The model achieves strong results but is still imperfect, for example struggling with highly abstractive questions. What innovations could better handle these open-ended cases requiring more complex reasoning?
