## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the use of federated learning for retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) image classification, in order to enable collaboration between medical institutions without compromising privacy. The key problem is that medical data like OCT images are sensitive and cannot be freely shared across institutions due to privacy concerns. However, the performance of AI models benefits from larger and more diverse training data. 

The paper proposes using federated learning, where models are trained on decentralized data located on multiple clients (representing institutions), without directly accessing the raw data. Specifically, two methods are evaluated - FedAvg and FedProx. The clients train local models on their private data, only sharing model updates with a central server, which aggregates the updates into an improved global model.

The methods are evaluated on a public OCT image dataset partitioned across 10 clients. Experiments are conducted under IID (identically distributed) and non-IID (statistically heterogeneous) splits of the data. It is shown that both methods perform on par with centralized training under IID splits. However, performance declines under non-IID splits where certain clients lack examples of some classes. Notably, FedProx demonstrates more robustness than FedAvg in high heterogeneity settings.

The key contributions are: (1) Investigation of federated learning for OCT classification under heterogeneous distributions and multiple clients; (2) Comparative evaluation of FedAvg and FedProx under varying statistical heterogeneity; (3) Demonstration that federated learning can enable privacy-preserving collaboration, but performance declines with increased heterogeneity, necessitating more advanced algorithms. The results provide insights into the feasibility of decentralized training for medical applications.
