## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this survey paper on fairness in large language models compares to other related work:

- Scope - This paper provides a broad overview of fairness research on both medium-scale and large-scale language models. Many existing surveys focus only on bias mitigation for medium-scale models like BERT. Covering fairness issues in large models like GPT-3 and LLaMA is valuable given their rapid development.

- Structure - The paper systematically categorizes the evaluation metrics, reasons for bias, and debiasing methods based on model scale and training paradigm. This provides a clear framework for organizing the wide range of existing research. Similar surveys often lack this level of structure.

- Comprehensiveness - The paper summarizes a large number of recent studies on fairness evaluation and mitigation strategies for both intrinsic and extrinsic bias. It covers the major developments in this quickly evolving field. Other surveys can become outdated more quickly by missing important new work.

- Insights - The discussion section provides thoughtful analysis of current challenges and future directions. The authors offer their own perspectives on issues like metric reliability, evaluation methods for large models, understanding model biases, and debiasing techniques. This higher-level commentary is lacking in some existing surveys.

- Timeliness - This survey captures very recent research on analyzing and mitigating biases in models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. Staying up-to-date is crucial given the fast pace of advances in large language models.

Overall, the comprehensive and structured overview of both medium-scale and large-scale model fairness, along with insightful discussion of current limitations and open problems, makes this an excellent reference compared to existing surveys focused only on bias mitigation methods or intrinsic evaluation. The paper moves the field forward by identifying promising research directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions for improving fairness in large language models:

1. Develop more reliable correlations between intrinsic and extrinsic bias metrics. The authors note that intrinsic and extrinsic biases are not necessarily correlated, so more work is needed on extrinsic metrics focused on downstream tasks. They suggest creating new challenge sets and annotated test data to make the metrics more robust.

2. Expand methods for accurately evaluating fairness in large-scale LLMs. The authors recommend applying more statistical and automated techniques to quantify bias, and developing more diverse and comprehensive benchmark datasets tailored to large models. 

3. Further explore reasons for bias from different perspectives beyond just data statistics, such as psychological, political, and model architecture factors. 

4. Improve debiasing strategies for large models, such as more efficient and generalizable prompt engineering methods. The authors also suggest considering fairness during model development through better data processing and model architectures.

In summary, the main future directions are: strengthening evaluation metrics, especially for large models; digging deeper into bias sources; and improving debiasing techniques to be more efficient, scalable, and integrated earlier into model development. The overarching goal is developing more comprehensive understandings of bias and mitigation strategies to build safer and fairer LLMs.

 The paper is a survey on fairness in large language models (LLMs). It first discusses medium-scale LLMs under the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. It introduces evaluation metrics for fairness, including intrinsic metrics like SEAT and extrinsic metrics like coreference resolution. It then summarizes debiasing methods for medium-scale LLMs, including pre-processing methods like counterfactual data augmentation, in-processing methods like disentanglement, and post-processing methods like projection. The paper then shifts focus to large-scale LLMs like GPT-3 under the prompting paradigm. It summarizes recent work on evaluating, understanding, and mitigating bias in large LLMs. Evaluation methods leverage tasks like prompt completion and dialogue to quantify bias. Reasons for bias are linked to training data imbalances. Debiasing methods include instructional fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Finally, the paper discusses challenges and future directions, like developing more reliable evaluation metrics, diverse benchmarks, and efficient debiasing strategies for large LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two-paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of research related to fairness in large language models (LLMs). The authors first discuss fairness issues in medium-scale LLMs that follow a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. They introduce metrics for evaluating intrinsic bias in embeddings and extrinsic bias in downstream tasks. They also summarize debiasing methods, including data processing techniques like counterfactual data augmentation, model modifications like disentanglement and alignment constraints, and post-processing methods like projection and contrastive learning. 

The authors then discuss recent work related to the fairness of large-scale LLMs that follow a prompting paradigm, where models are prompted to generate text. They summarize methods for evaluating fairness by analyzing model outputs, reasons for bias like imbalanced training data, and debiasing techniques like instruction fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Finally, the authors discuss challenges and future directions, such as better correlating intrinsic and extrinsic metrics, developing more evaluation datasets, further exploring reasons for bias, improving debiasing efficiency, and considering fairness during model development. Overall, this paper provides a thorough overview of fairness research for LLMs and highlights areas needing more work.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for debiasing large language models (LLMs) based on instruction fine-tuning and prompt engineering. For instruction fine-tuning, the authors leverage reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to collect human demonstrations and train reward models that can guide an LLM like GPT-3 or LLaMA-2 to generate less biased and safer outputs. The fine-tuned models such as InstructGPT and LLaMA-2-chat are shown to exhibit significantly reduced toxicity and stereotype bias compared to the original models. For prompt engineering, the authors demonstrate that carefully designing prompts can steer LLMs like GPT-4 away from biased responses without any fine-tuning. For example, adding the phrase "in an inclusive way" to a prompt can make GPT-4 generate less gender-biased text. Overall, this work shows that large-scale LLMs can be partially debiased through targeted human feedback and prompts, paving the way for developing safer and fairer LLMs. The combination of instruction tuning and prompt design provides an efficient and customizable framework for mitigating biases in large pretrained models.

 Based on my reading, this paper is providing a survey and review of research related to fairness in large language models (LLMs). The key problems and questions it is addressing include:

- How to evaluate fairness in LLMs, both for medium-scale models (like BERT) and large-scale models (like GPT-3). It summarizes metrics for evaluating intrinsic bias in embeddings and extrinsic bias in model predictions.
