# [Exploring 3D-aware Latent Spaces for Efficiently Learning Numerous   Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11678)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of efficiently learning a large number of 3D scenes from images, which is important for applications like commerce, virtual reality, etc. However, existing neural scene representations like NeRF have high rendering cost and do not scale well to numerous scenes. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two main ideas to improve efficiency:

1. Learn a 3D-aware latent space using a novel 3D-aware autoencoder (3Da-AE). This compresses images while preserving 3D consistency. Scene representations can then be trained in this space, drastically reducing rendering and training cost.

2. Introduce a Micro-Macro decomposition of scene representations. Each scene uses both globally shared representations to capture common information across scenes (reduces redundancy), as well as local representations to capture scene-specific details. This reduces per-scene optimization cost.

Together, training in the 3D latent space and Micro-Macro decomposition minimize compute and memory needed per scene.

Contributions:

- Novel 3Da-AE to learn a 3D-consistent latent space for accelerated volume rendering 

- Micro-Macro decomposition of scene representations for cross-scene information sharing

- Demonstrate method trains 1000 scenes with 86% less time per scene and 44% less memory, with no loss of quality

- Propose a solution orthogonal to the time-memory tradeoff in existing works, improving both simultaneously

The method represents an important step towards scaling neural scene representations to numerous scenes, unlocking new applications.
