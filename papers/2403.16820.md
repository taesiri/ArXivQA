# [Cross-lingual Contextualized Phrase Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16820)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Phrase-level dense retrieval has shown promise for improving performance in downstream NLP tasks by providing more fine-grained information than sentences. However, prior work has focused mainly on English phrases or cross-lingual retrieval of wiki entities, which are limited in utility.
- There is a lack of models and training data for the task of general cross-lingual contextualized phrase retrieval, which aims to find relevant phrase translations while accounting for polysemy using context information. This is an important capability for augmenting cross-lingual NLP applications.

Proposed Solution:
- Automatically extract cross-lingual phrase pairs from parallel sentences using word alignment information. This allows collection of general phrase pairs along with their aligned source and target contexts.
- Propose a Cross-lingual Contextualized Phrase Retriever (CCPR) model trained using contrastive learning on the extracted phrase pairs to encourage alignment of representations for phrases with similar semantics and contexts.
- CCPR contains a phrase alignment module for retrieval and a phrase segmentation module for selecting meaningful phrases from sentences at inference time.

Main Contributions:
- Formulate a new cross-lingual contextualized phrase retrieval task to address polysemy and provide finer-grained cross-lingual information.
- Method for automatic construction of cross-lingual contextualized phrase pair training data using word alignment on parallel sentences.
- Introduction of the CCPR model architecture specialized for cross-lingual contextualized phrase retrieval through contrastive pre-training.
- Demonstration of CCPR's effectiveness via comprehensive experiments showing significant gains over baselines on retrieval accuracy and machine translation quality.

In summary, the paper introduces an important new capability of cross-lingual contextualized phrase retrieval and provides innovations in model design and training data creation to effectively solve this task. Experiments confirm the utility of this approach for improving cross-lingual NLP applications.
