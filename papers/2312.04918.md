# [Pruning Convolutional Filters via Reinforcement Learning with Entropy   Minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04918)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for neural network pruning using an information-theoretic reward function within an automated machine learning (AutoML) framework. Specifically, instead of directly maximizing accuracy as the reward signal for a reinforcement learning agent that determines the sparsity levels per layer, the authors minimize the spatial entropy of convolutional activations. Through experiments on VGG-16, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50 models trained on CIFAR-10, they empirically demonstrate that minimizing spatial entropy acts as an effective proxy for maintaining accuracy during aggressive pruning. For example, pruning VGG-16 to only 10% of its original FLOPS incurred less than 1% accuracy drop, similar to directly optimizing for accuracy, despite entropy and accuracy being unrelated objectives. This establishes an interesting connection between information theory and neural network pruning, suggesting redundancy reduction via entropy minimization preserves representation quality. Over multiple architectures and FLOPS targets, their approach matches or exceeds the performance of prevailing accuracy-driven pruning techniques. The method contributes a principled, non-accuracy based perspective to structural pruning focused on information content.
