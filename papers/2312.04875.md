# [MVDD: Multi-View Depth Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04875)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors propose a novel Multi-View Depth Diffusion model (MVDD) for scalable and high-fidelity 3D shape generation. MVDD represents 3D shapes using multi-view depth maps and leverages recent advances in 2D diffusion models to effectively generate realistic and diverse depth maps. To enforce consistency across views, the model incorporates two key components: an epipolar "line segment" attention mechanism that efficiently attends to relevant features from neighboring views during denoising, and a depth fusion module that explicitly aligns the generated depth maps. Through extensive experiments on ShapeNet, MVDD demonstrates superior performance in tasks like unconditional shape generation, depth completion, and serving as a 3D prior to boost downstream applications. The multi-view depth representation allows MVDD to generate dense point clouds with 20K+ points and fine details. Both qualitative results and quantitative evaluations across several metrics showcase MVDD's state-of-the-art capabilities in producing high-quality and diverse 3D shapes compared to other diffusion-based and GAN-based models.
