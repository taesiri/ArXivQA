# [Data Quality Matters: Suicide Intention Detection on Social Media Posts   Using a RoBERTa-CNN Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Suicide is a major global health concern that requires early detection and intervention. Linguistic symptoms in writing/speech can indicate suicide risk. 
- Social media provides an abundant source of linguistic data to analyze for suicide ideation detection (SID).

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors develop a RoBERTa-CNN model for SID on social media text data.
- RoBERTa is a pre-trained language model good at capturing textual nuances. The CNN component enhances feature extraction.
- The model is tested on the Suicide and Depression Detection (SDD) Reddit dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Achieved 98% accuracy for suicide intention detection on SDD, outperforming prior benchmarks.
- Determined optimal text sequence length (256 tokens) for the dataset through ablation studies.  
- Showed the importance of high-quality data cleaning - used GPT to clean a portion of SDD data.
- The proposed RoBERTa-CNN model demonstrates strong capabilities for identifying linguistic signs of suicide risk.

In summary, the authors effectively apply a RoBERTa-CNN model to identify suicidal intentions from social media text. Their model achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on a Reddit dataset. The work highlights the importance of high-quality data and presents a promising ML approach to improve early detection of suicide risk.
