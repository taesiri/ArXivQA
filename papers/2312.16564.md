# [Balancing Priorities in Patrolling with Rabbit Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16564)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of patrolling in environments that have locations of varying priority. While it is important to visit the high priority locations frequently, the non-priority locations also need to be patrolled to avoid breaches in security. The key challenge is to balance the visits between priority and non-priority locations.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a distributed online algorithm that assigns patrol routes (called "rabbit walks") to robots to ensure finite time visits to non-priority locations while prioritizing visits to high priority locations. The key ideas are:

1) Rabbit Walks: Routes between two priority locations that have 3 hops - first hop explores non-priority locations, next two hops are shortest paths. The number of walks scales exponentially with a tunable parameter H.

2) Online Assignment: At runtime, subset of precomputed walks are selected using four strategies - exhaustive, sampled, random or greedy based on idleness. A walk with max cumulative idleness is assigned.

Main Contributions:

1) A resource-aware route generation method that generates a configurable number of walks for exploration. Enables patrolling within robot's memory constraints.

2) Four variant algorithms for online route assignment that balance visits between priority and non-priority locations. Ensure finite time visits to all locations. 

3) Extensive simulations and experiments that validate the performance of algorithms. PPA-Greedy found to have best tradeoff in terms of priority vs overall idleness.

4) Comparisons to existing method show the strengths of proposed approach in balancing priorities with limited resources. Applicable to variety of patrolling needs from inspection to surveillance.
