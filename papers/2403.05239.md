# [Towards Effective Usage of Human-Centric Priors in Diffusion Models for   Text-based Human Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle to generate accurate and high-quality human images from text prompts alone. They often result in distorted limbs, disproportional bodies, and unnatural postures. Prior methods rely on extra inputs like pose maps during inference, complicating the generation process. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a simple yet effective human-centric prior (HcP) layer to enhance human image generation without needing extra conditions at inference time. The key ideas are:

(1) Analyze cross-attention maps which relate text tokens to image regions, finding human-related tokens strongly influence body structure. Insufficient cross-attention capabilities cause human image quality issues. 

(2) Introduce the HcP layer to selectively strengthen human-centric token attention during model fine-tuning. This aligns cross-attention maps with human pose reference features using a human-centric alignment loss.

(3) Adopt a scale and step aware training strategy based on analysis showing early timesteps determine human structure while later refine details, and different UNet scales impact structure formation.

Contributions:
- Propose HcP layer to inject human pose information into diffusion models via cross-attention maps, improving human image quality without extra conditions at inference.

- Demonstrate HcP layer fixes distortions in complex prompts while retaining original model's quality and diversity.

- Achieve state-of-the-art text-based human image synthesis, outperforming prior fine-tuning and conditional methods in quality and text-image consistency.

- Show HcP layer generalizes to controllable generation models, further boosting output quality.

In summary, this paper significantly advances text-based human image generation through a simple yet effective module that strategically integrates human pose information within diffusion models via cross-attention manipulation.
