# [Prometheus: Inducing Fine-grained Evaluation Capability in Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08491)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we obtain an open-source language model that possesses evaluation capabilities on par with proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 for customized, fine-grained text evaluation?

The key points are:

- The paper focuses on obtaining an open-source LLM evaluator, as opposed to relying solely on proprietary models like GPT-4 which have drawbacks like being closed-source, costly, and having uncontrolled versioning.

- The goal is to match GPT-4's capabilities in providing fine-grained, customized text evaluation based on user-defined criteria. This is in contrast to prior evaluators trained on generic notions of preference. 

- The paper hypothesizes that by enriching smaller models with robust reference materials (like scoring rubrics and reference answers) and fine-tuning on customized feedback, they can induce strong evaluation capabilities.

So in summary, the central research question is how to create an open-source LLM that can perform fine-grained text evaluation tailored to diverse user criteria as effectively as proprietary models like GPT-4. The paper explores whether this is achievable by careful dataset design and training methodology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a new dataset called the Feedback Collection for training an evaluator language model. The key aspects of this dataset are:

- It contains 1K fine-grained, customized scoring rubrics that represent diverse, real-world evaluation criteria beyond just generic notions of preference or helpfulness. 

- It includes reference materials like scoring rubrics and reference answers that provide crucial context to aid the model's evaluation capabilities. 

- It comprises 100K instances with detailed feedback and scores provided by GPT-4 on sample responses.

2. Using the Feedback Collection to train Prometheus, an open-source 13B evaluator language model. Key results:

- Prometheus achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.897 with human scorers, on par with GPT-4's correlation of 0.882. This demonstrates its ability to closely simulate human evaluation.

- In a pairwise comparison, human evaluators preferred Prometheus's feedback over GPT-4's 58.6% of the time. This validates the meaningfulness of its feedback.

- Prometheus obtains strong correlation with GPT-4 scoring across several test sets, outperforming baselines like GPT-3.5 and untrained Llama-2.

- Prometheus shows promise as a general reward model, outperforming other models on unseen human preference datasets. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate that:

- Fine-tuning on feedback and supplying reference materials are key to inducing strong evaluation skills, even in smaller models.

- Evaluation precision improves with more granular, customized rubrics versus coarse notions of preference. 

- Open-source models can reach proprietary model performance given sufficient data/tuning.

Overall, the paper makes a compelling case for training customized evaluator models using diverse human feedback, an underexplored idea. The proposed dataset and model offer useful tools for the community.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions the authors suggest:

1. Exploring different base models for training evaluator LMs specialized on different domains (e.g. code, math): The authors find that using Code-Llama as a starting point provides benefits when evaluating code responses. They suggest exploring training evaluator LMs specialized for different domains by choosing domain-specific base models. 

2. Training on additional types of reference materials: The authors show the importance of reference materials like score rubric and reference answers. They suggest exploring effects of including other reference inputs like "Score 1 Reference Answer" or "Background Knowledge".

3. Using the trained evaluator LM as a reward model for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): The authors find their model trained on absolute grading generalizes to ranking tasks. This suggests it could be used as a reward model for RLHF, which they recommend exploring further.

4. Preparing customized feedback datasets for training: The authors find directly training on target feedback data obtains the best task-specific performance. They provide guidelines for creating customized feedback datasets to train evaluator LMs.

5. Testing on more adversarial examples: The authors point out their test responses did not include adversarial cases to expose length bias. They suggest more extensive testing on adversarial data.

6. Embedding evaluation capabilities into smaller LMs: The authors show increasing fine-grained evaluation and adding reference materials can enable smaller LMs to evaluate well. They recommend further exploration of how small an LM can be while still evaluating effectively.

In summary, key directions are exploring specialized domain models, adding more reference materials, using the model for RLHF, creating custom feedback datasets, testing on adversarial data, and pushing evaluation capabilities into smaller LMs. The authors provide an initial investigation to enable further research on these fronts.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper explores using smaller open source language models as evaluators for assessing the quality of text generated by large language models. The authors argue that large proprietary models like GPT-4, while effective, have downsides like being closed source, having unpredictable version changes, and being expensive to use at scale. Thus, they investigate training smaller open source models to act as effective evaluators.

The authors create a new feedback dataset called Feedback Collection for training evaluator models. It contains fine-grained customized rubrics, instructions, responses, and feedback generated by GPT-4. They use this to train an evaluator model called Prometheus based on the open source Llama-2-Chat model. Through extensive experiments, they show Prometheus correlates highly with human evaluation and outperforms baselines like GPT-3.5-Turbo. This demonstrates that with proper training and the right kind of data, smaller open source models can approach proprietary models in evaluation capabilities. The work provides both a useful model and insights into training more accurate open source evaluators.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new dataset called the Feedback Collection for training language models to function as evaluators of long-form text. The Feedback Collection contains customized scoring rubrics, instructions, reference answers, responses, and detailed feedback generated by GPT-4 for each response. The authors use this dataset to fine-tune the Llama-2-Chat language model into an evaluator model called Prometheus. Specifically, Prometheus is trained using causal language modeling to generate feedback and scores for responses based on the given scoring rubric and reference answer. The loss is propagated only to the feedback and score generation components to focus the model on evaluation. Prometheus is evaluated by measuring its correlation with human scores and GPT-4 judgments across several test sets, as well as on human preference ranking datasets. The results show that Prometheus approaches GPT-4 performance when provided with scoring rubrics and reference answers, demonstrating the potential for training open-source models as customized evaluators.
