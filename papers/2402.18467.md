# [Separate and Conquer: Decoupling Co-occurrence via Decomposition and   Representation for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18467)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) uses only image-level labels which is challenging as it leads to false activation of pixels due to frequent co-occurrence of objects in images. For example, boat and water often appear together in images causing networks to falsely activate water pixels when predicting boats. 

- Existing WSSS methods fail to tackle this co-occurrence issue properly and rely on external supervision or human priors which limits real-world applicability.

Solution - "Separate and Conquer" Scheme:

- The key insight is to separate co-occurring objects initially and then enhance semantic representations to conquer false activations. This is done without any external supervision.

- Separate co-occurring objects using image decomposition into patches. Assign each patch a category tag using Class Activation Maps (CAMs). Rectify noisy tags using tag memory pool.

- Conquer false activations by dual-teacher single-student architecture. Global teacher provides category knowledge from images acting as centroids during patch representation to push apart co-categories. Local teacher maintains patch semantic reservoir guided by tag memory pool to reduce noise.

- Multi-granularity contrast performed across dataset using category knowledge and patch semantics to deeply decouple co-occurring contexts.

Main Contributions:

- Novel separate and conquer scheme to tackle co-occurrence in WSSS without external supervision

- Image decomposition with category tag assignment to patches to remove spatial dependence of co-occurrence

- Dual-teacher single-student framework for multi-granularity contrastive representation

- State-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Significantly outperforms previous methods in tackling co-occurrence.
