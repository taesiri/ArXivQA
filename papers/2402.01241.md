# [Can Shape-Infused Joint Embeddings Improve Image-Conditioned 3D   Diffusion?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01241)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in text-to-image generation using CLIP embeddings to guide diffusion models have shown impressive results. However, CLIP only sees 2D image features during training, lacking explicit 3D structural information. 
- Using CLIP to guide 3D shape generation may lead to losing fine-grained 3D details not captured in 2D images, causing generated shapes to lack coherence with input images.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce CISP, a contrastive image-shape pre-training model, to align 2D images and 3D shapes in a joint embedding space.
- CISP is designed to capture 3D characteristics in the embeddings that may be overlooked by CLIP's text-image focus.
- Build an image-conditioned 3D shape generation pipeline with a diffusion model that can use either CLIP or CISP embeddings as guidance.

Main Contributions:
- Show that a CISP-guided diffusion model generates 3D shapes with higher coherence to input images than a CLIP-guided model, while maintaining similar quality and diversity.
- Demonstrate the impact of incorporating explicit 3D knowledge into the guiding process through the improved coherence.
- Prove robust generalization of CISP to out-of-distribution data despite smaller-scale pre-training compared to CLIP.
- Suggest that investing in large-scale multimodal systems with 3D representations could significantly advance 3D visual content synthesis capabilities.

In summary, this work introduces a way to integrate 3D information into the conditioning process for generating 3D shapes, and shows quantitative and qualitative improvements over using only 2D image embeddings, highlighting promising research directions in this area.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel contrastive image-shape pre-training model (CISP) designed to align images and 3D shapes in a joint embedding space and shows that using CISP to guide a 3D diffusion model generates shapes with higher coherence to input images compared to using CLIP guidance, while maintaining similar quality and diversity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of CISP, a model exploiting contrastive pre-training to learn joint image-shape embeddings. 

2. Showing that a CISP-conditioned diffusion model generates shapes with higher coherence to the guiding images than a CLIP-conditioned model, while maintaining similar generation quality and diversity. This is despite CLIP being large-scale compared to CISP.

3. Investigating the impact of shape-aware embeddings by studying the regularity of the CISP embedding space with manifold interpolations and out-of-distribution sampling.

In summary, the paper presents CISP for aligning images and shapes in a joint embedding space, and shows it can improve the coherence between generated 3D shapes and conditioning images compared to using CLIP embeddings, even though CLIP is trained on much more data. The paper also analyzes properties of the CISP embedding space.

The paper introduces a new model called CISP that learns joint embeddings between 2D images and 3D shapes in order to improve image-conditioned 3D shape generation using diffusion models. It compares CISP to CLIP embeddings for guiding a 3D diffusion model, evaluating the quality, diversity and coherence of generated shapes. The key terms reflect this focus on 3D generation, joint embeddings, diffusion models, and assessing multimodal conditioning spaces.
