# [Towards the Detection of AI-Synthesized Human Face Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08750)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of detecting entirely AI-synthesized human face images. With the rapid development of generative models like GANs and diffusion models (DMs), it has become increasingly easy to generate highly realistic fake human face images. However, existing fake image detectors struggle to generalize across face images created by different models. Evaluating generalization ability and robustness against perturbations are still open issues.

Solution:
The paper contributes a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating synthetic face image detectors. The benchmark comprises real CelebA-HQ images and fake images from 3 GANs (ProGAN, StyleGAN2, VQGAN) and 4 DMs (DDPM, DDIM, PNDM, LDM). It evaluates both generalization ability of detectors across models and robustness against perturbations like compression, blur, noise and resizing. 

The paper analyzes frequency artifacts of fake face images and shows they deviate from real images. Leveraging this, the paper trains CNN classifiers on frequency representations of images and demonstrates superior generalization ability compared to training on RGB images.

Main Contributions:

- Creation of a comprehensive benchmark with real and fake face images from multiple state-of-the-art models to assess generalization and robustness of detectors

- Analysis of frequency artifacts in fake face images showing deviations from real image spectra

- Demonstration that training detectors on frequency representations significantly improves generalization ability across unseen models compared to detectors trained on RGB images

- Evaluation of different pre-trained detectors on the benchmark revealing most struggle to generalize to fake face images

- Assessment of robustness of detectors under common perturbations, with analysis showing robustness remains a key challenge
