# [RePaint: Inpainting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09865)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we develop an image inpainting method using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) that is able to handle diverse and extreme inpainting masks while generating high-quality and semantically meaningful completions?

The key points are:

- Image inpainting aims to fill in missing or masked regions in images with synthesized content. Most existing approaches train models for specific mask distributions, limiting generalization.

- DDPMs have emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach, but have not been extensively explored for conditional image generation tasks like inpainting. 

- The authors propose a novel way to condition an unconditionally trained DDPM to perform free-form image inpainting for arbitrary masks. Their RePaint method does not require training on masks.

- RePaint introduces a resampling strategy during the DDPM's reverse diffusion process to better harmonize the image and improve coherence.

- Experiments show RePaint generates higher quality and more robust inpaintings compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive and GAN methods, especially for sparse and extreme masks.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that leveraging unconditional DDPMs in a novel conditioning framework can achieve superior performance and generalization for diverse image inpainting masks. The experiments aim to validate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes RePaint, a method for free-form image inpainting using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). The key contributions are:

- Leveraging a pretrained unconditional DDPM as a powerful image prior for inpainting. The DDPM is not trained specifically for inpainting.

- Conditioning the DDPM sampling process on the known pixels by sampling from the conditional distribution in the masked region. This allows using any DDPM for inpainting without modifying the model architecture.

- Introducing a resampling strategy during the reverse diffusion process that repeatedly denoises and diffuses the image. This better harmonizes the generated content with the known pixels.

- Achieving state-of-the-art inpainting results on CelebA-HQ, ImageNet and Places2 datasets for a variety of mask types. The method generalizes very well to different masks compared to GAN and autoregressive baselines.

- Producing high quality and diverse inpainting results by leveraging the strong image prior learned by DDPMs, without being limited by losses used during training as in other approaches.

In summary, the key innovation is using a pretrained DDPM for inpainting by conditioning the sampling process, and introducing a resampling strategy that harmonizes the generated content. This provides a simple yet effective approach for free-form inpainting that generalizes very well to diverse masks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to related work:

- The paper proposes a new approach for image inpainting using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Most prior work on inpainting uses GANs or autoregressive models, so this explores a different generative modeling paradigm.

- Compared to GAN-based inpainting methods, the proposed approach does not require training on a dataset of masks/inpainting pairs. Instead, it leverages a pretrained unconditional DDPM model and conditions it by sampling known pixels during diffusion. This provides greater generalization to novel masks.

- Unlike some recent autoregressive inpainting methods, this approach does not use a specialized architecture or losses for inpainting. The unconditionally trained DDPM brings a strong image prior that enables high-quality completion even for challenging masks covering most of the image.

- The proposed resampling of diffusion steps is a novel way to better harmonize generated content with known regions, improving coherence. This approach differs from prior work on guided diffusion models.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet for both standard and more extreme masks. The approach generalizes better than GAN and autoregressive methods.

- The diffusion process allows sampling diversity in completions. Quantitative analysis shows the generations have both high quality and meaningful diversity for irregular masks.

- A limitation is the per-image optimization is slower than feedforward approaches. However, recent work is improving efficiency of sampling for DDPMs.

In summary, this explores a new direction for inpainting using diffusion models with promising results. The training-free conditioning and resampling strategy innovates over prior diffusion techniques. The approach performs well while providing mask generalization and diversity.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving the efficiency of the per-image optimization process to make it faster and applicable to real-time settings. The current DDPM optimization is slower than GAN and autoregressive approaches.

- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics and procedures for the extreme mask cases where the model generates realistic but different completions from the ground truth image. The authors suggest using FID score computed on a large test set, but this is currently computationally infeasible with DDPMs. 

- Addressing potential biases in the generative model arising from biases in the training data. The authors note the ImageNet model seems biased towards generating dogs.

- Exploring modifications to the training procedure or model architecture to improve semantic coherence and avoid mixing incongruous objects in some cases.

- Applying the approach to higher resolutions beyond 256x256, since the current analysis was limited to that size due to computational constraints.

- Comparing performance on additional mask distributions beyond the ones analyzed.

- Further analysis of the latent space and sampling strategies for the reverse diffusion process.

In summary, the main directions are improving efficiency, better evaluation of extreme masks, addressing training data biases, improving semantic coherence, scaling up the resolution, expanding the mask distributions tested, and further analysis of the diffusion sampling process.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes RePaint, a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based approach for free-form image inpainting. It leverages a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the image prior and conditions it by sampling the known pixels during the reverse diffusion process. This allows it to generalize to arbitrary masks without mask-specific training. Furthermore, it introduces a resampling strategy during diffusion that repeatedly diffuses forward and backward to better harmonize the image. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various masks, with improved generalization over other autoregressive and GAN methods that are trained on specific masks. The approach produces high-quality and diverse outputs by taking advantage of the strong image prior learned by DDPMs. A key advantage is that it does not require modifying or retraining the original unconditional DDPM model for the inpainting task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes RePaint, a novel approach for image inpainting using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Image inpainting aims to fill in missing or masked regions of an image in a realistic way. Most existing methods train models on specific mask distributions, limiting their generalization to new mask types. RePaint leverages a pretrained unconditional DDPM as a powerful image prior, and conditions it by sampling known pixels during the reverse diffusion process. This allows it to naturally handle any mask shape without mask-specific training. 

RePaint introduces a resampling strategy during inference that iteratively denoises, then diffuses the image to better harmonize generated content. This resampled diffusion achieves significantly better results than simply slowing down the reverse diffusion. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet demonstrate RePaint produces more realistic and semantically meaningful completions than state-of-the-art autoregressive and GAN methods, especially for challenging mask types like super-resolution. A user study confirms RePaint generates more realistic images overall. RePaint demonstrates the potential of leveraging unconditional DDPM image priors for conditional image generation tasks like inpainting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

The paper proposes RePaint, an inpainting method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). RePaint leverages a pretrained unconditional DDPM as a generative prior. To perform inpainting, it modifies the reverse diffusion sampling process to condition on the known pixels in the image. Specifically, at each step of the reverse diffusion, it samples the known pixels from the input image and samples the unknown pixels from the DDPM. To improve results, RePaint also introduces a resampling strategy where it jumps back and forth in diffusion time to enable better harmonization between the known and generated pixels. By not modifying the original DDPM and only conditioning the sampling process, RePaint can generalize to arbitrary inpainting masks while leveraging the strong generative capabilities of DDPMs. Experiments show it outperforms GAN and autoregressive models, especially on sparse and large masks. A key advantage is it does not require mask-specific training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes RePaint, a method for inpainting missing regions in images using a pretrained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model, where the known pixels are sampled during the reverse diffusion process to condition the generation without modifying the original model.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper appears to be presenting RePaint, a new approach for image inpainting using denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Image inpainting refers to filling in missing or corrupted parts of an image in a realistic and semantically coherent way. 

The key problems/questions addressed in this paper are:

- Most existing inpainting methods train for specific mask distributions, limiting their generalization to new mask types. This paper aims to develop an approach that can generalize to arbitrary masks.

- Training with pixel-wise and perceptual losses often leads existing methods to produce simple texture extensions rather than semantically meaningful content. This paper wants to leverage the strong generative capabilities of DDPMs to produce more semantic inpainting.

- Standard DDPM sampling can match texture but produce semantically incorrect inpainting. The paper proposes a new resampling strategy during inference to improve conditioning and semantic coherence.

So in summary, the main goals are developing an inpainting method using DDPMs that 1) generalizes to arbitrary masks rather than requiring mask-specific training and 2) produces semantically meaningful inpainting rather than just texture extensions. The key idea is the proposed resampling strategy to better condition the DDPM inference process.

This resampling with jumps allows the model to reconsider decisions and improve harmony. RePaint outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on CelebA-HQ, ImageNet and Places2 across different mask types, especially for thin and sparse masks. The user study indicates it generates more realistic and harmonious results. The method is analyzed in ablation studies showing the impact of components like jump size and number of resamplings. Additional contributions include introducing a new diverse benchmark, analyzing failure cases revealing dataset bias, and providing more insights by visualizing the diffusion process over time. Overall, RePaint advances diffusion models for inpainting by effectively utilizing the latent space with resampling and large jumps. The comprehensive experiments and analyses demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance and robustness.
