# [Wisdom of Committee: Distilling from Foundation Model to Specialized   Application Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Foundation models like BERT and GPT have shown impressive performance across many tasks. However, they are often too large and inefficient for specialized applications. Meanwhile, practitioners have developed custom smaller models optimized for serving specific applications.  
- A natural path is to transfer knowledge from foundation models to specialized application models via distillation. However, there are significant challenges due to large gaps in model capacity, architecture, training data distribution, and input features between foundation and application models.

Proposed Solution
- Create a teaching committee with both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers that are more similar to the student application model. This helps bridge the gap for smoother knowledge transfer.
- Introduce DiverseDistill - an interactive distillation method where the student asks tailored questions to each teacher based on modeling their expertise, and learns from the teachers' answers. This allows handling arbitrary combinations of diverse teachers.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate benefits of using both foundation and complementary teachers compared to using just one type of teacher
- DiverseDistill consistently outperforms baseline distillation methods by allowing the student to understand each teacher's specialty and extract the most useful knowledge
- Show significant student performance improvements on both recommendation and vision tasks using language models, vision models, and specialized application models as teachers

In summary, the paper proposes creating a diverse teaching committee and an interactive student-teacher distillation process to effectively transfer knowledge from foundation models to specialized application models for improved serving efficiency.
