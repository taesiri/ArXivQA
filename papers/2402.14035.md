# [Wisdom of Committee: Distilling from Foundation Model to Specialized   Application Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14035)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Foundation models like BERT and GPT have shown impressive performance across many tasks. However, they are often too large and inefficient for specialized applications. Meanwhile, practitioners have developed custom smaller models optimized for serving specific applications.  
- A natural path is to transfer knowledge from foundation models to specialized application models via distillation. However, there are significant challenges due to large gaps in model capacity, architecture, training data distribution, and input features between foundation and application models.

Proposed Solution
- Create a teaching committee with both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers that are more similar to the student application model. This helps bridge the gap for smoother knowledge transfer.
- Introduce DiverseDistill - an interactive distillation method where the student asks tailored questions to each teacher based on modeling their expertise, and learns from the teachers' answers. This allows handling arbitrary combinations of diverse teachers.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate benefits of using both foundation and complementary teachers compared to using just one type of teacher
- DiverseDistill consistently outperforms baseline distillation methods by allowing the student to understand each teacher's specialty and extract the most useful knowledge
- Show significant student performance improvements on both recommendation and vision tasks using language models, vision models, and specialized application models as teachers

In summary, the paper proposes creating a diverse teaching committee and an interactive student-teacher distillation process to effectively transfer knowledge from foundation models to specialized application models for improved serving efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes creating a diverse teacher committee comprising both foundation models and complementary models that are more similar to the student, and introduces DiverseDistill, an interactive distillation method that allows the student to understand the expertise of each teacher and extract task knowledge tailored for the student.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper hypothesizes that forming a teacher committee comprising both foundation models and complementary models that are more similar to the specialized application student model can lead to smoother and more effective knowledge transfer from the foundation model to the specialized application model.

2. The paper proposes a distillation framework called \name{} that learns a distillation module along with the student model to support distillation from a diverse set of teachers without constraints on the teachers. The distillation module includes a Question Augmenter and an Answer Augmenter to enable a two-way communicative process between the student and teachers.

3. Through experiments on recommendation and vision tasks, the paper demonstrates that:
(a) Adding complementary teachers in addition to the foundation model teacher enhances student performance, confirming the benefit of the teacher committee. 
(b) \name{} consistently and significantly outperforms baseline distillation methods in accommodating the diverse teacher committee, leading to the best student performance regardless of teacher choices.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) the concept of using a diverse teacher committee, 2) the proposed \name{} distillation framework, and 3) experimental validation of the benefits of the diverse committee and effectiveness of \name{}.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Foundation models - Large models trained on massive amounts of data in an unsupervised fashion that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. Examples include BERT, GPT, CLIP, etc.

- Specialized application models - Models optimized for specific downstream tasks like recommendation systems or vision models. Tend to have different architectures, input features, etc. compared to foundation models.  

- Knowledge distillation - Transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model to reduce serving costs while preserving performance.

- Complementary teachers - Teachers that are more similar to the student model than the foundation model in terms of architecture, input features, training data distribution. Help to bridge the gap with the foundation model.

- Question Augmenter and Answer Augmenter - Additional modules introduced in the proposed DiverseDistill method to allow tailored communication between the student and each teacher.  

- Task regularizer - Objective that encourages the distillation module to generate task-relevant questions and answers.

- Teacher importance score - Score reflecting the usefulness of each teacher for a given data sample. Can be used to select the most relevant teacher(s).

So in summary, key ideas include using both foundation and complementary teacher models, an interactive question-answer distillation process, and modeling each teacher's expertise.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a "teaching committee" with both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using a diverse set of teachers compared to using just the foundation model as the teacher?

2. The Question Augmenter module generates tailored questions for each teacher based on modeling the expertise of each teacher. How exactly does it model the expertise of each teacher and use that to generate appropriate questions? 

3. The Answer Augmenter consists of separate MLPs for each teacher to generate answers. What is the motivation behind using separate MLPs instead of a shared MLP? How does this design choice impact modeling the diverse set of teachers?

4. The distillation loss is computed between the student's hidden states and the weighted combination of answers from the teachers. Why use hidden states instead of logits for computing the distillation loss? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The method introduces a task regularizer loss to encourage generation of task-relevant questions and answers. What would happen without this task regularizer? How exactly does the task regularizer achieve this?

6. Could the importance scores assigned to teachers be used for dynamic teacher selection to reduce computational cost? What are some ways to set thresholds on importance scores for teacher selection?

7. How does the method accommodate differences in architecture, input features, and training data between the student and diverse set of teachers? What modifications would be needed to apply it to other domains?

8. What are some ways the question generation and answer generation components could be improved or extended? For example, allowing multiple rounds of questions and answers.

9. The evaluations are limited to recommendation and vision tasks. What are some other potential application areas where this method could be beneficial for transferring knowledge from foundation models?

10. How does the performance of this method degrade when there are even more substantial differences between the teachers themselves in terms of architectures, capacities, and training data distributions?
