# [Video Language Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10625)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to enable visual planning for complex long-horizon tasks by leveraging recent advances in large generative models pretrained on internet-scale data. 

Specifically, the authors propose an algorithm called "video language planning" (VLP) that combines vision-language models and text-to-video models to generate detailed video plans that provide multimodal (video and language) specifications for completing long-horizon robotics tasks. The key hypothesis is that by combining these two types of generative models in a tree search procedure, VLP can synthesize higher quality and more feasible long-horizon plans compared to using either model alone.

In summary, the main research question is how to develop an algorithm that harnesses the complementary strengths of vision-language models (for high-level reasoning) and text-to-video models (for low-level visual dynamics) in order to enable more effective visual planning over long time horizons. VLP is proposed as a solution that synergizes these models through tree search.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting "video language planning" (VLP), an algorithm that uses vision-language models and text-to-video models to generate long-horizon video plans for completing complex tasks. 

Specifically, the key ideas presented are:

- Using a vision-language model (VLM) as both a policy to propose abstract text actions, and a value function to evaluate future states. 

- Using a text-to-video model to simulate possible future outcomes of text actions.

- Combining the VLM and text-to-video model through tree search to generate long video plans that respect visual dynamics.

- Showing how these video plans can be executed on real robots through goal-conditioned policies.

- Demonstrating that VLP substantially improves performance on long-horizon robot manipulation tasks compared to prior methods.

The main novelty is in the integration of VLMs and text-to-video models in a planning framework to generate detailed video predictions. This allows leveraging the strengths of both models - abstract reasoning from VLMs and visual dynamics from video models. The key result is that VLP enables robots to successfully complete more complex, long-horizon tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents Video Language Planning (VLP), an algorithm that uses vision-language models as policies and value functions and text-to-video models as dynamics models to generate long-horizon video plans for completing complex tasks specified by natural language instructions and an initial image observation. VLP combines the strengths of VLMs for high-level planning and text-to-video models for low-level dynamics modeling to synthesize detailed video plans that can be executed on real robots.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of video and language planning for robots:

- The key innovation is in combining vision-language models with text-to-video generative models to enable video language planning. This provides a way to leverage the strengths of both types of models - abstract reasoning and language understanding from VLMs, and dynamics modeling from video models. 

- Most prior work has focused on using just vision-language models or just text-to-video models. Using both together in a planning framework is novel. For example, some prior work uses VLMs to generate textual plans, but doesn't convert them to videos. Other work generates videos directly from text prompts, but without an explicit planning procedure.

- The video planning approach enables leveraging incomplete video data, where only some segments have language labels. The dynamics can still be learned from unlabeled portions. VLMs alone would struggle with incomplete language labels.

- Scaling video planning through tree search over possible futures is also a key contribution. This allows plan quality to improve with more computation. Prior video generation models struggle to go beyond very short horizons. 

- The applications demonstrated, like long-horizon robot manipulation tasks, require reasoning and planning capabilities beyond what most prior methods have achieved. For example, prior methods often execute shorter instruction following tasks.

- There are still some limitations, like issues with physics violations in generated videos, and the need for more training data diversity. But overall, combining VLMs and video models in a planning framework significantly pushes capabilities on complex, long-horizon robot tasks.

In summary, the synergistic combination of different large neural network models via planning is a noteworthy advancement compared to prior work in this space. The results demonstrate substantially improved performance on challenging robot manipulation tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the video model to generate higher-quality and longer videos. The authors note current video models struggle to generate very long coherent videos and sometimes generate unrealistic dynamics like objects disappearing/teleporting. They suggest larger models, more training data, and incorporating explicit physics losses could help.

- Using more expressive world state representations beyond just images, such as 3D representations or encodings of physical properties like mass and friction. This could improve the accuracy of planning and reasoning about the effects of actions.

- Exploring other modalities besides just text instructions and vision, like leveraging natural language dialogue, gestures, or human feedback during plan execution. This could make specifying tasks and correcting mistakes easier.

- Extending the framework to more complex domains like full mobile manipulation in unstructured home/office environments. Testing the limits of generalization.

- Leveraging more types of foundation models beyond just VLMs and video models. For example, integrating interactive models, 3D/graphics engines, audio models, etc.

- Studying the scalability and computational properties of the planning algorithm in more depth, like parallelization and hardware optimization.

- Applying the idea of composing multiple foundation models through planning more broadly, such as in fields like drug discovery, materials science, education, etc.

In summary, the key directions are improving the underlying models, expanding to more complex domains, integrating more modalities, leveraging more foundation model types, and further analysis of the planning approach. The authors position video language planning as a case study for algorithmically combining pretrained models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper presents Video Language Planning (VLP), an algorithm that uses vision-language models and text-to-video models to generate long-horizon video plans for completing complex robot manipulation tasks. VLP takes an initial image observation and language goal as input, and outputs a detailed multimodal (video + language) plan describing how to accomplish the goal over many time steps. It works by using a vision-language model (VLM) as a policy to propose possible text actions, a text-to-video model to simulate possible outcomes of those actions, and the VLM again as a value function to evaluate the outcomes. By iteratively generating text actions, simulating videos, and evaluating them with the VLM, VLP performs a tree search to find high-quality video plans. Experiments show VLP can successfully control robots to complete long-horizon rearrangement and manipulation tasks in both simulation and the real world, substantially outperforming prior methods. The key ideas are using VLMs and video models in combination, leveraging their complementary strengths in high-level reasoning and low-level prediction, and using tree search to find plans that optimize predicted task completion.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Video Language Planning (VLP), an algorithm for generating long-horizon video plans to accomplish complex multi-step tasks. VLP leverages recent advances in large generative models pre-trained on internet data, specifically combining vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-video models. It uses a tree search procedure where the VLM serves as both the policy to propose text action steps and the value function to evaluate future video predictions. The text-to-video model serves as the dynamics model to predict possible future video outcomes for each action. By iteratively prompting the VLM policy, using the video model to simulate rollouts, and evaluating options with the VLM value function, VLP can synthesize long coherent video plans that respect visual dynamics. The generated plans provide detailed visual specifications in the form of subgoal images and corresponding language descriptions of actions needed to solve the final task. 

The authors demonstrate VLP on a variety of robot manipulation tasks, including multi-object rearrangement, dexterous bi-manual manipulation, and mobile manipulation. Experiments in simulation and on real robots (across 3 platforms) show that VLP generates higher quality plans and achieves substantially better task completion rates compared to prior methods. Ablations also demonstrate VLP's ability to scale planning with additional compute and generalize to new objects and configurations when trained on diverse internet data. Limitations include the inability to fully capture 3D state and physics. Overall, the paper illustrates how combining complementary strengths of VLMs and video models through planning enables synthesizing more complete long-horizon visual plans.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a video language planning (VLP) algorithm that leverages both vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-video models to generate long-horizon video plans for completing complex robotic manipulation tasks. VLP uses the VLM as both a policy to propose high-level text action steps, and as a value function to evaluate future states. It uses the text-to-video model to predict the visual outcomes of taking those text action steps. VLP performs tree search by iteratively prompting the VLM policy to generate possible next text actions, using the video model to predict possible future video rollouts for each action, and using the VLM value function to select the best predicted rollout to extend the plan. This allows VLP to search over long video plan horizons to find coherent plans that respect visual dynamics. The final video plans can be executed on a robot using a separate goal-conditioned policy that takes actions to reach each frame in the planned video.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of enabling visual planning for complex long-horizon robotics tasks. Specifically, it is looking at how to leverage recent advances in large generative models pretrained on internet-scale data (like vision-language models and text-to-video models) to plan detailed video predictions that can guide a robot through multi-step instructions to achieve goals.

The key questions the paper seems to be asking are:

- How can we combine vision-language models (that are good at high-level semantic reasoning) and text-to-video models (that are good at low-level visual dynamics) to generate coherent and accurate long-horizon video plans? 

- Can these video plans, when translated to actions via goal-conditioned policies, enable robots to successfully complete complex multi-step tasks in both simulation and the real world?

- Does this approach allow the plan quality to scale up with more compute, by expanding the search tree?

- Can the approach generalize to new objects, configurations, and tasks by leveraging internet-scale pretraining?

So in summary, the key focus is on integrating these two types of generative models to unlock improved visual planning and task execution for robots following natural language instructions over long horizons.
