# [Focus on Your Instruction: Fine-grained and Multi-instruction Image   Editing by Attention Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10113)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing instruction-based image editing methods like InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) struggle with unintended over-editing of areas unrelated to the instruction. This gets worse with multiple instructions leading to compromised outcomes.
- They lack the ability to precisely identify and focus editing on intended regions specified in instructions.

Proposed Solution - Focus on Your Instruction (FoI):  
- Leverages implicit spatial grounding ability of IP2P to extract precise regions of interest for each instruction.
- Uses cross-attention modulation to focus each instruction's effect within its extracted region, reducing interference between instructions. 
- Employs mask-guided disentangled sampling strategy to further isolate editing regions and distinguish between editing directions and preservation.

Key Contributions:
- Uncovers and utilizes grounding capability of IP2P for fine-grained localization of editing regions using extracted masks.
- Introduces cross-attention modulation based on null-text cross-attention to modulate attention for each instruction.
- Proposes mask-guided disentangled sampling to separate editing areas from unchanged regions.
- Demonstrates quantitatively and qualitatively that FoI enhances precision of editing, especially for multiple instructions, without extra training or tuning.

In summary, the paper tackles imprecise over-editing in instruction-based image editing by developing FoI to leverage grounding within IP2P for focused application of instructions only on intended areas. This is achieved through attention modulation and disentangled sampling guided by spatially precise instruction-based masks.
