# [Error-free Training for Artificial Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16060)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Conventional training methods for artificial neural networks (ANNs) are unable to systematically achieve zero error rates on large datasets like the MNIST benchmark for handwritten digit classification. 
- Methods like stochastic gradient descent can get stuck in local minima of the loss function and fail to find the global minimum that corresponds to perfect accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the ANN training problem as finding fixed points of a parameterized transformation in the training parameter space.
- Prove a "Continuation Theorem" that if perfect global minima exist for a continuum of parameterized hybrid datasets, they form a continuous path that can be followed from the auxiliary dataset to the original. 
- Develop a "gradient descent tunneling" (GDT) method with backtrack correction to continue along the path of global minima from auxiliary to original dataset.

Key Contributions:
- Provides a theoretical guarantee that GDT will converge to the global minimum with 100% accuracy on the original dataset if sufficient parameters exist for perfect accuracy on an auxiliary dataset.
- Demonstrates 100% test accuracy on MNIST for ANN architectures with as few as 15910 parameters using the new GDT training method.
- Empirically shows GDT finds better minima than conventional SGD and does not suffer from overfitting issues.
- Suggests best practices like using the new "switch" activation over ReLU, and accumulating trained data in continual learning tasks.
- Showcases ability of method to completely segment high-dimensional dataset, enabling full utilization of ANN potential.

In summary, the paper provides a novel theoretical framework and training methodology that can systematically achieve zero error rates on supervised learning tasks where sufficient parameters exist. It also gives guidance to maximize the potential of neural networks.
