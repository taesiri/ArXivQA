# [Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04495)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we design distributed policy networks for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning that are equivariant to global symmetries of the multi-agent system, while still allowing for distributed execution using only local information?

The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question seem to be:

- Proposing a factorization of global symmetries in the joint state-action space of cooperative multi-agent systems into symmetries on local observations and local interactions. 

- Introducing a class of networks called Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks that distribute the computation that enforces global symmetries over local agents and local interactions, enabling distributed execution while maintaining global equivariance constraints.

- Designing a specific multi-agent equivariant policy network architecture based on this proposed factorization, which uses group-equivariant convolutional encoders, equivariant message functions, and distributed message passing.

- Empirically evaluating Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks on symmetric multi-agent problems and showing improved data efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines.

So in summary, the key hypothesis is that distributing/factoring global symmetries into local agent symmetries will enable globally equivariant and data-efficient multi-agent learning while still allowing decentralized execution. The proposed Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Network architecture embodies this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, a class of distributed policy networks that are equivariant to global symmetries of cooperative multi-agent systems. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Proposing a factorization of global symmetries in the joint state-action space of cooperative multi-agent systems into local transformations on agent observations and interactions.

- Introducing a multi-agent equivariant policy network architecture based on this factorization that allows distributing the computation that enforces global symmetries over local agents and local interactions. 

- Empirically showing on symmetric multi-agent problems that globally symmetric distributable policies learned with this approach improve data efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines.

In summary, the main contribution is an approach to cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning that enables encoding global symmetries in a distributed manner to improve learning efficiency, while still allowing decentralized execution with only local computation and communication.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The paper introduces Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, which enforce global symmetries in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning while still allowing for distributed execution. This is a novel approach not explored in prior work, which has focused on either centralized approaches to symmetry or more limited permutation symmetries in multi-agent RL.

- Existing work on symmetries in single-agent RL (e.g. MDP homomorphisms, equivariant networks) cannot be applied in a distributed setting, as they rely on global state/action spaces. This paper proposes a factorization to distribute global symmetries across agents.

- Prior multi-agent RL methods using permutation symmetries provide anonymity between agents but do not capture more complex global symmetries. This paper moves beyond permutations to handle general transformation groups.

- The idea of decomposing global symmetries into local agent symmetries is unique. Enforcing symmetries locally while coordinating through message passing is a clever way to achieve global equivariance distributably.

- Empirically, the paper shows improved data efficiency on cooperative MARL problems when using the proposed homomorphic networks vs non-equivariant baselines. This aligns with findings in single-agent RL and highlights the benefits of symmetry in MARL.

- The experiments are fairly limited in scope, considering only small 2D problems and the C4 group. Testing on larger problems and generalization capabilities would strengthen the empirical contribution. 

Overall, this paper makes an important theoretical contribution in formalizing distributed symmetries for multi-agent RL. The proposed homomorphic networks offer a novel way to incorporate global structure while retaining distributed execution. More extensive empirical validation would be useful, but the paper represents an advance over existing methods by tackling a key limitation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring imperfect symmetries and violations of symmetry constraints. The current work focuses on exact symmetries, but the authors suggest extending the approach to deal with imperfect/approximate symmetries as well.

- Generalizing to larger groups beyond small discrete groups like C4. The computational requirements scale with the group size, so extending to larger continuous groups is identified as an area for future work, perhaps by using steerable CNNs.

- Going beyond permutation matrices for actions on continuous action spaces. For example, using continuous rotations rather than permutations for 2D action spaces.

- Scaling up the approach to more complex environments and tasks, as well as real world applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and decentralized smart grids. Further testing the impact on data efficiency and performance.

- Considering different network architectures beyond message passing networks. The factorization of symmetries could potentially be applied in other network architectures. 

- Analyzing the theoretical properties of the proposed factorization and equivariance constraints more formally.

- Extending the approach beyond cooperative multi-agent systems to competitive settings like zero-sum games.

In summary, the main directions are scaling up the approach to larger groups and more complex tasks, generalizing beyond discrete groups and actions, applying the factorization idea to other architectures, formal theoretical analysis, and extending to competitive multi-agent settings. The key focus is on improving, generalizing and analyzing the proposed factorization of symmetries.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on skimming the paper, it seems the main contribution is proposing Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, a class of distributed policy networks that are equivariant to global symmetries in cooperative multiagent systems while still allowing for distributed execution. The key ideas are factorizing global symmetries into local transformations and using message passing networks with equivariant constraints on the message functions to distribute computation and enforce the global symmetries.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, a class of networks that allows distributed execution using only local information, yet is able to share experience between global symmetries in the joint state-action space of cooperative multi-agent systems. In cooperative multi-agent systems, complex symmetries arise between different configurations of the agents and their local observations. For example, consider a group of agents navigating: rotating the state globally results in a permutation of the optimal joint policy. Existing work on symmetries in single agent reinforcement learning can only be generalized to the fully centralized setting, because such approaches rely on the global symmetry in the full state-action spaces, and these can result in correspondences across agents. To encode such symmetries while still allowing distributed execution the authors propose a factorization that decomposes global symmetries into local transformations. Their proposed factorization allows for distributing the computation that enforces global symmetries over local agents and local interactions. They introduce a multi-agent equivariant policy network based on this factorization. Empirically, on symmetric multi-agent problems, globally symmetric distributable policies are shown to improve data efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, a new class of networks for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. The key idea is to design networks that can distribute computation and allow agents to act based only on local information, while still enforcing global symmetries and equivariance constraints. This is achieved through a novel factorization of global symmetries into local transformations on individual agents and their interactions. 

First, the paper formalizes symmetries and equivariance for multi-agent Markov Decision Processes. It then shows how global symmetries can be decomposed into local symmetries on agent observations, locations, and interactions. Building on this, the paper proposes a specific network architecture called Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks. These networks use equivariant encoders, message functions, and classifiers that transform appropriately under the factorized symmetries. Experiments on multi-agent problems with rotational symmetry demonstrate improved data efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines. A key contribution is an approach to enforce global equivariance constraints in a fully distributed manner suitable for decentralized cooperative multi-agent systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, a class of distributed policy networks for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problems with global symmetries. The key idea is to factorize global symmetries into local transformations on agent observations and interactions. This allows enforcing equivariance to global symmetries in a distributed manner during policy execution, through equivariant message passing between agents. Specifically, the method uses equivariant encoders to encode local agent observations, equivariant message functions to communicate between neighboring agents, and equivariant node update functions to integrate messages. By constraining these components to be equivariant to symmetries acting on the local states and interactions, global equivariance is achieved. This allows the policy network to learn effectively in the reduced MDP induced by the symmetries. Experiments on multi-agent navigation and traffic light control tasks demonstrate improved data efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to exploit global symmetries in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning systems while still allowing for distributed execution. 

In particular, the paper points out that existing approaches for using symmetries in single-agent RL rely on symmetries in the full state-action space and cannot be applied in a distributed multi-agent setting with local agent observations. The key challenge is enforcing global symmetries across agents while only requiring local communication and computation.

To address this, the paper proposes a factorization that decomposes global symmetries into local transformations on individual agents and their interactions. This allows distributing the computation that enforces global symmetries over local agents. 

The main contribution is introducing "Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks", which are networks that:

1) Allow distributed execution using only local information

2) Can share experience between global symmetries in the joint state-action space  

3) Decompose global symmetries into local agent computations/communications

The proposed networks are evaluated on symmetric multi-agent RL problems and shown to improve data efficiency compared to non-equivariant baselines.

In summary, the key problem addressed is exploiting global symmetries in a distributed multi-agent setting by factorizing global symmetries into local agent computations and interactions. This allows better leveraging symmetries while retaining distributed execution.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks, a type of network architecture that enables distributed execution in cooperative multi-agent systems while still sharing experience between global symmetries in the joint state-action space. Existing work on exploiting symmetries in reinforcement learning is limited to single agent settings or fully centralized multi-agent systems. However, in many real-world multi-agent systems, agents must operate in a distributed fashion with local observations and local communication. 

To enable distributed policies that still exploit global symmetries, the authors propose factorizing global symmetries into local transformations on individual agents and their local interactions. Their key insight is that relative transformations of local observations and communications appear as global transformations from an agent's local perspective. Based on this factorization, they introduce Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks which constrain message passing layers to be equivariant to these local transformations. This allows the distributed policies to implicitly encode global symmetries while using only local computation and communication during execution.

The authors evaluate Multi-Agent MDP Homomorphic Networks on cooperative multi-agent tasks with rotational symmetries, including wildlife monitoring and traffic light control. Compared to non-equivariant baselines, their method shows improved data efficiency from effectively sharing experience between symmetric states. The results demonstrate that encoding global symmetries in a distributed multi-agent policy network improves learning in cooperative settings with repetitive state patterns. Overall, this is a novel approach to integrating equivariance in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning.
