# Image Inpainting with Learnable Bidirectional Attention Maps

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it aims to address is how to develop an effective convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for image inpainting that can handle irregular holes and generate sharper and more coherent results. The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:1) Using learnable attention maps in place of hard 0-1 masks and handcrafted feature renormalization as in partial convolutions can make the model more effective at adapting to irregular holes and propagating information across layers. 2) Employing both forward and reverse attention maps in a bidirectional manner allows concentrating on filling in holes and improves results compared to only using forward attention maps.3) The proposed learnable bidirectional attention maps (LBAM) module incorporated into a U-Net architecture can generate higher quality inpainting results that are sharper, more coherent, and more realistic compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the central research question is how to develop an end-to-end trainable CNN model for irregular image inpainting that surpasses current methods, with the key hypothesis being that the proposed LBAM module will achieve this. The experiments conducted aim to validate the effectiveness of LBAM and the improvement over other approaches.
