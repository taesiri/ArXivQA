# [Image Inpainting with Learnable Bidirectional Attention Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00968)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question it aims to address is how to develop an effective convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for image inpainting that can handle irregular holes and generate sharper and more coherent results. 

The key hypotheses proposed in the paper are:

1) Using learnable attention maps in place of hard 0-1 masks and handcrafted feature renormalization as in partial convolutions can make the model more effective at adapting to irregular holes and propagating information across layers. 

2) Employing both forward and reverse attention maps in a bidirectional manner allows concentrating on filling in holes and improves results compared to only using forward attention maps.

3) The proposed learnable bidirectional attention maps (LBAM) module incorporated into a U-Net architecture can generate higher quality inpainting results that are sharper, more coherent, and more realistic compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the central research question is how to develop an end-to-end trainable CNN model for irregular image inpainting that surpasses current methods, with the key hypothesis being that the proposed LBAM module will achieve this. The experiments conducted aim to validate the effectiveness of LBAM and the improvement over other approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a learnable attention map module for image inpainting which is more flexible and adaptable to irregular holes compared to partial convolutions (PConv). The learnable attention maps can be trained end-to-end to learn feature re-normalization and mask updating.

- Introducing forward and reverse attention maps to form learnable bidirectional attention maps (LBAM). The forward maps operate on the encoder features while the reverse maps operate on the decoder features. This allows the decoder to focus on filling in missing holes rather than reproducing the entire image. 

- Evaluations on Paris StreetView and Places datasets showing the proposed LBAM method performs favorably against prior state-of-the-art methods like PConv in terms of generating sharper, more coherent, and visually plausible inpainting results, especially for irregular holes.

- Demonstrating the proposed LBAM enables stable adversarial training to improve visual quality, which was difficult with PConv.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an end-to-end learnable attention map module with bidirectional maps for image inpainting that improves handling of irregular holes and visual quality over prior approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a learnable bidirectional attention module that uses forward and reverse attention maps to focus on filling in irregular holes in images, allowing their method to generate sharper and more coherent inpainting results compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in image inpainting:

- Uses deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs): Most recent advances in image inpainting rely on deep learning, especially CNNs which excel at image tasks. This aligns with the trend.

- Handles irregular holes: Many early CNN inpainting methods could only handle rectangular regions. This paper aims to handle free-form holes, which is more challenging and practical. Other recent works like partial convolution have also focused on irregular holes.

- Bidirectional attention mechanism: The proposed learnable bidirectional attention maps are novel. They allow attending to different regions in the input and output, improving results. Other works have not used this bidirectional attention concept.

- Combines global and local information: Their model utilizes both global semantic information and local texture details for inpainting. This matches most CNN approaches which aim to generate coherent global structure and realistic local textures.

- Adaopts adversarial training: They use a discriminator and adversarial loss to improve image quality. This technique has become common in image generation tasks.

- Faster than some prior works: Their model is relatively efficient compared to prior approaches like contextual attention. Efficiency has been an aim for improved deep inpainting.

- Visual results are state-of-the-art: The inpainting results appear sharper, more coherent, and more visually plausible than previous methods. Performance seems improved over other recent works.

In summary, this paper incorporates recent deep learning advances like attention and adversarial training, while innovating with bidirectional attention to achieve improved irregular image inpainting, advancing the state-of-the-art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different network architectures for the learnable bidirectional attention maps, such as using attention mechanisms or other types of context modeling. The current U-Net architecture may be further optimized.

- Incorporating semantic or contour information into the attention maps, rather than purely using the input mask. This could improve structure and detail generation. 

- Extending the method to video inpainting by taking temporal information into account in the attention maps.

- Applying the learnable bidirectional attention maps to other low-level vision tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, etc. The attention concept may generalize.

- Validating the approach on a larger variety of irregular mask shapes and investigating how to handle more extreme cases.

- Exploring perceptual losses beyond VGG, other adversarial losses, or auxiliary losses to further enhance training and visual quality.

- Quantitatively evaluating the separate contributions of the forward attention, reverse attention, and learnable components.

So in summary, the main future directions are around refining the model architecture, incorporating semantic information, expanding to videos, applying to other tasks, increasing robustness, and enhancing training objectives. The learnable attention concept shows promise but can be taken further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a learnable bidirectional attention map module for image inpainting. Previous convolutional neural network (CNN) based inpainting methods use standard convolution which treats valid pixels and holes identically, making them limited in handling irregular holes. Partial convolution addresses this by using mask convolution and feature renormalization, but it has limitations due to using hard 0-1 masks and handcrafted rules. This paper presents a learnable attention map module that learns feature renormalization and mask updating in an end-to-end manner, making it more flexible and adaptive to irregular holes. Furthermore, forward and reverse attention maps are incorporated, allowing the decoder to focus only on filling in holes. Experiments on Paris StreetView and Places datasets show the method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in generating sharper, more coherent, and visually plausible inpainting results. The learnable bidirectional attention maps are more effective in hallucinating semantic structures and realistic textures compared to partial convolution.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a learnable bidirectional attention map module for image inpainting. Image inpainting aims to fill in missing or corrupted regions in images. Many convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods adopt standard convolution layers which treat both valid and missing pixels equally. This makes them limited in handling irregular holes and prone to generating results with color discrepancy and blurriness. Partial convolution was proposed to address this issue but has limitations due to its use of hard 0-1 masks and handcrafted feature renormalization. 

This paper introduces a learnable attention map module that learns to renormalize features and update masks in an end-to-end manner. This allows adaptation to irregular holes and propagation through layers. Forward and reverse attention maps are used on the encoder and decoder features respectively of a U-Net architecture. The reverse maps allow the decoder to focus only on filling in holes. Experiments on Paris StreetView and Places datasets demonstrate the method generates sharper, more coherent and visually plausible results compared to state-of-the-art methods. The learnable bidirectional attention maps are more effective in handling irregular holes and improving visual quality.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method presented in the paper:

The paper proposes a learnable bidirectional attention map (LBAM) module for image inpainting. The method modifies the U-Net architecture by incorporating forward attention layers in the encoder and reverse attention layers in the decoder. The forward attention layers take the input mask and learn to renormalize the encoder features focusing on propagating information from valid pixels into the holes. The reverse attention layers take the inverted mask and learn to renormalize the decoder features to focus only on generating the content of holes and ignore the valid regions. Unlike partial convolutions which uses fixed masks, the attention maps and their corresponding masks are learned end-to-end along with the network parameters. This allows the model to adapt to irregular hole shapes. The encoder-decoder structure and bidirectional attention enables the model to utilize both global semantics from the encoder and detailed textures from the decoder to generate sharper, coherent inpainting results. Experiments show the method performs better than previous approaches, especially for irregular holes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the main problem this paper is addressing is how to effectively fill in irregular holes in images using deep learning based image inpainting methods. Some key points:

- Image inpainting aims to fill in missing or damaged regions (holes) in images. This is an ill-posed problem since there can be multiple plausible ways to fill the holes.

- Traditional exemplar-based methods can synthesize textures well but fail to generate complex structures and semantics. Recent CNN-based methods can generate semantically plausible results but struggle with irregular holes.

- Standard convolution layers treat both valid pixels and holes identically, making them limited for irregular holes. Partial convolution was proposed to address this, but it uses hardcoded renormalization and only forward mask updating.

- This paper proposes a learnable bidirectional attention map module to learn feature renormalization and bidirectional mask updating, making it more flexible and effective for irregular holes.

- Forward attention maps propagate information from valid regions into the holes, while reverse attention maps allow the decoder to focus only on reconstructing the holes.

- Experiments show the proposed method generates sharper and more coherent inpainting results compared to prior arts, especially for irregular holes.

In summary, the key contribution is a learnable bidirectional attention mechanism for deep image inpainting that can better handle irregular mask shapes by learning to attend to valid versus missing regions appropriately.
