# [Kattis vs. ChatGPT: Assessment and Evaluation of Programming Tasks in   the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01109)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
With the emergence of powerful AI systems like ChatGPT that can generate computer code, there are open questions around their capability to accurately solve programming problems, especially in introductory programming courses. This has implications for relying on such systems to complete assignments and ensure students properly learn programming concepts. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors conducted an experiment to evaluate how well ChatGPT can solve 127 randomly selected programming problems from an automated grading system called Kattis which is widely used in programming courses. The problems spanned various difficulty levels. ChatGPT solutions were submitted to Kattis which would approve or reject them. The accuracy of ChatGPT was quantified based on percentage of solutions approved and error analysis was conducted.

Key Contributions:
- Only 15% of ChatGPT solutions were fully approved, showing limited capability currently to solve wide range of problems 
- ChatGPT solved 19/127 problems overall, mainly at easy difficulty levels
- For rejected solutions, 77% were wrong answers, 15% crashed, 8% exceeded time limits
- ChatGPT performed better on problems that had higher historical solution rates in Kattis system

In summary, the study found ChatGPT has restricted proficiency today in solving programming problems across difficulty levels. This suggests students should use caution in fully relying on ChatGPT for assignments. The results contribute knowledge about generative AI performance that informs teaching practices and academic integrity considerations.
