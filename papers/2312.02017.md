# [A multi-channel cycleGAN for CBCT to CT synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02017)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-channel cycleGAN approach for generating high-quality synthetic CT images from cone-beam CT scans to facilitate adaptive radiotherapy treatment planning and dose calculation. The method leverages a three-channel input for the CBCT and CT images in the cycleGAN framework, emphasizing different anatomical features - full image range, soft tissue contrast, and high-density structures. An additional fusion network further enhances the fidelity of the final synthetic CT output. When evaluated on the SynthRAD2023 challenge dataset, the approach demonstrates robustness to common CBCT artifacts while restoring necessary contrast and anatomical details. Quantitatively, the method achieves promising performance with an average mean absolute error of 71-72 HU, peak signal-to-noise ratio of 28-29 dB, and structural similarity index of 0.86 on the validation and hidden test sets. The accurate preservation of patient anatomy also translates well for dose calculation, with over 98% 2%/2mm gamma pass rate for photon plans. By addressing key imaging challenges and incorporating complementary multi-channel information, this work represents an effective solution for CBCT to CT synthesis in the context of adaptive radiotherapy.
