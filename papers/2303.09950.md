# [Deep Graph-based Spatial Consistency for Robust Non-rigid Point Cloud   Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) for outlier rejection in non-rigid point cloud registration. The main research question it addresses is how to effectively prune outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes the first learning-based method for outlier rejection specially designed for non-rigid point cloud registration. Previous outlier rejection methods focus on rigid registration.

- Introduces a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the compatibility of correspondences locally based on the deformation graph. This leverages the assumption of local rigidity of non-rigid deformations.

- Designs an attention-based non-rigid correspondence embedding module that learns robust correspondence features incorporating the proposed local spatial consistency measure.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging non-rigid registration benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods.

In summary, the paper presents a new deep learning-based framework to tackle the challenging problem of outlier rejection for non-rigid point cloud registration, by designing a local spatial consistency measure tailored for non-rigid settings. The core research question is how to discriminatively identify inlier vs outlier correspondences for accurate non-rigid registration.
