# [Deep Graph-based Spatial Consistency for Robust Non-rigid Point Cloud   Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) for outlier rejection in non-rigid point cloud registration. The main research question it addresses is how to effectively prune outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes the first learning-based method for outlier rejection specially designed for non-rigid point cloud registration. Previous outlier rejection methods focus on rigid registration.

- Introduces a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the compatibility of correspondences locally based on the deformation graph. This leverages the assumption of local rigidity of non-rigid deformations.

- Designs an attention-based non-rigid correspondence embedding module that learns robust correspondence features incorporating the proposed local spatial consistency measure.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging non-rigid registration benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods.

In summary, the paper presents a new deep learning-based framework to tackle the challenging problem of outlier rejection for non-rigid point cloud registration, by designing a local spatial consistency measure tailored for non-rigid settings. The core research question is how to discriminatively identify inlier vs outlier correspondences for accurate non-rigid registration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an outlier rejection network for non-rigid point cloud registration, which is the first learning-based approach for outlier correspondence pruning in non-rigid scenarios. 

2. Introducing a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the geometric compatibility between correspondences within local regions based on the local rigidity of deformations.

3. Designing an attention-based correspondence embedding module that leverages local spatial consistency to extract robust correspondence features for discriminating inliers and outliers.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a deep learning framework named Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) to effectively reject outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. This is achieved by encoding local spatial consistency into correspondence features and training a neural network to classify each correspondence as inlier or outlier. 

The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three challenging benchmarks. It significantly improves the registration accuracy compared to using the raw putative correspondences. The results demonstrate the efficacy of modeling local rigidity of deformations and incorporating spatial consistency in a local neighborhood to handle complex non-rigid transformations.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes a novel graph-based local spatial consistency measure for outlier rejection in non-rigid point cloud registration. Most prior work has focused on outlier rejection for rigid registration. The idea of using local rigidity/isometry of non-rigid deformations to define a local spatial consistency measure is innovative. 

- The proposed method is the first learning-based approach for outlier rejection in non-rigid registration, to the best of the authors' knowledge. Prior learning-based methods like PointDSC and PointCN focused on rigid registration.

- The paper shows strong quantitative results on challenging benchmarks like 4DMatch, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods like NDP by a significant margin (>10% on key metrics). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

- The idea of constructing a deformation graph and using graph-based attention to capture local spatial consistency seems elegant and well-motivated. This differentiates the approach from other outlier rejection techniques.

- The method exhibits good generalization ability, showing strong performance on CAPE and DeepDeform when trained solely on 4DMatch. This highlights its robustness.

- Compared to some prior work that relies on geodesic distances, the use of Euclidean distances and uniformly sampled nodes provides better efficiency and robustness.

Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution in addressing the challenging problem of outlier rejection for non-rigid registration, proposing a novel graph-based local spatial consistency measure and learning-based framework. The strong results validate the efficacy of the approach and mark an advance over prior art.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest the following main future research directions:

1. Extend the method for end-to-end non-rigid registration: The current method serves as an outlier rejection module that takes putative correspondences as input and outputs filtered inlier correspondences. The authors suggest extending it to build an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes correspondence extraction and non-rigid registration. 

2. Handle sudden geometric changes: The proposed method is based on deformation graphs and the assumption of local rigidity of deformations. The authors point out it may have difficulty in modeling sudden changes in geometric structures. Future work could aim to make the framework more flexible to handle such cases.

3. Improve correspondence coverage: The current method focuses on pruning outliers from the input correspondences. The authors suggest exploring ways to also improve the coverage of correspondences over the point clouds. This could help provide denser constraints for registration.

4. Real-world benchmark: The experiments are mainly on synthetic data. The authors suggest constructing a real-world non-rigid benchmark to facilitate future research and evaluate generalizability.  

5. Theoretical analysis: The authors suggest providing more theoretical analysis on the properties of the proposed local spatial consistency measure and its benefits compared to global consistency.

In summary, the main suggestions are to extend the framework for end-to-end registration, handle more complex deformations, improve correspondence coverage, construct real-world benchmarks, and provide more theoretical analysis. The proposed research has shown promising results and opened up many directions for advancing non-rigid point cloud registration.
