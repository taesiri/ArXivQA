# [Deep Graph-based Spatial Consistency for Robust Non-rigid Point Cloud   Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) for outlier rejection in non-rigid point cloud registration. The main research question it addresses is how to effectively prune outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes the first learning-based method for outlier rejection specially designed for non-rigid point cloud registration. Previous outlier rejection methods focus on rigid registration.

- Introduces a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the compatibility of correspondences locally based on the deformation graph. This leverages the assumption of local rigidity of non-rigid deformations.

- Designs an attention-based non-rigid correspondence embedding module that learns robust correspondence features incorporating the proposed local spatial consistency measure.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging non-rigid registration benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods.

In summary, the paper presents a new deep learning-based framework to tackle the challenging problem of outlier rejection for non-rigid point cloud registration, by designing a local spatial consistency measure tailored for non-rigid settings. The core research question is how to discriminatively identify inlier vs outlier correspondences for accurate non-rigid registration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an outlier rejection network for non-rigid point cloud registration, which is the first learning-based approach for outlier correspondence pruning in non-rigid scenarios. 

2. Introducing a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the geometric compatibility between correspondences within local regions based on the local rigidity of deformations.

3. Designing an attention-based correspondence embedding module that leverages local spatial consistency to extract robust correspondence features for discriminating inliers and outliers.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a deep learning framework named Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) to effectively reject outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. This is achieved by encoding local spatial consistency into correspondence features and training a neural network to classify each correspondence as inlier or outlier. 

The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three challenging benchmarks. It significantly improves the registration accuracy compared to using the raw putative correspondences. The results demonstrate the efficacy of modeling local rigidity of deformations and incorporating spatial consistency in a local neighborhood to handle complex non-rigid transformations.
