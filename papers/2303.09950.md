# [Deep Graph-based Spatial Consistency for Robust Non-rigid Point Cloud   Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09950)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper proposes a new method called Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) for outlier rejection in non-rigid point cloud registration. The main research question it addresses is how to effectively prune outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. 

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Proposes the first learning-based method for outlier rejection specially designed for non-rigid point cloud registration. Previous outlier rejection methods focus on rigid registration.

- Introduces a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the compatibility of correspondences locally based on the deformation graph. This leverages the assumption of local rigidity of non-rigid deformations.

- Designs an attention-based non-rigid correspondence embedding module that learns robust correspondence features incorporating the proposed local spatial consistency measure.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging non-rigid registration benchmarks, significantly outperforming previous methods.

In summary, the paper presents a new deep learning-based framework to tackle the challenging problem of outlier rejection for non-rigid point cloud registration, by designing a local spatial consistency measure tailored for non-rigid settings. The core research question is how to discriminatively identify inlier vs outlier correspondences for accurate non-rigid registration.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing an outlier rejection network for non-rigid point cloud registration, which is the first learning-based approach for outlier correspondence pruning in non-rigid scenarios. 

2. Introducing a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates the geometric compatibility between correspondences within local regions based on the local rigidity of deformations.

3. Designing an attention-based correspondence embedding module that leverages local spatial consistency to extract robust correspondence features for discriminating inliers and outliers.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a deep learning framework named Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) to effectively reject outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. This is achieved by encoding local spatial consistency into correspondence features and training a neural network to classify each correspondence as inlier or outlier. 

The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three challenging benchmarks. It significantly improves the registration accuracy compared to using the raw putative correspondences. The results demonstrate the efficacy of modeling local rigidity of deformations and incorporating spatial consistency in a local neighborhood to handle complex non-rigid transformations.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors of the paper suggest the following main future research directions:

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a deep learning based method for pruning outlier correspondences in non-rigid point cloud registration. Non-rigid registration is challenging due to complex deformations and many outlier correspondences. Prior methods leverage spatial consistency to reject outliers, but this does not hold for non-rigid cases. 

The proposed method, Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet), introduces a graph-based local spatial consistency measure. This evaluates compatibility of correspondences only within the vicinity of nodes in a deformation graph over the point cloud. An attention-based correspondence embedding module is then used to extract robust features incorporating this local consistency. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming prior methods. The local spatial consistency provides a powerful criterion for identifying inliers and outliers despite complex non-rigid deformations. GraphSCNet is the first learning-based outlier rejection approach for non-rigid registration.

In summary, this paper tackles the challenging problem of outlier rejection for non-rigid point cloud registration. It leverages a novel local spatial consistency measure defined over a deformation graph to effectively discriminate inliers and outliers. Experiments validate the efficacy of GraphSCNet for robust non-rigid registration.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a deep learning based method called Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) for rejecting outliers in correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. The key idea is to leverage local rigidity of non-rigid deformations - that is, the deformations are locally rigid even though globally non-rigid. The method first constructs a deformation graph over the source point cloud and defines a local spatial consistency measure between correspondences assigned to each graph node. This captures the compatibility between correspondences within a local region. An attention-based graph correspondence embedding module is then proposed to encode this local spatial consistency into robust correspondence features, which are further classified into inliers vs outliers. By rejecting outliers via the local spatial consistency measure, the method is able to effectively prune outliers for non-rigid registration while retaining sufficient inliers. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphSCNet for outlier rejection compared to prior rigid registration methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper addresses the problem of pruning outlier correspondences for non-rigid point cloud registration. Extracting accurate correspondences between point clouds is crucial for non-rigid registration, but existing learning-based correspondence methods still produce outliers under significant deformation. Outlier rejection has been well studied for rigid registration, but extending it to non-rigid cases is challenging due to the complex deformations. This paper proposes the first learning-based method for outlier rejection tailored for non-rigid point cloud registration.

Specifically, the key questions addressed are:

- How to measure the compatibility of correspondences for non-rigid cases where global spatial consistency does not hold? The paper proposes a graph-based local spatial consistency measure that evaluates consistency only between correspondences within the vicinity of each graph node, based on the assumption of local rigidity of non-rigid deformations.

- How to effectively leverage local spatial consistency for learning robust correspondence features and rejecting outliers? The paper designs an attention-based graph correspondence embedding module that incorporates local consistency into the feature learning, making the features more discriminative for inlier/outlier classification.

- How to develop a learning-based outlier rejection network suitable for non-rigid registration? The overall network architecture and objectives are tailored around modeling local rigidity and extracting spatially consistent correspondence features for outlier pruning.

So in summary, the key novelty and contribution is in extending outlier rejection to the challenging non-rigid case by exploiting local spatial consistency and rigidity, through a dedicated graph-based network design. This fills an important gap and enables more robust non-rigid registration.
