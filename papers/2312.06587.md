# [QuickQuakeBuildings: Post-earthquake SAR-Optical Dataset for Quick   Damaged-building Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06587)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper presents the first dataset for detecting earthquake-damaged buildings using post-event satellite imagery. The dataset combines very high resolution (VHR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical images acquired after the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquakes with over 4,000 building footprints and labels indicating damage state. The problem is formulated as a binary image classification task between damaged and intact buildings. The dataset can facilitate algorithm development and benchmarking for rapid damage assessment, addressing the challenge of scarce labeled training data. It integrates openly available post-event satellite data and crowdsourced damage annotations. Baseline experiments using machine learning and deep learning models show SAR damage detection is valuable yet more challenging than with optical data. The benchmark results and detailed methodology serve as references for further research. Expansion of the current dataset is expected as more relevant data becomes available. The fusion of multi-modal post-event imagery may also enhance damage detection capabilities. Overall, the paper offers the community a starting point to advance methodologies for automated damage assessment in post-disaster satellite imagery.
