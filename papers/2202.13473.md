# [The Spectral Bias of Polynomial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13473)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is: What is the spectral bias of polynomial neural networks (PNNs), and how does it compare to standard neural networks? Specifically, the paper investigates whether PNNs exhibit a bias towards learning higher frequency functions faster compared to standard neural networks, which have been shown to have a bias towards learning lower frequency functions. The authors hypothesize that the use of polynomial activations and multiplicative interactions in PNNs will speed up the learning of higher frequency components. To investigate this question, the authors:- Derive the Neural Tangent Kernel for a simple 2-layer PNN architecture to analyze its spectral properties theoretically. - Conduct experiments with synthetic data, images, and classification tasks to empirically evaluate the spectral bias of PNNs compared to standard networks.- Find both theoretically and empirically that PNNs demonstrate faster learning of higher frequency functions, confirming their hypothesis about the spectral bias.So in summary, the key research question is to understand and characterize the spectral bias of PNNs, quantifying how much faster they can learn high frequency components compared to standard neural networks. This provides new insights into the benefits of using polynomial activations and multiplicative interactions in neural network design.
