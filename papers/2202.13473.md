# [The Spectral Bias of Polynomial Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13473)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question that this paper addresses is: What is the spectral bias of polynomial neural networks (PNNs), and how does it compare to standard neural networks? Specifically, the paper investigates whether PNNs exhibit a bias towards learning higher frequency functions faster compared to standard neural networks, which have been shown to have a bias towards learning lower frequency functions. The authors hypothesize that the use of polynomial activations and multiplicative interactions in PNNs will speed up the learning of higher frequency components. To investigate this question, the authors:- Derive the Neural Tangent Kernel for a simple 2-layer PNN architecture to analyze its spectral properties theoretically. - Conduct experiments with synthetic data, images, and classification tasks to empirically evaluate the spectral bias of PNNs compared to standard networks.- Find both theoretically and empirically that PNNs demonstrate faster learning of higher frequency functions, confirming their hypothesis about the spectral bias.So in summary, the key research question is to understand and characterize the spectral bias of PNNs, quantifying how much faster they can learn high frequency components compared to standard neural networks. This provides new insights into the benefits of using polynomial activations and multiplicative interactions in neural network design.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper analyses the spectral bias of polynomial neural networks (PNNs), in particular the Pi-Net family of PNNs. The main contributions are:- They derive the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for a two-layer Pi-Net and analyze its spectral properties. They show theoretically that the eigenvalues of the Pi-Net NTK decay slower compared to standard neural networks, implying faster learning of higher frequencies. - They validate this theoretical result with experiments on learning spherical harmonics in the infinite width NTK regime. Pi-Nets converge faster on higher frequency spherical harmonics compared to standard networks.- Beyond the NTK regime, they demonstrate through several experiments that Pi-Nets exhibit an enhanced bias towards higher frequencies. This is shown on synthetic 1D learning tasks, image denoising and generation using convolutional Pi-Nets, and label noise experiments on classification. - Overall, the spectral analysis and extensive experiments provide insights into why Pi-Nets and polynomial networks in general have shown strong performance on tasks relying on high-frequency visual information, such as image generation and face recognition. The analysis reveals their inherent bias towards higher frequencies compared to standard neural networks.In summary, the key contribution is the theoretical and empirical analysis showing that polynomial networks speed up learning of high frequency functions, providing useful insights into their strong performance on vision tasks. The spectral perspective offers a new viewpoint on the benefits of incorporating multiplicative interactions and polynomials into neural architectures.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel analysis of the spectral properties of polynomial neural networks (PNNs), specifically the Pi-Net family of models. It makes several key contributions:- It derives the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for a simple 2-layer Pi-Net model. By analyzing the kernel's spectral decomposition, it shows theoretically that Pi-Nets exhibit faster learning of higher frequency functions compared to standard neural networks. - It provides extensive experiments validating this theoretical "spectral bias" towards higher frequencies for Pi-Nets, ranging from synthetic data to image datasets. The experiments go beyond the strict NTK regime to show the benefits hold more generally.- The analysis sheds light on why Pi-Nets and other networks with multiplicative interactions have achieved strong results on tasks relying on high-frequency visual information like generation and recognition. This spectral characterization of Pi-Nets' inductive biases is novel. Prior work analyzed the spectral bias of standard neural networks, showing a low frequency bias that this work contrasts. Other theoretical work studied polynomial networks but not from a spectral perspective.The analysis aligns with and provides a theoretical grounding for the empirical success of multiplicative interactions in vision domains. It also suggests architectural guidelines and areas for future work like studying generalization. Overall, the paper offers useful new insights into designing and analyzing networks incorporating polynomials and multiplicative connections.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest a few future research directions based on their work:- Extending the spectral analysis to polynomials of higher degree and depth. In this work, they focused on analyzing two-layer polynomial networks, but the analysis does not easily extend to deeper architectures. Developing techniques to analyze deeper polynomial networks could provide further insights.- Studying how the spectral bias affects performance in large-scale conditional generative models for tasks like image generation and image deblurring. Since these tasks rely heavily on high-frequency information, the spectral bias of polynomials could have significant practical impacts that should be explored. - Investigating differences in generalization behavior between standard neural networks and polynomial networks. The spectral bias towards higher complexity functions exhibited by polynomials may affect their generalization properties in ways that should be better understood.- Analyzing the smoothness of decision boundaries learned by polynomial networks, especially in contexts like adversarial robustness and knowledge distillation. The faster learning of high frequency variations observed in the classification experiments suggests looking into how the decision boundaries differ.- Designing specialized architectures, objectives and training procedures that are cognizant of and can exploit the spectral bias properties of polynomial networks. The theoretical analysis provides insights that could guide novel neural architecture designs and training algorithms.In summary, the authors recommend further theoretical and empirical work to better understand the spectral properties of polynomial networks and use these insights to improve performance in practical deep learning applications.
