# [Is attention to bounding boxes all you need for pedestrian action   prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: Can attention to bounding boxes alone (without other context features) lead to good performance on pedestrian action prediction?The paper proposes Transformer-based models that use only bounding box coordinates as input features to predict whether a pedestrian will cross the street or not. The central hypothesis appears to be that attention to bounding box dynamics over time is sufficient to make accurate predictions, without needing additional context like images, pose, vehicle speed, etc. The authors evaluate their Transformer models on two datasets and find they can achieve state-of-the-art performance using bounding boxes alone. They also conduct a human experiment that shows people can make decent predictions from bounding box dynamics. This supports their hypothesis that attention to bounding boxes contains useful signals for action prediction.In summary, the central research question seems to be whether bounding box attention alone is enough for pedestrian action prediction. The paper aims to demonstrate the sufficiency of this approach through strong model performance and supporting behavioral experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing multiple Transformer-based models (Encoder-only, Encoder-Pooling, Encoder-Decoder) for predicting whether a pedestrian will cross the street in front of an autonomous vehicle, using only bounding box coordinates as input. 2. Introducing a large simulated dataset called CP2A using the CARLA driving simulator, containing around 14 million bounding box samples. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the Transformer models.3. Showing that the proposed Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results on the real-world PIE pedestrian intention estimation dataset, outperforming prior methods using more complex input features like poses, images etc. The best model (Encoder-Decoder) achieves 91% accuracy.4. Demonstrating the benefits of transfer learning - pretraining the Transformer model on the large CP2A dataset boosts performance when fine-tuned on the smaller PIE dataset.5. Conducting a "human attention to bounding boxes" experiment that shows humans can also predict pedestrian crossing intention fairly accurately from bounding boxes alone. This supports the potential of the Transformer models.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing Transformer-based models for pedestrian action prediction that achieve excellent performance using only bounding box inputs, as demonstrated through experiments on real and simulated datasets. The transfer learning results and human experiment further validate the potential of this approach.
