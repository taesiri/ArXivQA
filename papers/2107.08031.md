# [Is attention to bounding boxes all you need for pedestrian action   prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: Can attention to bounding boxes alone (without other context features) lead to good performance on pedestrian action prediction?The paper proposes Transformer-based models that use only bounding box coordinates as input features to predict whether a pedestrian will cross the street or not. The central hypothesis appears to be that attention to bounding box dynamics over time is sufficient to make accurate predictions, without needing additional context like images, pose, vehicle speed, etc. The authors evaluate their Transformer models on two datasets and find they can achieve state-of-the-art performance using bounding boxes alone. They also conduct a human experiment that shows people can make decent predictions from bounding box dynamics. This supports their hypothesis that attention to bounding boxes contains useful signals for action prediction.In summary, the central research question seems to be whether bounding box attention alone is enough for pedestrian action prediction. The paper aims to demonstrate the sufficiency of this approach through strong model performance and supporting behavioral experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing multiple Transformer-based models (Encoder-only, Encoder-Pooling, Encoder-Decoder) for predicting whether a pedestrian will cross the street in front of an autonomous vehicle, using only bounding box coordinates as input. 2. Introducing a large simulated dataset called CP2A using the CARLA driving simulator, containing around 14 million bounding box samples. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the Transformer models.3. Showing that the proposed Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art results on the real-world PIE pedestrian intention estimation dataset, outperforming prior methods using more complex input features like poses, images etc. The best model (Encoder-Decoder) achieves 91% accuracy.4. Demonstrating the benefits of transfer learning - pretraining the Transformer model on the large CP2A dataset boosts performance when fine-tuned on the smaller PIE dataset.5. Conducting a "human attention to bounding boxes" experiment that shows humans can also predict pedestrian crossing intention fairly accurately from bounding boxes alone. This supports the potential of the Transformer models.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing Transformer-based models for pedestrian action prediction that achieve excellent performance using only bounding box inputs, as demonstrated through experiments on real and simulated datasets. The transfer learning results and human experiment further validate the potential of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes Transformer-based models using only pedestrian bounding box coordinates as input that achieve state-of-the-art performance on pedestrian action prediction, introduces a large simulated dataset for pre-training, and shows that humans can also predict pedestrian actions well from bounding boxes alone.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a Transformer-based model for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions using only bounding box inputs. Here are some key points on how it compares to other related work:- Most prior work uses additional input features like pose, images, speed etc. along with bounding boxes. This paper shows that using just bounding boxes as input can achieve state-of-the-art results on pedestrian action prediction.- It proposes multiple Transformer model architectures (encoder-only, encoder-pooling, encoder-decoder) and shows they outperform prior LSTM and attention models using the same bounding box inputs. This highlights the superiority of Transformers for this task.- The paper introduces a large-scale simulated dataset CP2A using CARLA for pre-training. Most prior work uses smaller real-world datasets like PIE. Pre-training on CP2A is shown to improve performance when fine-tuning on PIE.- Transformers have been explored before for trajectory forecasting but not extensively for pedestrian action prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive set of experiments benchmarking Transformers for this problem.- The "human attention to bounding boxes" experiment is novel and provides an interesting analysis to validate the claim that bounding boxes alone can be predictive of pedestrian actions.Overall, the use of Transformers, the CP2A dataset, transfer learning experiments and human experiments make several new contributions compared to prior work in pedestrian action prediction. The results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of using just bounding boxes with Transformers for this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing Transformer models that can better capture useful features from complex, chaotic, or low resolution images/videos. The authors note that their model performs well using just bounding boxes, but other recent work has struggled to effectively apply Transformers to raw images. More research is needed on how to extract the most useful visual features.- Exploring additional simulated datasets for pre-training and transfer learning. The authors show benefits from using their large simulated CP2A dataset. They suggest creating more high-quality simulated pedestrian datasets could further improve action prediction performance when fine-tuned on real datasets.- Testing the generalizability of the models to new datasets. The authors demonstrate strong results on PIE and their CP2A datasets, but additional benchmarking on diverse real-world pedestrian datasets would be useful.- Incorporating additional modalities beyond bounding boxes. Though bounding boxes alone proved very effective, fusing other inputs like vehicle speed, pedestrian poses, etc. could provide additional gains.- Adapting the models to make probabilistic multi-modal predictions. The current work focuses on binary crossing/not-crossing prediction, but predicting a distribution over possible trajectories could be useful.- Reducing model complexity and inference time for real-time applications. The Transformer models are computationally intensive, so research on distillation or efficiency improvements would be valuable.In summary, the main suggested directions are improving visual feature extraction, leveraging simulated data, testing generalizability, incorporating multimodal data, enabling multi-modal predictions, and optimizing for efficiency. Advances in these areas could help make Transformer-based pedestrian action prediction even more accurate and deployable.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Transformer-based models for predicting whether a pedestrian will cross the street in front of an autonomous vehicle. The models take as input only bounding box coordinates of pedestrians over a sequence of frames. Three model architectures are presented: Encoder-Only, Encoder-Pooling, and Encoder-Decoder. The models are evaluated on the PIE pedestrian dataset and achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods that use additional pose, image, and speed data. The best model, the Encoder-Decoder Transformer, achieves 91% accuracy and 0.83 F1 score using just bounding boxes. The authors also introduce a large simulated dataset called CP2A using the CARLA simulator. When pre-trained on this dataset and fine-tuned on PIE, the models achieve further performance gains. Additionally, the authors conduct a human experiment that shows people are reasonably good at predicting pedestrian crossing behavior from bounding boxes alone. This supports the Transformer model's ability to make predictions without environmental context. In summary, this paper shows Transformer models using only bounding box inputs can effectively anticipate pedestrian actions, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. The models are further improved via pre-training on a large simulated dataset and human experiments provide additional validation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes Transformer-based models for predicting whether a pedestrian will cross the street in front of an autonomous vehicle. The models take as input only the bounding box coordinates of pedestrians over a 0.5 second observation period and predict crossing probability 1-2 seconds into the future. The authors experiment with three Transformer architectures: Encoder-Only, which applies pooling layers to the encoder output for prediction; Encoder-Pooling, which gradually reduces sequence length via pooling after each encoder layer; and Encoder-Decoder, which jointly learns to predict crossing action and future trajectory. The models are evaluated on the PIE dataset and a new simulated CP2A dataset. The Encoder-Decoder model achieves the best performance, reaching 91% accuracy on PIE. Transfer learning from the large CP2A dataset to PIE is also shown to boost performance. Overall, the Transformer models using only bounding boxes are able to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods using additional features like pose, vehicle speed, and imagery.
