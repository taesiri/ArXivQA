# [Is attention to bounding boxes all you need for pedestrian action   prediction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08031)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: Can attention to bounding boxes alone (without other context features) lead to good performance on pedestrian action prediction?The paper proposes Transformer-based models that use only bounding box coordinates as input features to predict whether a pedestrian will cross the street or not. The central hypothesis appears to be that attention to bounding box dynamics over time is sufficient to make accurate predictions, without needing additional context like images, pose, vehicle speed, etc. The authors evaluate their Transformer models on two datasets and find they can achieve state-of-the-art performance using bounding boxes alone. They also conduct a human experiment that shows people can make decent predictions from bounding box dynamics. This supports their hypothesis that attention to bounding boxes contains useful signals for action prediction.In summary, the central research question seems to be whether bounding box attention alone is enough for pedestrian action prediction. The paper aims to demonstrate the sufficiency of this approach through strong model performance and supporting behavioral experiments.
