# [Does Visual Self-Supervision Improve Learning of Speech Representations   for Emotion Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01400)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can visual self-supervision improve learning of speech representations for emotion recognition? More specifically, the paper investigates whether using visual information (face reconstruction) during self-supervised pretraining can guide the learning of better audio features for speech and emotion recognition tasks. The key hypotheses are:1) Visual self-supervision by face reconstruction will produce audio features that correlate with lip movements and facial expressions. 2) These visual-guided audio features will outperform standard audio self-supervision methods for emotion recognition, by capturing useful information related to facial expressions.3) Combining visual and audio self-supervision through multi-task learning will yield the most robust and informative audio representations.4) Self-supervised pretraining will offer benefits like preventing overfitting and enabling better performance on smaller datasets compared to standard supervised training.So in summary, the central research question is whether and how visual self-supervision can improve audio representations for speech and specifically emotion recognition, which the paper aims to address through audiovisual pretraining and multi-task learning. The key hypothesis is that the visual modality contains useful signals that can guide better learning of audio features.
