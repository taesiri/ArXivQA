# [Does Visual Self-Supervision Improve Learning of Speech Representations   for Emotion Recognition?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01400)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:Can visual self-supervision improve learning of speech representations for emotion recognition? More specifically, the paper investigates whether using visual information (face reconstruction) during self-supervised pretraining can guide the learning of better audio features for speech and emotion recognition tasks. The key hypotheses are:1) Visual self-supervision by face reconstruction will produce audio features that correlate with lip movements and facial expressions. 2) These visual-guided audio features will outperform standard audio self-supervision methods for emotion recognition, by capturing useful information related to facial expressions.3) Combining visual and audio self-supervision through multi-task learning will yield the most robust and informative audio representations.4) Self-supervised pretraining will offer benefits like preventing overfitting and enabling better performance on smaller datasets compared to standard supervised training.So in summary, the central research question is whether and how visual self-supervision can improve audio representations for speech and specifically emotion recognition, which the paper aims to address through audiovisual pretraining and multi-task learning. The key hypothesis is that the visual modality contains useful signals that can guide better learning of audio features.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Investigating visual self-supervision through facial reconstruction as a way to learn improved audio representations for speech and emotion recognition. The idea is that reconstructing a face video from just audio will force the audio features to encode information about lip movements and facial expressions.2. Proposing two audio-only self-supervised methods based on temporal order verification and combining them with the visual self-supervision method through multi-task learning. This allows encoding complementary information from both modalities. 3. Showing that the proposed audiovisual self-supervision method outperforms existing audio-only self-supervised baselines as well as fully supervised training on multiple speech and emotion recognition tasks.4. Demonstrating the robustness of the learned features under varying noise levels and pretraining dataset sizes. 5. Highlighting the utility of self-supervised pretraining, especially in limited labeled data scenarios common in affective computing. The pretrained models serve as better initializations compared to random initialization.In summary, the key contribution is using cross-modal self-supervision through facial reconstruction to guide the learning of speech audio features that contain information about visual lip movements and facial expressions. This allows learning robust and generalized audio representations that outperform other methods.
