## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework called DemoCaricature to democratize caricature generation by enabling non-experts to easily create personalized caricatures. The key idea is to take a portrait photo depicting a person's identity and a freehand abstract sketch capturing the desired style/shape, and generate a caricature reflecting both. The technical approach involves single-image fine-tuning of a text-to-image Stable Diffusion model to adapt it to the identity image, combined with a sketch adapter module for shape control. A novel Explicit Rank-1 Model Editing method and Random Mask Reconstruction are introduced to balance identity preservation and creative abstraction, while avoiding overfitting to the limited training data. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the approach's superior ability over existing caricature synthesis techniques to harmonize the identity and style concepts from separate reference images within the output caricature. The aim is to eliminate accessibility barriers and empower enthusiasts to engage with caricature artistry, rather than replace expert artists.
