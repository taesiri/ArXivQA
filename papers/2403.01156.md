# [Auxiliary Tasks Enhanced Dual-affinity Learning for Weakly Supervised   Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01156)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to generate coarse pseudo-segmentation labels using only image-level labels. However, CAMs only highlight the most discriminative object parts and thus cannot provide accurate object localization. To mitigate this, previous works used off-the-shelf saliency maps to differentiate objects from backgrounds when generating pseudo-labels. However, these saliency maps were only used in an offline heuristic thresholding process and not further exploited. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes AuxSegNet+, a multi-task learning framework with two auxiliary tasks - saliency detection and image classification - to help improve the main task of semantic segmentation. A novel cross-task dual-affinity learning module is introduced to model both pairwise and unary affinities using the saliency and segmentation features. The affinities are used to:
(1) Enrich features and refine predictions for both tasks
(2) Refine CAMs to generate better pseudo-labels  
(3) Enable iterative improvements via alternating network training and pseudo-label updating

Main Contributions:
- A multi-task learning framework utilizing two auxiliary tasks and cross-task affinity learning to improve weakly supervised semantic segmentation
- A cross-task dual-affinity learning module to model both pairwise and unary affinities across tasks to enhance features, predictions and pseudo-labels
- Iterative improvements in segmentation performance by alternating network training and pseudo-label updating enabled by more reliable cross-task affinities
- State-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, outperforming existing methods.

The key novelty is in modeling and exploiting cross-task dual affinities across saliency detection and semantic segmentation to mutually enhance both tasks and iteratively improve segmentation performance with only image-level labels.
