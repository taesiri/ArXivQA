# [RepQuant: Towards Accurate Post-Training Quantization of Large   Transformer Models via Scale Reparameterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05628)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Quantizing large transformer models is challenging due to the extreme distributions in unique components like LayerNorm and Softmax activations. Existing post-training quantization (PTQ) methods adhere to hardware-compatible quantizers during quantization, which introduces large quantization error. This results in significant performance degradation, especially in low-precision settings like 4-bit quantization.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a PTQ framework called RepQuant that decouples the quantization and inference processes. In the quantization process, it employs complex quantizers tailored to the extreme distributions to minimize quantization error. In the inference process, it uses simplified hardware-friendly quantizers to ensure efficiency. The two processes are explicitly connected via a novel technique called scale reparameterization.

Specifically, for LayerNorm activations with severe inter-channel variations, RepQuant initially applies channel-wise quantization and then reparameterizes it to layer-wise quantization. This transformation maintains quantization accuracy while enabling efficient arithmetic. 

Similarly for Softmax activations with power-law characteristics, RepQuant first uses log√2 quantization and then reparameterizes it to log2 quantization, exploiting the mathematical equivalence between the two.

Additionally, a per-channel dual clipping method is introduced to efficiently eliminate outliers in LayerNorm activations at a fine-grained level. Quantized weight reconstruction is also integrated for further performance improvement.


Main Contributions:
- Proposes a quantization-inference decoupling paradigm for transformer quantization to allow using complex and simple quantizers in the two processes respectively.
- Introduces the technique of scale reparameterization to transform between complex and simple quantizers, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency.  
- Tailors the quantizers specifically for LayerNorm and Softmax activations to handle their extreme distributions.
- Develops a per-channel dual clipping method to accurately eliminate outliers at a fine-grained channel level.
- Evaluates RepQuant extensively on vision, language and multi-modal transformers, demonstrating significant quantization performance and robustness.
