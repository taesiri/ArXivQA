# [Perception and Semantic Aware Regularization for Sequential Confidence   Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19498)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the calibration of deep sequence recognition (DSR) models. The key hypothesis is that incorporating perceptually and semantically similar sequences as additional supervision signals during training can help regulate the overconfidence of DSR models and achieve better calibration.

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1) Tokens/sequences that are perceptually similar (in visual/auditory features) to the target sequence are often confused by the model and assigned overly confident predictions. Regularizing with these sequences can improve perceptual discrimination. 

2) Sequences that are semantically/contextually similar to the target sequence also receive overconfident predictions. Regularizing with these sequences can teach the model about alternative valid sequences.

3) The degree of overconfidence varies across samples based on difficulty. Adaptively modulating the regularization intensity based on sample hardness can improve calibration across easy and difficult examples.

The proposed Perception and Semantic aware Sequence Regularization (PSSR) method implements this hypothesis by constructing perceptually and semantically similar sequence sets for each sample, and using them to regularize the training in an adaptive manner. Experiments on scene text recognition and speech recognition verify that PSSR effectively calibrates DSR models and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies two causes of overconfidence in deep sequence recognition (DSR) models - perception similarity and semantic correlation of sequences. 

2. It proposes a Perception and Semantic aware Sequence Regularization (PSSR) framework to mitigate overconfidence in DSR models. PSSR incorporates perceptually and semantically similar sequences as regularization during training.

3. It introduces an adaptive calibration intensity module based on sample difficulty to achieve finer-grained regularization.

4. It provides comprehensive experiments on scene text recognition and speech recognition tasks, showing that PSSR improves calibration and sets new state-of-the-art results. 

5. It also demonstrates the benefits of PSSR for the downstream task of active learning.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel regularization method to calibrate DSR models by exploiting perception and semantic similarities between sequences. This improves calibration while maintaining accuracy across various models, datasets and tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Perception and Semantic aware Sequence Regularization (PSSR) to improve the calibration and reduce the overconfidence of deep sequence recognition models by incorporating additional perception similarity and semantic correlation information during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in scene text recognition and neural network calibration:

- The paper focuses on improving the calibration (confidence estimation) of deep neural network models for sequence recognition tasks like scene text recognition. Poor calibration is a known issue for neural networks, but prior calibration research has focused more on image classification.

- The authors identify two causes of overconfidence in sequence recognition models - perception similarity (visually similar characters) and semantic correlation (semantically related word sequences). This provides useful insight into the specific issues with sequence model calibration.

- The proposed methods build on prior label smoothing techniques for calibration, but adapt them to leverage perception and semantic similarities to provide better regularization. The adaptive calibration intensity is also a novel way to account for sample difficulty.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art calibration performance on major scene text recognition benchmarks as well as on speech recognition. The consistent gains across different models and datasets demonstrate the broad applicability of the approach.

- The work is one of the first to carefully study and address calibration for sequence recognition models. The analysis of different decoding schemes (CTC vs attention) is also insightful. The gains on downstream active learning validate the utility of better calibration.

In summary, this paper makes excellent progress on an understudied but important problem, with innovations in the analysis, proposed techniques, and breadth of experimental evaluation. It significantly advances the state-of-the-art in confidence calibration for deep sequence models.
