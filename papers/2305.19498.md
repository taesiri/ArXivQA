# [Perception and Semantic Aware Regularization for Sequential Confidence   Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19498)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the calibration of deep sequence recognition (DSR) models. The key hypothesis is that incorporating perceptually and semantically similar sequences as additional supervision signals during training can help regulate the overconfidence of DSR models and achieve better calibration.

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1) Tokens/sequences that are perceptually similar (in visual/auditory features) to the target sequence are often confused by the model and assigned overly confident predictions. Regularizing with these sequences can improve perceptual discrimination. 

2) Sequences that are semantically/contextually similar to the target sequence also receive overconfident predictions. Regularizing with these sequences can teach the model about alternative valid sequences.

3) The degree of overconfidence varies across samples based on difficulty. Adaptively modulating the regularization intensity based on sample hardness can improve calibration across easy and difficult examples.

The proposed Perception and Semantic aware Sequence Regularization (PSSR) method implements this hypothesis by constructing perceptually and semantically similar sequence sets for each sample, and using them to regularize the training in an adaptive manner. Experiments on scene text recognition and speech recognition verify that PSSR effectively calibrates DSR models and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods.
