# [Extensible Hook System for Rendesvouz and Docking of a Cubesat Swarm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18376)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Using cubesat swarms for missions like debris removal and space-based solar power requires the cubesats to rendezvous and dock with each other, which is challenging due to the fuel and complexity requirements. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes an extensible hook system (EHS) based on a scissor boom structure to connect and assemble cubesat swarms while saving fuel. 
- The EHS has 3 degrees of freedom and can extend up to 5 meters to grab and connect cubesats from up to 10 meters away.  
- Permanent and electromagnets on the end effector allow the EHS to dock with other EHSs on target cubesats.

Main Contributions:
- Concept and initial design of an EHS for cubesat swarms to enable rendezvous and docking while saving fuel during approach and formation flight stages.  
- Proposed GNC architecture with 3-level navigation for long, medium and short range localization accuracy needs.
- Guidance requires complex coordinated motion planning for the swarm. 
- Control needs advanced techniques like MPC and gain scheduling to handle EHS non-linearities.
- Dynamics simulations obtained feasibility results in terms of actuation requirements for both cubesat maneuvering and EHS deployment.

In summary, the paper explores the concept, design and dynamics of using an extensible hook system to enable rendezvous, docking and formation flight of cubesat swarms while saving propellant, which is critical for longer duration missions. The feasibility is shown via simulations while further work on guidance, navigation and control is identified as needed for realization.
