# [AM-RADIO: Agglomerative Model -- Reduce All Domains Into One](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06709)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Several powerful vision foundation models (VFMs) like CLIP, DINOv2, SAM have recently emerged. These models are trained on different objectives and exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses on various downstream tasks. 
- It is desirable to combine their unique capabilities into a single model that outperforms individual ones. However, training such a model from scratch would be very expensive. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AM-RADIO, an efficient knowledge agglomeration framework to train a student vision encoder via multi-teacher distillation. 
- The teachers are CLIP (for zero-shot vision-language capabilities), DINOv2 (for dense correspondence), and SAM (for segmentation).
- The student is trained to match intermediate features from each teacher model using task-specific projection heads, without any labels. This allows combining their complementary strengths.

Main Contributions:
- Show that AM-RADIO student models can outperform all teachers on most metrics including ImageNet classification, ADE20k segmentation, COCO detection, and LLaVa question answering.
- Demonstrate the student can directly replace teachers in their frameworks, e.g. enable zero-shot classification like CLIP and segment-anything capabilities like SAM.
- Benchmark several efficient architectures for replacing expensive ViT encoders, and propose a novel CNN-Transformer hybrid E-RADIO that is 7x faster than teachers while achieving similar performance. 
- The distillation framework is very efficient, consuming only 2-5% of the data required for training foundations models like CLIP from scratch.

In summary, the paper presents an effective approach to unite complementary capabilities of multiple vision foundation models into a single performant and efficient student network via multi-teacher distillation.
