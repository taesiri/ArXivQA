# [Aligning Modalities in Vision Large Language Models via Preference   Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) fuse pre-trained vision and language models, achieving strong performance on vision-language tasks. However, they suffer from "hallucinations" - generating content not grounded in the actual image.

- A key reason is the lack of alignment between image and text modalities in VLLMs. Prior preference learning methods rely on generating both preferred and dispreferred text, but both may be incorrect in VLLMs. This makes aligning to the correct image-text pairing difficult.

Method: 
- Proposes "Preference Optimization in VLLM with AI-Generated Dispreferences" (\ours) to align modalities. 

- Uses ground truth text as preferred, and two strategies to generate dispreferred:
   1) Manipulate ground truth via GPT-4V to inject plausible hallucinations
   2) Introduce noise into images to trigger inherent VLLM hallucination patterns

- Integrates both dispreferred strategies into RLHF optimization via Direct Preference Optimization to explicitly contrast truthful and hallucinatory responses.

Contributions:
- Automated dispreference generation approach without human labeling efforts, easily scalable
- Empirically reduces hallucinations and improves overall VLLM performance across benchmarks
- Analysis shows redirected attention towards images, indicating enhanced image-text modality alignment

The key advantage is the automated dispreference generation to effectively fine-tune VLLMs, mitigating hallucinations and boosting performance by aligning modalities. The empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to existing preference learning techniques.
