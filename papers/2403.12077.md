# [Evaluating Robustness of Generative Search Engine on Adversarial Factual   Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Generative search engines backed by large language models (LLMs) have potential to transform online information seeking. However, generated responses may not always be accurate, leading to "hallucinations".  
- Adversarial manipulations of input could exploit vulnerabilities and induce incorrect or misleading responses from these systems. 
- Assessing robustness to such adversarial attacks is critical before broad deployment of generative search engines.

Methods:
- Authors devise 7 diverse adversarial attack strategies to subtly manipulate factual accuracy of input sentences:
    - Multihop Extension
    - Temporal Modification 
    - Semantic Replacement
    - Distraction Injection
    - Facts Exaggeration
    - Facts Reversal
    - Numerical Manipulation
- Attacks applied to leading generative search engines (Bing Chat, PerplexityAI, YouChat) and 3 LLMs (Gemini, GPT-3.5, GPT-4). 
- Performance evaluated using accuracy rates, factscore, fluency, utility, citation quality metrics.

Key Findings:  
- Adversarial factual questions highly effective at inducing incorrect responses across models, with average attack success rate of 25.1%.  
- Search engines more susceptible than standalone LLMs, with higher attack success rates.
- Weaknesses exist in contextual understanding and numerical reasoning.
- Results underscore need for rigorous evaluation and improvement of robustness before deployment.  

Contributions:
- First comprehensive robustness evaluation of leading generative search engines against adversarial input manipulation.
- Analysis highlights vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art models backing these systems.
- Emphasizes critical importance of safety mechanisms to mitigate risks as models integrate into sensitive, complex environments.

Limitations:
- Focus only on factual questions, further assessments needed for other query types.  
- No analysis on open-sourced LLMs like LLaMA.

Does this help summarize the key ideas and contributions of the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
