# [Video Probabilistic Diffusion Models in Projected Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07685)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to develop an efficient video generative model that can synthesize high-quality, realistic videos. Specifically, the paper aims to address the key challenges in video generation of handling the high dimensionality and complexity of video data while being scalable and computationally efficient. 

The main hypothesis is that representing videos in a low-dimensional latent space and modeling the distribution with diffusion models can lead to an effective and efficient generative model for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis. The key ideas are:

1) Designing an autoencoder to project videos into a low-dimensional latent space with three 2D image-like latent vectors instead of a 3D tensor. This factorization allows efficiently capturing the spatial and temporal variations. 

2) Developing a diffusion model architecture specialized for the proposed latent space that relies on 2D convolutions instead of 3D, enabling efficient training and sampling. 

3) Jointly training the model to generate arbitrary length videos by learning unconditional generation of clips and conditional generation between consecutive clips.

Overall, the central hypothesis is that the proposed projected latent space paired with an efficient diffusion model architecture can enable scalable, high-quality video synthesis while overcoming the computation and memory bottlenecks of prior video generative models. The experiments aim to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model called Projected Latent Video Diffusion Model (PVDM).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel latent diffusion model called Projected Latent Video Diffusion Model (PVDM) for efficient and high-quality video generation. The key ideas are:

- An autoencoder that projects a video into three 2D image-like latent vectors by factorizing the complex 3D structure of videos. This allows efficient diffusion model design. 

- A diffusion model architecture specialized for the 2D latent space that avoids 3D convolutions and enables video generation under limited compute.

- A training strategy for the diffusion model to generate videos of arbitrary lengths.

Specifically, the autoencoder projects the video along each axis into 2D latents to capture common contents, vertical motion, and horizontal motion. The diffusion model is designed with 2D convolutions on the image-like latents. It is trained to model the joint distributions of unconditional and conditional generation. This allows generating longer videos by conditioning on previous frames.

Experiments show PVDM improves efficiency and video quality over prior arts. For example, it reduces the FVD score by 1773 on a 128-frame UCF-101 benchmark and improves Inception Score to 74.4. It also has lower memory requirements and faster sampling than recent video diffusion models.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient latent diffusion model for high-quality and scalable video synthesis, enabled by novel projected 2D latent representations of videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Projected Latent Video Diffusion Model (PVDM), a novel generative model for efficient high-resolution long video synthesis that represents videos with 2D image-like latent vectors and trains a diffusion model in this low-dimensional latent space to avoid computation bottlenecks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in video generative modeling:

- It focuses on latent diffusion models for video generation, which is a relatively new approach compared to other popular techniques like GANs and autoregressive models. Only a few recent papers have explored video diffusion models.

- It proposes representing videos in a novel 2D latent space ("triplane" projections) instead of typical 3D latent representations. This is a unique approach that aims to improve computational and memory efficiency compared to typical 3D latent spaces.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on common video generation benchmarks like UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse datasets. The proposed model outperforms prior work on metrics like IS, FVD, and qualitative assessment.

- The model shows superior efficiency compared to other recent video diffusion models in terms of computation time, memory requirements, and ability to generate high resolution, long videos. This addresses a key limitation of current video diffusion models.

- The framework allows generating variable length videos with a single model, unlike most prior work that generates fixed length clips. This is an important capability for real-world video generation.

- The autoencoder and diffusion model components draw heavily from image generation techniques (2D CNNs, Transformers), adapting these ideas to the video domain. This differs from other works that design custom 3D architectures.

Overall, this work pushes state-of-the-art in video generation through a novel latent space design and diffusion modeling approach. The core ideas around triplane projections and computational efficiency help advance video diffusion models. Key limitations are lack of large-scale video experiments and text-to-video capabilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Designing diffusion model architectures specialized for the triplane latents proposed in this work, in order to model the latent distributions even better. The authors mention this could be an interesting direction for further improving their framework.

- Investigating alternative latent structures beyond the triplane idea presented here, that may enable encoding videos even more efficiently. The authors indicate their triplane latent representation shows promise, but other latent structures could be explored.

- Scaling up the experiments to large-scale video datasets to evaluate the method on more challenging tasks like text-to-video generation. The authors were limited by compute resources but believe their framework could work well for such tasks.

- Improving the video quality and closing the remaining gap between real and synthesized videos. The authors acknowledge there is still room for progress on the generation quality.

- Exploring conditional video generation tasks beyond the frame-conditional modeling presented here, such as class-conditional generation.

- Investigating the use of the proposed latent diffusion framework for other types of generative video modeling besides unconditional synthesis, such as video prediction, interpolation, etc.

In summary, the main future directions are around designing better model architectures tailored for the triplane latent space, exploring other latent representations, scaling up the experiments, improving video quality, and extending the framework to various conditional tasks and setups beyond unconditional synthesis.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new generative model for high-resolution video synthesis called Projected Latent Video Diffusion Model (PVDM). The key idea is to represent videos in a low-dimensional latent space to enable efficient training and sampling of a diffusion model. The framework has two main components. First, an autoencoder is used to project the video into three 2D image-like latent vectors that capture the spatial and temporal components in a compact form. This avoids dealing with high-dimensional 3D representations. Second, a diffusion model architecture specialized for the 2D latent space is proposed to model the video distribution. It is based on 2D convolutions instead of 3D, improving efficiency. The model can synthesize arbitrary length videos via joint training of unconditional and conditional generation.

Experiments on UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse datasets demonstrate PVDM's effectiveness. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on video generation benchmarks, measured by Inception Score and Frechet Video Distance. Compared to previous video diffusion models, it shows dramatically improved memory and computation efficiency. For example, it requires 17.6x less time to generate a video compared to a prior model. The performance gains stem from the compact latent space design that avoids directly operating on high-dimensional video tensors. Overall, PVDM represents an important step towards scalable, high-quality video synthesis with diffusion models.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel latent diffusion model for video generation called Projected Latent Video Diffusion Model (PVDM). The key idea is to represent videos in a low-dimensional latent space instead of directly operating on the raw pixel space. PVDM has two main components: (1) An autoencoder that projects a video into three 2D image-like latent vectors by factorizing the complex 3D structure of videos. One latent vector encodes the spatial contents across time, and the other two encode the motion across the spatial dimensions. (2) A diffusion model architecture specially designed for the 2D latent space using 2D convolutions instead of 3D. This allows efficient training and sampling of high-resolution, long videos. The autoencoder provides a compressed representation to enable efficient diffusion modeling of videos in latent space. A joint training procedure allows generating arbitrary length videos with a single model. Experiments show PVDM achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality with superior efficiency over raw pixel space video diffusion models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is proposing a new framework for video synthesis using diffusion models. The key problem they aim to address is the computational inefficiency of previous video diffusion models when dealing with high-resolution, long videos. 

Specifically, prior video diffusion models operate directly on the raw pixel space of videos, which are represented as high-dimensional 3D arrays. This makes them very computation and memory intensive to train and sample from. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a novel latent diffusion model framework that works in a low-dimensional latent space rather than directly on the pixels.

The main contributions are:

- They design a video autoencoder that projects videos into a compact latent space of 2D image-like representations rather than a 3D tensor. This is done by factorizing the video into spatial, horizontal, and vertical latent vectors.

- Based on this latent space, they build a specialized diffusion model architecture using 2D convolutions rather than 3D. This allows more efficient training and sampling compared to prior video diffusion models.

- They propose a training approach to jointly learn an unconditional model and conditional model for generating variable length videos in a single framework.

So in summary, the key research question is how to develop an efficient video diffusion model that can synthesize high quality, long videos by representing and modeling videos in a compact latent space rather than directly in pixel space. The proposed projected latent video diffusion model framework aims to solve these challenges.
