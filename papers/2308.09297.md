# [NAPA-VQ: Neighborhood Aware Prototype Augmentation with Vector   Quantization for Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09297)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve class incremental learning in deep neural networks without using exemplars from previous tasks? The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Learning the topological relationships between classes in the feature space and using this neighborhood information can help separate confusing classes and generate better prototypes to reduce catastrophic forgetting.2) Generating augmented prototypes by fusing class-specific and class-shared features of neighboring classes can produce prototypes that lie in uncertain regions, helping the model establish clearer boundaries between old and new classes. 3) Combining the proposed neighborhood-aware vector quantization and prototype augmentation techniques can significantly improve performance on class incremental learning benchmarks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that exploiting neighborhood information both for vector quantization and prototype augmentation can lead to improved class separation and discrimination in non-exemplar class incremental learning. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed NAPA-VQ framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new method called NAPA-VQ for class incremental learning (CIL) that does not rely on storing previous task exemplars to retain old knowledge. The key ideas proposed are:- Using a vector quantization method called Neighborhood-Aware Vector Quantizer (NA-VQ) to learn the topological structure of the feature space and enforce separation between classes that are prone to be confused. This helps reduce representational overlap between classes.- Introducing a prototype augmentation method called Neighborhood-Aware Prototype Augmenter (NA-PA) that generates representative prototypes for old classes by fusing their class-specific features with shared features from their neighboring classes. This helps establish better discrimination between old and new classes. - Combining NA-VQ and NA-PA in an end-to-end framework called NAPA-VQ that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for CIL without using any past exemplars.In summary, the main contribution is a new technique for non-exemplar based class incremental learning that utilizes neighborhood information in the feature space to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The proposed NA-VQ and NA-PA modules allow better discrimination between classes and reduced overlap in the feature representations.
