# [Scientific Preparation for CSST: Classification of Galaxy and   Nebula/Star Cluster Based on Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04948)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a deep learning model called HR-CelestialNet for real-time classification of galaxies and nebulae/star clusters (NSCs) to support astronomical surveys by the upcoming Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). The authors created a Local Celestial Image Dataset (LCID) using over 7800 single-exposure images from Hubble Space Telescope instruments with similar specifications to CSST detectors. HR-CelestialNet is specifically designed for direct high-resolution image recognition, consisting of convolutional and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features followed by fully-connected layers for classification. Experimental results on LCID demonstrated that HR-CelestialNet achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 89.09% and efficient average recognition speed of 116.5ms per sample, outperforming AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet models. Additional testing on blurry images showed HR-CelestialNet's superior robustness in classifying degraded celestial images, albeit with reduced accuracy. Design advantages, performance metrics, hardware requirements and error analysis of HR-CelestialNet are thoroughly presented and discussed. Overall, HR-CelestialNet offers an effective and rapid solution for onboard categorization of galaxies and NSCs to facilitate CSST's scientific surveys and data analysis.
