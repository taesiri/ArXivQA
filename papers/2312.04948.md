# [Scientific Preparation for CSST: Classification of Galaxy and   Nebula/Star Cluster Based on Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct large-scale astronomical surveys and require real-time identification of galaxies and nebulae/star clusters (NSCs) from captured images. However, partial views of these celestial bodies can be challenging to identify due to morphological similarities between them.
- Existing galaxy/NSC classification models focus on lower resolution images but high resolution CSST images will contain more classification features that should not be lost through downscaling. Models are also needed that can directly handle the high resolution CSST images and identify both local and global features robustly.

Proposed Solution: 
- A Local Celestial Image Dataset (LCID) is built from 7813 Hubble Space Telescope images of 48 galaxies and 23 NSCs. Images undergo specific pre-processing into uniform 2048x4096 sizes.
- A deep convolutional neural network called HR-CelestialNet is designed to directly classify the high resolution galaxy and NSC images in LCID. It has a segmentation focused on larger early feature maps and another focused on smaller later feature maps.
- HR-CelestialNet is compared against AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet models that are fine-tuned for the dataset. Model hardware requirements are also analyzed.

Main Contributions:
- HR-CelestialNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 89.09% on LCID, outperforming the other models, with a balance of effectiveness and efficiency (average 116.5ms/sample).
- Analysis on a LCID-Blurry set shows HR-CelestialNet has optimal 84.48% accuracy, demonstrating its robustness in handling blurred celestial images expected from CSST.
- Factors like inter-class similarity, insufficient features and image noise are identified as reasons for misclassification. 
- The study demonstrates the feasibility of direct high resolution classification of celestial images, which can enable more detailed exploration of astronomical targets in future surveys.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective deep learning solution tailored for directly classifying high resolution galaxy and NSC images expected from CSST while handling various challenges posed by real survey images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a deep learning model called HR-CelestialNet for real-time classification of high-resolution galaxy and nebula/star cluster images captured by the future Chinese Space Station Telescope, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and efficiency compared to AlexNet, VGGNet and ResNet models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1. It proposes a deep learning model called HR-CelestialNet for classifying high-resolution images of galaxies and nebulae/star clusters. HR-CelestialNet achieves higher accuracy (89.09%) compared to other models like AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet on the task of classifying the Local Celestial Image Dataset. It also shows robust performance on blurry images.

2. The paper creates three new datasets - the Local Celestial Image Dataset (LCID), LCID-Resize, and LCID-Blurry. These are collected from Hubble Space Telescope images and serve as benchmarks for training and evaluating models for classifying astronomical images, especially high-resolution local images as expected from the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) HR-CelestialNet model for effective classification of high-resolution celestial images (2) Three new datasets to facilitate research in this area. The models and datasets aim to support real-time analysis during astronomical surveys.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using convolutional kernels of sizes 7x7 and 5x5 in the large-size learning component of HR-CelestialNet. What is the rationale behind using larger kernel sizes in this part of the network? How do larger kernels impact the receptive field and feature learning capability?

2. In the small-size learning component, the authors drew inspiration from VGGNet and used consecutive 3x3 convolutional layers. Why is this an effective strategy for learning discriminative features? How does this compare to using larger kernels?

3. The authors avoided padding in HR-CelestialNet to reduce model parameters. However, padding also allows control over output dimensions. What effect would adding padding have? Would it help capture more contextual features for this classification task?  

4. How was the specific combination of max pooling kernel sizes and strides selected in HR-CelestialNet? What considerations went into balancing downsampling while retaining important features?

5. The classification performance decreases for all models on blurry images. What architectural or data augmentations strategies could make HR-CelestialNet more robust to blur?

6. Could generative models such as GANs be effective for augmenting more training data similar to challenging blurry examples? Why or why not?

7. What other recent advancements in convolutional neural networks could be explored to boost classification accuracy? Could techniques like attention modules, atrous/dilated convolutions etc. help?

8. The paper analyzed misclassified examples arising from inter-class similarity, insufficient features and noise. What data augmentation or loss function modifications could help resolve this?

9. How useful would pre-trained image representations from contrastive self-supervised learning be for this specialized celestial classification task? Could they boost data efficiency?

10. The authors collect image data from Hubble Space Telescope to simulate CSST images. How could simulated CSST images be made more realistic? What domain gaps need to be addressed?
