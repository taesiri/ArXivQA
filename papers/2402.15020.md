# [Probabilistically-sound beam search with masked language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Masked language models (MLMs) like BERT are bidirectional and can model context well, making them useful for domains like protein language modeling and ancient text restoration. 
- However, MLMs only learn conditional distributions over tokens rather than full joint distributions over sequences. This makes tasks like beam search challenging with MLMs.
- Simply approximating the joint distribution using the chain rule (like with autoregressive models) relies on strong independence assumptions that likely don't hold. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use the Hammersley-Clifford-Besag (HCB) theorem to construct a joint distribution from MLM-learned conditional distributions. This relies only on the conditional distributions being "compatible" rather than independent.
- Modify beam search scoring to use the HCB expansion, adding a correction term to account for dependence between tokens and downstream masks.
- This "HCB beam search" approach is probabilistically sound and has almost no additional computational cost over standard MLM beam search.

Key Contributions:
- Clarify theoretical conditions for when standard MLM beam search is sound, relating to low training loss and conditional independence between tokens and masks.
- Introduce HCB beam search which relaxes the independence assumption and demonstrate it improves over standard beam search for BERT-base.
- Empirically show model-dependent tradeoffs between HCB and standard beam search across domains like English NLP, ancient Greek, and protein modeling. 
- Analyze performance over choice of "pivot" sequence in HCB construction and impact of various ablation studies.

In summary, the paper proposes and demonstrates an improved beam search approach for MLMs that is simple to implement but more probabilistically principled compared to prior heuristic approximations to joint distributions.
