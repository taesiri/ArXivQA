# [Triggering Multi-Hop Reasoning for Question Answering in Language Models   using Soft Prompts and Random Walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04009)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can language models be improved at multi-hop reasoning and chaining together multiple facts to answer questions, when they already encode a lot of factual knowledge?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

Training language models on random walks over knowledge graphs can provide a useful signal to improve their ability to compose facts and perform multi-hop reasoning.

In particular, the paper proposes and tests two main methods:

1) Modular Prompts (PaTH): Using separate prompt modules to first parse questions into incomplete random walk queries, and then generate full paths to the answer. 

2) Mixture Training: Jointly training a single prompt on a mixture of QA data and random walk data.

The central goal is to trigger the language models' ability to chain factual knowledge that they already encode, in order to perform better logical reasoning and answer multi-hop questions. The key hypothesis is that learning to map questions to knowledge graph paths provides a useful training signal for this.

In summary, the paper aims to improve language models' multi-hop reasoning abilities by learning to leverage their existing factual knowledge in a more compositional way, using random walks over knowledge graphs as a training signal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the key points regarding the main contribution of this paper:

- The paper focuses on improving the ability of language models like T5 to perform multi-hop reasoning in question answering. This involves composing together multiple facts to answer questions, rather than just relying on single-hop knowledge.

- The main proposal is to use random walks over knowledge graphs as a training signal to teach the language models to chain facts together. The random walks provide paths connecting entities that the model can learn to mimic. 

- Two main methods are proposed to leverage the random walks: 1) A modular approach with separate prompts for parsing and chaining, 2) A joint training approach that mixes QA data and random walks.

- Experiments show substantial gains over standard tuning methods, especially for very large T5 models (T5-XXL). The modular prompt approach performs the best, improving around 16 points over fine-tuning for T5-XXL.

- The main conclusion is that random walks over structured knowledge provide a useful training signal for triggering multi-hop reasoning in large language models. The paper demonstrates improvements on a challenging 2-hop QA dataset using this technique.

In summary, the core contribution is using random walks over knowledge graphs with soft prompts to improve multi-hop reasoning and question answering in large pre-trained language models like T5.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using soft prompts trained on random walks over knowledge graphs to improve the ability of T5 language models to perform multi-hop reasoning and answer compositional questions, showing substantial gains over standard tuning methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on multi-hop reasoning and question answering:

- The focus on training language models (LMs) like T5 to perform multi-hop reasoning using their own internal knowledge is novel compared to other work. Many existing approaches provide additional textual contexts to the model or train separate models to decompose questions.

- Using random walks over knowledge graphs to generate training data is a unique technique. This provides a natural way to chain facts together to answer multi-hop questions. Other work has tried to map questions to knowledge graphs, but the paths are often noisy.

- Applying soft prompting methods to guide models to map questions to random walk paths is effective, especially for larger T5 models. Most prior work uses standard fine-tuning. Soft prompts allow keeping the base model fixed.

- The gains are most significant on a closed-book QA dataset without providing additional contexts to the models. Many existing datasets provide supporting documents, making it unclear if models are truly doing multi-hop reasoning over their internal knowledge.

- The methods are analyzed on a clean dataset with questions explicitly linked to structured knowledge graphs, enabling precise evaluation. Other datasets either lack these links or have noisy/approximate mappings.

- Limitations include only evaluating up to 2-hop reasoning and on a relatively small knowledge graph. More research is still needed to scale up to more hops and realistic world knowledge.

Overall, this work makes good progress on directly enhancing the multi-hop reasoning capabilities of large language models by creatively utilizing knowledge graphs and soft prompting techniques. The analysis is rigorous thanks to the high-quality dataset with clean ground truth paths.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Testing the proposed methods on knowledge graphs larger than the one used in this study (which only had 98K entities and 29 relations). The authors note the trade-off they made between focusing on knowledge composition vs fully encoding world knowledge, and suggest experiments with larger knowledge graphs.

- Applying the methods to tasks/datasets that require more than 2 hops of reasoning. The authors focused on 2-hop questions here, but note their random walk training method could be extended to longer sequences.

- Experimenting with even larger language models, with billions or trillions of parameters. The authors note recent work showing multi-step reasoning emerging in models orders of magnitude larger than T5-XXL. They suggest testing if their methods could further improve such models.

- Augmenting existing QA datasets by linking questions to structured knowledge, to allow testing on those datasets. The authors note they couldn't compare to some popular QA datasets due to lack of structured knowledge linking. They suggest using existing techniques to create noisy links as a way to test the methods on more diverse QA tasks.

- Incorporating aliases for entities in the answer space to handle cases where models predict correct answers in different forms. The authors give an example where models predict nationality as "British" vs ground truth "United Kingdom".

- Further improving the ability to generalize to novel compositions of memorized facts, noting there is still a gap between training and test performance on generating random walks.

- Analyzing the intermediate steps more, like parsing accuracy, as well as eliciting more steps when reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes techniques to improve the ability of large language models (LMs) like T5 to perform multi-hop reasoning and question answering, which requires chaining together multiple facts. The key idea is to leverage random walks over knowledge graphs to provide a useful training signal. Specifically, the authors first integrate single-hop knowledge into T5 models by fine-tuning on knowledge graph triples. However, this alone does not substantially improve performance on multi-hop question answering. The authors then adapt these knowledge-integrated models by training soft prompts on random walks, providing examples of chaining facts. Two methods are proposed: 1) A modular approach with separate prompts for parsing questions into incomplete random walks, and generating complete paths using hopping prompts. 2) A mixture approach that jointly trains a single prompt on QA and random walks. Experiments on two T5 models show that these random walk-based prompting methods substantially improve multi-hop QA over standard tuning approaches, especially for the 11B parameter T5-XXL model. The modular method performs best overall. The gains suggest that larger models are more amenable to leveraging the chaining signal from random walks via soft prompts.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes techniques to improve the ability of large language models (LMs) like T5 to perform multi-hop reasoning in question answering. Multi-hop reasoning requires chaining facts together, which LMs struggle with despite having a lot of world knowledge. The key idea is to leverage random walks over knowledge graphs to provide a useful training signal. Specifically, two T5 LMs are adapted by training soft prompts on random walks so the LMs can map questions to paths leading to the answer entity. One method uses separate prompts for parsing and path generation, while another jointly trains a single prompt on a mixture of QA and path generation. Experiments on a 2-hop QA dataset show substantial gains over regular tuning for the 11B parameter T5-XXL model when using the proposed techniques, demonstrating improved multi-hop reasoning. However, smaller 770M parameter models benefit less, suggesting very large LMs are more amenable to this approach.

In more detail, the paper first encodes prerequisite single-hop knowledge into the LMs using graph triples, but finds this alone doesn't improve multi-hop QA much. Soft prompts are then trained on random walks over the graph to teach LMs to chain facts. Two methods using these prompts are proposed. The modular approach uses separate prompts for parsing questions into partial paths, and completing paths to the answer. The mixture approach combines QA and path generation during training. On 2-hop questions, the modular approach improves an 11B parameter model by 16 points over regular tuning. The mixture approach sees a 9.6 point gain. However, for a smaller 770M parameter model, the gains are smaller and standard tuning outperforms. Overall, the work demonstrates that very large LMs can learn to compose facts better through soft prompt training on knowledge graph walks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes techniques to improve the ability of large language models (LMs) like T5 to perform multi-hop reasoning in question answering. The key idea is to leverage training signals from random walks over knowledge graphs to teach the LMs to chain together facts they have encoded. Specifically, the authors first integrate single-hop factual knowledge into the LMs using existing methods. They then train "hopping prompts" on sequences of entities and relations that resemble random walk paths, teaching the LMs to expand incomplete paths. Two techniques are proposed to apply this to question answering: 1) A modular approach where one prompt parses questions into incomplete paths, and hopping prompts expand them to answer entities. 2) A mixture approach that trains a single prompt on a blend of QA examples and random walk paths. Experiments on T5 models show substantial gains over regular tuning, especially for an 11B parameter model, where the modular approach improves exact match by 16 points over full fine-tuning. The gains suggest that properly utilizing signals from knowledge graph structure can significantly improve language models' multi-hop reasoning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of pre-trained language models struggling to perform multi-hop reasoning and compose factual knowledge, even when they have encoded the required facts. Specifically, the paper focuses on the task of multi-hop question answering, where models need to combine multiple facts to arrive at the answer. 

The key questions/problems the paper investigates are:

- What techniques allow language models to map natural language questions to structured knowledge paths that lead to the answer?

In summary, the paper aims to enhance the multi-hop reasoning and knowledge compositional capabilities of large pre-trained language models by leveraging signals from knowledge graph random walks during training.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two main techniques for improving multi-hop reasoning in LMs using random walks - the modular Parse-then-Hop approach and the MixHop approach. What are the key differences between these two techniques and what are the relative advantages/disadvantages of each?

2. The paper shows that simply integrating single-hop knowledge into LMs is not enough to substantially improve performance on multi-hop QA - multi-hop capabilities need to be explicitly trained. Why do you think this is the case? What are the challenges in getting LMs to compose together facts they have memorized?
