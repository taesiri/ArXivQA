# [BjTT: A Large-scale Multimodal Dataset for Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traffic prediction is important for intelligent transportation systems, but relies heavily on historical traffic data. This is limited in capturing real-world complexities like accidents or weather that impact traffic.
- Existing traffic prediction datasets are mainly unimodal, containing only traffic data. They lack comprehensive data to address limitations in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce BjTT, a large-scale multimodal traffic dataset containing over 32,000 text-traffic pairs spanning 3 months in Beijing.
- Traffic data has 1,260 roads with velocity and congestion levels. Text describes traffic system events like accidents, weather, construction.
- Evaluate state-of-the-art traffic prediction methods on BjTT to analyze performance. Also test a text-guided generative model.

Main Contributions:
- Release the first public multimodal traffic dataset with both timeseries traffic data and textual event descriptions. Uniquely comprehensive.
- BjTT has large volume (32k samples), diverse traffic data types, and new text modality for events. Advances traffic prediction.  
- Comprehensive experiments using BjTT provide benchmarks and analysis for traffic prediction methods. Reveals text can assist prediction.
- BjTT helps address key challenges: insensitivity to events, limited long-term prediction accuracy. Drives future research.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel multimodal traffic dataset BjTT that combines timeseries traffic data with text event descriptions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate BjTT's ability to advance traffic prediction research by providing richer data and revealing limitations to address.
