# [All You Need In Sign Language Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01609)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is on reviewing recent advances in sign language production (SLP) using deep learning techniques. The key goals and contributions of the paper seem to be:- Providing background on sign language, deaf culture, and differences between spoken and sign languages. This gives important context for understanding the challenges in developing SLP systems.- Presenting a taxonomy that categorizes SLP research into different dimensions like input modalities, datasets, applications, and models. This helps structure the review of the literature.- Surveying the state-of-the-art in deep learning techniques for SLP, including convolutional and recurrent neural networks, generative models, motion graphs, and avatar approaches. - Discussing the main datasets used for training and evaluating SLP models. The lack of large-scale SLP datasets is highlighted as a key challenge.- Proposing a general framework for SLP that breaks the problem down into intermediate steps like text-to-gloss and pose-to-video translation.- Summarizing quantitative performance results reported in the literature and analyzing advantages and limitations of different methods.- Identifying promising future research directions such as generating photo-realistic signers, incorporating linguistic knowledge, and addressing multi-signer modeling.So in summary, the main focus is providing a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques and benchmarks for sign language production, while also discussing open challenges and opportunities for advancing the state-of-the-art in this field.
