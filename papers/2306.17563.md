# [Large Language Models are Effective Text Rankers with Pairwise Ranking   Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17563)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis seems to be:

Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can be effective at text ranking tasks using pairwise ranking prompting, without requiring fine-tuning or training data. 

The key points are:

- Existing methods for using LLMs for text ranking, such as pointwise and listwise prompting, have shown limited success. The authors analyze why this is the case.

- The authors propose a new prompting technique called pairwise ranking prompting (PRP) which simplifies the task for the LLM to making relative judgments between pairs of documents.

- The authors evaluate variants of PRP on standard benchmark text ranking datasets, using moderate-sized, open-sourced LLMs without fine-tuning. 

- Their results show that PRP with these LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods based on much larger commercial LLMs.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that pairwise ranking prompting can enable effective zero-shot text ranking with LLMs, which has been a challenge for prior methods. The paper seems to provide evidence supporting this hypothesis through empirical evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new technique called Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) for using large language models (LLMs) to rank documents. PRP simplifies the ranking task for LLMs by framing it as making pairwise comparisons between documents.

2. Showing that PRP can achieve state-of-the-art ranking performance on standard benchmark datasets using moderate-sized, open-sourced LLMs. Specifically, PRP with the 20B parameter FLAN-UL2 model outperforms previous best approaches that use much larger proprietary LLMs on metrics like NDCG@1.  

3. Studying several efficiency improvements to PRP to reduce the number of queries to the LLM while maintaining strong performance. This includes sorting-based and sliding window approaches that can attain linear complexity.

4. Demonstrating benefits of PRP like supporting both generation and scoring LLM APIs and being robust to input ordering of documents.

In summary, the key novelty seems to be proposing pairwise ranking prompting as a way to effectively harness LLMs for ranking tasks. The results using moderate sized LLMs are the first to match larger supervised models and proprietary LLMs on standard benchmarks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) for text ranking through pairwise ranking prompting. Other recent work has also examined leveraging LLMs for text ranking, but has primarily focused on pointwise and listwise ranking approaches. This paper provides a novel pairwise ranking prompting methodology.

- The results show that pairwise ranking prompting with moderate-sized, open-sourced LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard text ranking benchmarks like TREC-DL2019 and TREC-DL2020. Other existing methods rely on larger proprietary LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4. 

- The pairwise approach seems more effective for LLMs compared to pointwise and listwise techniques. The authors argue those methods require calibrated scores or complex listwise ranking, which current LLMs struggle with. The pairwise prompting simplifies the task.

- This paper examines different variants of pairwise prompting for efficiency, like sliding window approaches. Other recent work has not explored efficiency trade-offs in using LLMs for ranking.

- The robustness experiments on input order sensitivity and scoring vs generation APIs also provide useful comparisons to alternative methods.

Overall, this paper advances the use of LLMs for text ranking by proposing a new pairwise ranking prompting methodology and demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing pointwise and listwise approaches. The results are state-of-the-art while using more accessible open-sourced LLMs. The analysis and variants also provide valuable insights into utilizing LLMs for ranking tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring more effective prompts for ranking tasks with LLMs, such as different formulations or adding more task-specific instructions. The authors suggest prompt design is an interesting area for future work.

- Investigating more efficient ranking paradigms with LLMs to further reduce the computational cost. The authors point out reducing the number of calls to LLMs is an important research direction.

- Evaluating the performance of the proposed methods on more LLMs, including GPT models which were not tested in this work. The authors suggest testing other models is meaningful future benchmarking. 

- Studying how to make LLMs more "ranking-aware", potentially through pre-training or fine-tuning procedures, while maintaining their generality. The authors discuss making LLMs ranking-aware as a challenging research direction.

- Adapting the techniques to other specialized ranking datasets beyond the standard relevance ranking tested here. The authors mention domain adaptation as an area needing more investigation.

In summary, the main future directions focus on developing more effective and efficient ranking prompts and techniques tailored for LLMs, evaluating on more models and datasets, and researching methods to make LLMs more aware of and specialized for ranking tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to rank documents for information retrieval tasks. Existing methods use pointwise or listwise prompting formulations which are difficult for LLMs to understand and produce good results with. PRP simplifies the task by only prompting the LLM to make pairwise judgments between documents based on a query. Several variants of PRP are proposed including exhaustive pairwise comparisons, sorting based approaches, and sliding window methods to balance performance and efficiency. Experiments on standard TREC benchmark datasets show that PRP with moderate sized LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods using much larger commercial LLMs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of simplifying the ranking task for LLMs through pairwise prompting. Key benefits of PRP include supporting both scoring and generation APIs, computational efficiency, and insensitivity to document order. Overall, the paper provides a promising new technique to enable performant text ranking with LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) for using Large Language Models (LLMs) to rank documents for search queries. Existing methods that directly prompt LLMs with queries and documents have struggled to match the performance of supervised fine-tuned models. The authors analyze two common prompting approaches: pointwise, which asks the LLM to predict relevance scores for each document independently, and listwise, which provides the full ranked list and asks the LLM to reorder it. They find issues with requiring calibrated scores in the pointwise case and with the complexity of full list ranking for current LLMs. 

Instead, PRP constructs prompts that give the LLM a query and a pair of candidate documents at a time, asking it to determine their relative order. By simplifying to pairwise decisions, PRP reduces the burden on LLMs. The authors propose several variants to aggregate the pairwise judgments, including sorting algorithms and sliding windows. Empirically, PRP with a 20B parameter LLM achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, outperforming prior work using much larger proprietary LLMs. The results demonstrate that pairwise prompting better utilizes the capabilities of existing LLMs for ranking.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new technique called Pairwise Ranking Prompting (PRP) to perform text ranking using Large Language Models (LLMs). PRP is based on providing the LLM with a query and a pair of candidate documents, and asking it to indicate which document is more relevant to the query. This pairwise comparison approach reduces the complexity for the LLM compared to existing pointwise and listwise ranking formulations. The paper introduces several variants of PRP, including exhaustive all-pairs comparisons, sorting based on pairwise preferences, and a sliding window approach. Empirical results on TREC benchmark datasets show that PRP with moderate-sized, open-sourced LLMs can achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods relying on much larger proprietary LLMs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of reducing the ranking task complexity through pairwise prompting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to effectively use large language models (LLMs) for text ranking tasks. 

Specifically, the paper discusses the difficulties previous methods have faced in using LLMs for text ranking, such as pointwise and listwise approaches. The key issues identified are:

- Pointwise methods require calibrated relevance scores from the LLM which is difficult. They also don't work with generation-only LLMs.

- Listwise methods place a heavy burden on the LLM to output a full ranked list, resulting in many useless outputs or failures.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a new method called pairwise ranking prompting (PRP) that simplifies the task for the LLM down to making relative judgments on pairs of documents. 

The key question the paper seems to address is: How can we effectively leverage LLMs for text ranking using simple prompting techniques? The PRP method is proposed as a way to reduce the complexity for LLMs to do text ranking in a zero-shot setting without fine-tuning.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of how to tap into the power of LLMs for text ranking tasks, when existing methods have struggled to show strong performance. The PRP technique is introduced as a promising new approach to enable LLMs to excel at text ranking via pairwise comparisons.
