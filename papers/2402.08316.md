## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Gaze estimation, the task of predicting where a person is looking, is challenging to perform accurately in unconstrained real-world environments. Factors like varying poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions make robust gaze estimation difficult. Prior methods either rely on specialized hardware, are tested mostly in controlled settings, or require custom architectures that are not easily updated. There is a need for accurate appearance-based gaze estimation methods that can work in the wild.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes CrossGaze, a strong baseline CNN architecture for appearance-based 3D gaze estimation. It utilizes an Inception ResNet backbone to extract multi-scale face features focused on the eyes region. A second ResNet encoder extracts local eye features. A cross-attention module combines the global and local features to output an eye-informed gaze vector. The model is pretrained on VGGFace2 and does not require a specialized architecture.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on Gaze360 benchmark with mean angular error of 9.94 degrees, outperforming prior works.
- Provides ablation studies analyzing impact of face encoder backbone, pretraining datasets, and eye feature integration methods. 
- Introduces a conceptually simple gaze estimation pipeline combining recent advancements like attention and transfer learning without specialized architectures.
- Serves as a strong baseline for future gaze estimation research by demonstrating performance improvements from multi-scale processing, face pretraining, and cross-attention for feature fusion.

In summary, the paper proposes CrossGaze, an accurate and conceptually simple CNN model for appearance-based 3D gaze estimation in unconstrained environments, achieving new state-of-the-art results on a challenging benchmark.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using two separate encoders for extracting features from the face image and eye images. What is the motivation behind using two encoders instead of a single encoder? How does this design choice impact model performance?
