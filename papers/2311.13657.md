# [Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13657)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores the intersection of knowledge distillation and efficient attention mechanisms for transformer models to create high-performing yet cost-effective models for long-context natural language tasks. The authors propose a "Convert-Then-Distill" paradigm whereby they first convert a pretrained language model like RoBERTa to use an efficient attention pattern like Longformer, further pretrain the converted model, then distill it into a smaller student model before fine-tuning on downstream tasks. They introduce GONERD, a new long-context named entity recognition dataset consisting of news articles and legal text. Evaluating several state-of-the-art efficient transformer architectures, they find distillation preserves over 90% of performance on most tasks while reducing inference times by up to 57.8%. The distilled Longformer student performs the best overall, retaining 95.9% performance on GONERD while cutting costs by 50.7%. The authors demonstrate distilled efficient attention models achieve strong performance on both short and long-context tasks at greatly reduced computational requirements compared to their teachers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates the performance and cost-efficiency of distilling knowledge from efficient attention transformer models into smaller student models on a variety of NLP tasks, introducing a new long-context NER dataset called GONERD in the process.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The paper lists two main contributions:

1. Performance analysis of popular pretrained efficient transformers and their distilled students in various contexts, including GLUE, SQuAD, HotpotQA, TriviaQA, CoNLL-2003, and a new dataset called GONERD.

2. Introduction of GONERD, a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset consisting of large amounts of hand-labeled web text data.

So in summary, the main contributions are:

(1) Benchmarking efficient transformer models and their distilled versions across various NLP tasks 
(2) Introducing a new long-context NER dataset called GONERD

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "Convert-Then-Distill" paradigm for developing efficient transformer models. What are the key steps in this paradigm and what is the intuition behind converting then distilling versus other alternatives like "Distill-Then-Convert"?

2. The paper introduces a new dataset called GONERD for evaluating long-context NER models. What makes GONERD different from existing NER datasets like CoNLL-2003? What statistics are provided to characterize the key properties of GONERD?

3. The paper evaluates performance after conversion and after distillation separately in Table 5. What are the key trends observed regarding relative improvements in inference time, memory usage, and downstream task performance? How do these results demonstrate the value of both components?

4. For the distillation process, the paper uses a standard approach based on DistilBERT. What are the key components of the distillation loss function used? How could this approach be extended or tailored to further improve performance of efficient attention models? 

5. The paper ablates over different distillation datasets in Table 6. What combinations of datasets seem to work best? Why might a mixture of both long and short context data be beneficial when distilling efficient attention models?

6. In the results on GLUE and SQuAD, the distilled LSG RoBERTa model suffers the largest performance drop compared to other efficient attention models. What factors may explain this discrepancy in impact of distillation on LSG?

7. For the HotpotQA and TriviaQA datasets, distillation appears to have a larger negative impact on performance compared to short-context QA. Why might this be the case? How could the distillation process be adapted to better preserve capabilities on long-context QA?

8. The paper introduces GONERD but does not use it for distillation, only for end task evaluation. Do you think distilling on GONERD could help improve efficiency and performance on long-context NER compared to distilling only on OSCAR? Why or why not?

9. Error analysis reveals LOC and ORG are the most difficult tags for models to learn on GONERD. In contrast, performance on the MISC tag far exceeds expectations. What explanations does the paper give for this? Do you have any other hypotheses?

10. The paper only explores "Convert-Then-Distill" but leaves open the potential of "Distill-Then-Convert". What challenges do you anticipate in attempting to distill first and then convert attention to be more efficient? What benefits might this approach have?
