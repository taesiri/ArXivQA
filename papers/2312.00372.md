# [Event-driven Real-time Retrieval in Web Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00372)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a novel real-time retrieval approach called Event-driven Real-time Retrieval (ERR) for news search scenarios that require retrieving the most timely and relevant breaking news stories. ERR expands user queries with related breaking events to better capture instant search intent and then fuses this event information into the query representation using cross-attention and multi-task learning. To obtain suitable training data for the real-time search task and reduce annotation costs, the authors develop an automated two-stage annotation pipeline consisting of a model-based coarse annotation followed by an instruction-tuned language model fine annotation. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale data demonstrate ERR's superior performance over state-of-the-art baseline methods, with especially pronounced gains on retrieving timely event-related documents. Online A/B testing results further validate ERR's effectiveness, with metrics like CTR and dwell time showing over 4-5% average improvement. The proposed event augmentation strategy and tailored model training and data annotation techniques enable effectively meeting users' real-time search needs in news scenarios.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated regarding key aspects of the methodology:

1. How exactly is the event augment technique used to choose the most relevant expansion event related to a query from various candidate events? What features of events are considered and what algorithms are used for ranking?

2. How is the adaptive cross-attention mechanism able to handle differences in distribution between online session queries and offline data? Does it help to overcome the issue of low event coverage?

3. Why is multi-task learning with a query-centric task and an event-centric task helpful for improving event representation? How are the differences in negative sampling utilized?

4. For coarse annotation using ModelZoo, how is the threshold determined for each model to classify sample pairs as easy or hard? What metrics guide such threshold selection?  

5. What is the motivation behind breaking down the annotation task into multiple steps following the Chain-of-Thought prompting technique? How does it help compared to a single-step instruction?

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Event-driven Real-time Retrieval in Web Search":

Problem: 
- Real-time search presents challenges distinct from classical web search due to the rapid change in user intent influenced by breaking news events. 
- Existing dense retrieval methods using static semantic representations fail to capture immediate search intent, leading to poor performance in retrieving the most recent event-related documents.

Proposed Solution - Event-driven Real-time Retrieval (ERR):
- Expands queries with event information representing real-time search intent, then fuses them via a cross-attention mechanism into a time-context query representation.
- Enhances event representation through multi-task training with a query-centric task and event-centric task. 
- Introduces a two-stage automatic data annotation pipeline with ModelZoo-based Coarse Annotation and LLM-driven Fine Annotation to obtain data for timely retrieval efficiently.
- Employs two-stage training paradigm with large-scale business data and LLM-annotated multi-class data.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes ERR model to improve real-time retrieval by fusing queries and events using cross-attention and multi-task learning.
- Introduces efficient two-stage data annotation approach to acquire timely retrieval data and reduce labeling costs.  
- Conducts extensive offline experiments on million-scale dataset and online A/B testing showing ERR significantly outperforms baseline methods for real-time retrieval.

In summary, the paper tackles challenges in real-time search by expanding queries with events and fusing them to better capture immediate intent. A new data annotation pipeline and training procedure are proposed. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ERR in retrieving timely event-related documents.
