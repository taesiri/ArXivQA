## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

This paper proposes a novel real-time retrieval approach called Event-driven Real-time Retrieval (ERR) for news search scenarios that require retrieving the most timely and relevant breaking news stories. ERR expands user queries with related breaking events to better capture instant search intent and then fuses this event information into the query representation using cross-attention and multi-task learning. To obtain suitable training data for the real-time search task and reduce annotation costs, the authors develop an automated two-stage annotation pipeline consisting of a model-based coarse annotation followed by an instruction-tuned language model fine annotation. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale data demonstrate ERR's superior performance over state-of-the-art baseline methods, with especially pronounced gains on retrieving timely event-related documents. Online A/B testing results further validate ERR's effectiveness, with metrics like CTR and dwell time showing over 4-5% average improvement. The proposed event augmentation strategy and tailored model training and data annotation techniques enable effectively meeting users' real-time search needs in news scenarios.
