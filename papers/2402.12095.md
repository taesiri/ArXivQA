# [Major TOM: Expandable Datasets for Earth Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12095)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Earth observation (EO) models require very large datasets for training, but current EO datasets are fragmented and limited in scale. 
- Existing datasets are created for specific narrow tasks rather than empowering large models. 
- There is duplication of effort in dataset creation, and a lack of interoperability between datasets.

Proposed Solution - Major TOM:
- A standardized framework for building interconnected EO datasets at scale.  
- Uses a global grid system for geographical indexing and metadata structure for interoperability.
- Allows users to easily combine, access and share multiple datasets.

Key Contributions:

1. Specification of Major TOM framework:
   - Grid of equidistant points for geographical indexing. 
   - Flexible metadata structure based on STAC standard.
   - Enables interoperable combination of diverse datasets.

2. MajorTOM-Core dataset:
   - Largest openly available Sentinel-2 dataset created: 2.5 trillion pixels.
   - Near global coverage across land areas captured by Sentinel mission. 
   - Raw top-of-atmosphere reflectance provided.

3. MajorTOM-LUCAS-2018 dataset:
   - 180k+ Sentinel-2 patches paired with ground imagery from LUCAS survey.
   - Demonstrates versatility of Major TOM for heterogeneous data sources.

4. Vision for open, interconnected ecosystem of EO datasets, models and benchmarks enabled by standardized Major TOM framework.

In summary, Major TOM provides a standardized framework to address key limitations around scale and interoperability of EO datasets. The initial datasets released showcase the potential, but the vision is for an extensive open ecosystem of diverse EO data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Major TOM proposes an extensible framework for large-scale Earth observation datasets based on a global grid system and metadata structure to enable combining multiple modalities, with an initial open dataset called MajorTOM-Core providing over 2 trillion Sentinel-2 pixels covering nearly 50% of Earth's land surface.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal and release of Major TOM (Terrestrial Observation Metaset), which is described as:

1) A framework consisting of a geographical indexing grid system and metadata structure to allow multiple Earth observation datasets to be combined and accessed in an interoperable way. The goal of this framework is to aid in the dissemination and utilization of existing and new EO datasets.

2) The release of MajorTOM-Core, which is reported to be the largest openly available Sentinel-2 dataset to date with over 2.5 trillion pixels covering nearly every point on Earth captured by Sentinel-2. This acts as a first contribution following the Major TOM framework and provides an immediately useful resource for the community.

In summary, the paper puts forward Major TOM as a more extensible and future-proof approach for building Earth observation datasets, and MajorTOM-Core as a concrete implementation of this vision as the largest open Sentinel-2 dataset released so far. The combination of the framework and an initial large-scale open dataset is presented as the main contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

- datasets
- open-access 
- deep learning
- data curation
- Earth Observation (EO)
- Sentinel-2
- standardization 
- interoperability
- geospatial data
- metadata
- indexing

Specifically, the paper proposes a framework called "Major TOM (Terrestrial Observation Metaset)" for standardizing and combining Earth observation datasets to improve interoperability and enable larger-scale deep learning. It also releases a large open Sentinel-2 dataset called "MajorTOM-Core" and a Europe-wide ground imagery dataset called "MajorTOM-LUCAS-2018" following this framework. Key aspects include the geographical indexing grid, metadata structure, and flexibility to allow integrating diverse datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the motivation behind proposing the Major TOM framework? Why is there a need for a standardized and extensible framework for Earth observation datasets?

2. How does the Major TOM grid work? Explain in detail the calculations involved in spacing the grid points approximately evenly across latitudes and longitudes. 

3. What are the key benefits of using a STAC-compliant metadata structure? How does this aid in combining and accessing multiple Major TOM datasets?

4. What steps were taken during the curation of the MajorTOM-Core dataset to ensure high quality samples with minimal clouds and gaps? What cloud masking techniques were used?

5. Why was the patch size of 1068x1068 pixels chosen for the Sentinel-2 samples in MajorTOM-Core? How does this accommodate the different native resolutions of the spectral bands?

6. What is the total coverage and volume achieved in the current version of MajorTOM-Core? How does this compare to previous large-scale EO datasets? Where are the remaining gaps?

7. How can the Major TOM framework accommodate heterogeneous geospatial data beyond image rasters, as demonstrated through the MajorTOM-LUCAS dataset? What analysis tasks does this enable?

8. How can Major TOM aid in constructing complex multitask datasets and problems? Give some examples of derived products that could be shared.

9. How might the Major TOM structure help with reproducibility and comparison of machine learning methods applied to EO data?

10. What steps would be involved in adapting a new geospatial dataset to fit into the Major TOM standards? What are some examples of data sources you would like to see integrated in the future?
