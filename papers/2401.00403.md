# [Client-wise Modality Selection for Balanced Multi-modal Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper analyzes traditional client selection methods in multi-modal federated learning (MFL) and reveals that they suffer from a severe modality-level bias due to the inconsistent learning progress (modality imbalance) of different modalities. Specifically, traditional methods tend to select clients that improve the dominant modality's performance while neglecting the weak modalities. This impedes the collaborative exploitation of distributed multi-modal data, leading to insufficient local data exploration and global aggregation.

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Client-wise Modality Selection scheme for MFL (CMSFed). The key idea is to select an appropriate combination of modalities from each client in each round to mitigate the modality imbalance and realize full exploitation of each modality. 

Specifically, CMSFed builds a modality selection objective based on gradient approximation with the fully aggregated model update. To further release the potential of each modality and reduce training costs, a modality-level gradient decoupling method is proposed with two separate submodular functions for modality selection. A modal-balanced local training loss is also introduced to enhance the weak modality and align divergent feature spaces across clients.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals the modality-level selection bias issue in MFL and analyzes the interactions between modalities
- Proposes CMSFed scheme to select modalities from clients in each round to mitigate imbalance and exploit all modalities 
- Introduces modality-level gradient decoupling and modal-balanced local loss to balance MFL
- Achieves significant improvement over baselines on three datasets and shows robustness under different data distributions and modality combinations

In summary, the paper provides important insights into multi-modal federated learning and proposes an effective client-wise modality selection approach to address the modality imbalance issue and realize comprehensive multi-modal data utilization.
