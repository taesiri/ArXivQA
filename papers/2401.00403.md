# [Client-wise Modality Selection for Balanced Multi-modal Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper analyzes traditional client selection methods in multi-modal federated learning (MFL) and reveals that they suffer from a severe modality-level bias due to the inconsistent learning progress (modality imbalance) of different modalities. Specifically, traditional methods tend to select clients that improve the dominant modality's performance while neglecting the weak modalities. This impedes the collaborative exploitation of distributed multi-modal data, leading to insufficient local data exploration and global aggregation.

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Client-wise Modality Selection scheme for MFL (CMSFed). The key idea is to select an appropriate combination of modalities from each client in each round to mitigate the modality imbalance and realize full exploitation of each modality. 

Specifically, CMSFed builds a modality selection objective based on gradient approximation with the fully aggregated model update. To further release the potential of each modality and reduce training costs, a modality-level gradient decoupling method is proposed with two separate submodular functions for modality selection. A modal-balanced local training loss is also introduced to enhance the weak modality and align divergent feature spaces across clients.

Main Contributions:
- Reveals the modality-level selection bias issue in MFL and analyzes the interactions between modalities
- Proposes CMSFed scheme to select modalities from clients in each round to mitigate imbalance and exploit all modalities 
- Introduces modality-level gradient decoupling and modal-balanced local loss to balance MFL
- Achieves significant improvement over baselines on three datasets and shows robustness under different data distributions and modality combinations

In summary, the paper provides important insights into multi-modal federated learning and proposes an effective client-wise modality selection approach to address the modality imbalance issue and realize comprehensive multi-modal data utilization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a client-wise modality selection scheme for multi-modal federated learning to address the issue of modality imbalance by selectively employing different modalities from each client in each round to realize balanced and comprehensive utilization of distributed multi-modal data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It analyzes traditional client selection methods in multi-modal federated learning (MFL) and reveals that there exists a strong modality-level bias due to the modality imbalance during training. 

2. It proposes a client-wise modality selection scheme for MFL (CMSFed) to address the modality imbalance issue. CMSFed selectively employs different modalities from each client in each round to realize balanced and comprehensive exploitation of all modalities.

3. It introduces a modality-level gradient decoupling method along with a modal-balanced local training loss to build two separate submodular functions for unbiased modality selection. This not only reduces algorithm complexity but also saves local training costs.

4. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that CMSFed achieves significant improvements over baselines in terms of performance. The experiments also showcase its superiority in comprehensively exploiting distributed multi-modal data.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing CMSFed to tackle the modality imbalance issue in MFL via a meticulously designed modality selection strategy, which leads to balanced and sufficient utilization of all modalities.

The paper proposes a client-wise modality selection scheme called CMSFed to address the issue of modality imbalance and bias in multi-modal federated learning. Key ideas include selectively choosing modalities for training on each client, using gradient decoupling and submodular maximization for efficient selection, enhancing the weak modality with prototypical loss, and aligning client representations. The goal is to improve utilization of multi-modal data and accuracy of the aggregated global model while maintaining communication efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that traditional client selection methods in multi-modal federated learning (MFL) can suffer from modality imbalance and bias towards dominant modalities. Can you elaborate on why this occurs and how it hinders the learning of weaker modalities?

2. The local prototype-based cross entropy (PCE) loss is used in the balanced local training loss function. What is the intuition behind using a prototype-based loss here compared to a standard cross entropy loss? How does it help enhance the gradients of the weaker modality?

3. The paper proposes a modality-level gradient decoupling strategy. Why is decoupling the gradients beneficial compared to optimizing them jointly? How does it help reduce the training overhead?

4. Explain the two separate submodular functions that are built after gradient decoupling. What role does each play in ensuring diverse and balanced modality selection? 

5. The conflict resolution strategy selects uni-modal or multi-modal data for a client based on the local imbalance ratio. Walk through how this strategy helps balance selection across modalities and mitigate bias.

6. Global prototypes are used to align feature spaces for the weak modality across selected clients. Why is this alignment important when clients have inconsistent modality adoption strategies?

7. Theoretically analyze the communication and computational complexity of CMSFed. How do they compare to traditional client selection methods in MFL?

8. What customizations would be needed to apply CMSFed to tasks beyond classification, such as regression or reinforcement learning?

9. How could the modality selection strategy be extended to settings with more than two modalities per client? What additional considerations would come into play?

10. An alternative approach could jointly optimize client and modality selection in one stage. Compare the pros and cons of the proposed two-stage method versus a potential joint selection method.
