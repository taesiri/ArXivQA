# [Learning Correction Errors via Frequency-Self Attention for Blind Image   Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Previous blind image super-resolution (SR) methods rely on degradation estimation to restore high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) counterparts. However, accurate degradation estimation is very challenging. The incompatibility between the SR model and the degradation estimation method, particularly the Correction Filter, can significantly impair performance due to correction errors. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new blind SR method called Learning Correction Errors (LCE) that focuses on learning the correction errors to avoid the incompatibility issue. The key ideas are:

1) Use a lightweight Corrector to obtain a corrected LR (CLR) image without requiring accurate kernel estimation. 

2) Jointly optimize SR performance in an SR network by utilizing both the original LR image and the frequency learning of the CLR image. This allows learning the correction errors.

3) Propose a Frequency-Self Attention Block (FSAB) that enhances global information utilization by integrating both self-attention and frequency spatial attention.

Main Contributions:

1) A new blind SR architecture called LCE that learns correction errors to address incompatibility issues and improve SR performance.

2) A novel FSAB that combines self-attention and frequency spatial attention to achieve better global representations.

3) Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance of LCE over previous blind SR methods, especially for complicated anisotropic kernels. The method effectively tackles the challenges of degradation estimation and correction errors.

In summary, the paper proposes a new perspective to blind SR by learning correction errors instead of relying on accurate degradation estimation. This is achieved via a jointly optimized network augmented with frequency learning and attention. Extensive results demonstrate the superiority of the approach.
