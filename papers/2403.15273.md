# [Event Temporal Relation Extraction based on Retrieval-Augmented on LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15273)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Event temporal relation (TempRel) extraction is an important but challenging NLP task due to the inherent ambiguity in temporal relations between events. 
- Existing methods based on manual template design often fail to accurately capture precise temporal knowledge needed for good performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented TempRel extraction approach that utilizes knowledge retrieved from large language models (LLMs) to enhance prompt templates and verbalizers. 
- It first manually designs template styles and does an initial evaluation to analyze the impact of different styles and trigger word choices.
- It then leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to query various LLMs and collect modifier words to fill prompt templates as well as map label spaces for verbalizer design. 
- An algorithm is used to find the best performing pattern-verbalizer pair (PVP) on validation sets by combining different modifiers and verbalizers.

Main Contributions:
- First work to integrate RAG with prompt-based learning for TempRel extraction to address the ambiguity challenge.
- Proposes a method to fully exploit knowledge from different LLMs via RAG for better PVP design tailored to TempRel task.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results on 3 widely used TempRel datasets, demonstrating efficacy of using LLMs to inspire and enhance PVPs.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in enhancing prompt-based TempRel extraction by leveraging knowledge retrieved from LLMs via RAG to design better performing PVPs that can accurately capture temporal relations between events.
