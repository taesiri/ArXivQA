## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes research on building safe and reliable AI systems for safety-critical tasks involving vision and language processing. It discusses challenges such as failure detection, overfitting, uncertainty quantification, and robustness that limit deployment of AI in sensitive applications. The main research questions are improving model uncertainty estimation using techniques like generalized label smoothing and more accurate curriculum learning, and applying these to build an end-to-end pipeline for vision-language tasks that is more reliable and robust. Preliminary results show models with higher accuracy do not necessarily have better calibration. The paper aims to improve calibration and develop techniques to detect the model's own mistakes during inference to make vision-language processing safer for real-world deployment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes research towards building safe and reliable AI systems for safety critical tasks involving vision and language processing. The introduction explains that current AI systems lack mechanisms for failure detection, identifying overfitting, quantifying uncertainty, and robustness to data perturbations. This makes them unsafe for deployment in sensitive applications like autonomous vehicles or medical diagnosis. The author argues that improving model uncertainty quantification is key to making AI systems more reliable and trustworthy. Preliminary results demonstrate that common CNN and transformer models on image classification benchmarks do not always have uncertainty estimates matching their accuracy. Additional techniques are needed to improve calibration. The author suggests research questions around developing better techniques for uncertainty quantification, failure detection, ranking sample difficulty, and building robust vision-language pipelines. Through improving uncertainty estimation, the goal is to build systems that can detect their own errors and defer to human experts when unsure, creating a safeguard for sensitive applications.

In summary, this paper motivates research into improving model uncertainty quantification in vision and language tasks to enable safer AI system deployment. Techniques will focus on soft label generalization, automatic failure detection, curriculum learning via confidence scores, and robust vision-language pipelines. By developing AI that better conveys its own uncertainty, the author aims to create safeguards that identify model mistakes and involve human oversight when appropriate. This will facilitate deploying AI systems in sensitive, safety critical domains like healthcare and transportation.
