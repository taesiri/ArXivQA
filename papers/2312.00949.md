# [Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Instruction-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00949)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 on downstream tasks is computationally expensive. 
- Methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tune only a small portion of parameters, but are sensitive to choice of hyperparameters like rank.
- Manually tuning hyperparameters is tedious. This paper investigates using blackbox optimization to automatically find good hyperparameters.

Methods
- Formulate hyperparameter tuning as blackbox optimization problem with validation loss as objective. 
- Compare two methods:
  - NOMAD: Implements mesh adaptive direct search algorithm
  - NNI: Implements Bayesian tree-structured Parzen estimator 
- Fine-tune 7B parameter Llama-2 model with LoRA on instruction-following datasets
- Assess tuned models on downstream tasks using InstructEval library

Results
- Both NOMAD and NNI find models with lower validation loss than default hyperparameters
- NOMAD models get higher scores on downstream tasks 
- NOMAD models also preferred by human evaluators over default hyperparameters

Contributions  
- Show blackbox optimization can automatically find good hyperparameters for instruction tuning
- NOTMAD (direct search) outperforms NNI (Bayesian method) for this problem
- Tuning improves performance on downstream tasks and human preference

Human Takeaway  
This paper demonstrates that blackbox optimization is an effective approach for automatically tuning hyperparameters of large language models to improve performance on instruction-following tasks. The direct search NOMAD algorithm produced better results than the Bayesian NNI method. Tuning boosted downstream task scores and human preference over default hyperparameters.
