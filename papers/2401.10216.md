# [Enabling Efficient Equivariant Operations in the Fourier Basis via Gaunt   Tensor Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10216)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Developing equivariant neural networks for the 3D Euclidean group (E(3)) plays an important role in modeling 3D data across applications like molecular modeling, protein biology, and computer vision. 
- Enforcing E(3) equivariance primarily involves tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly with higher-order tensors, hindering efficiency and limiting irrep degrees in practice.

Proposed Solution:
- The key insight is that Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for tensor products are mathematically equivalent to Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of spherical harmonics (basis functions on the sphere). 
- This perspective allows expressing tensor products as multiplications between spherical functions in the spherical harmonics basis. 
- By changing basis to a 2D Fourier domain, the multiplications become 2D convolutions, which can be computed efficiently via FFTs and convolution theorems.

Main Contributions:
- Establish a connection between Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and Gaunt coefficients to view tensor products as multiplications of spherical functions.
- Propose to change basis to 2D Fourier domain and leverage FFTs to accelerate computation from O(L^6) to O(L^3). 
- Introduce Gaunt Tensor Product as a new technique for efficient equivariant operations in various models. 
- Demonstrate improved efficiency and effectiveness over prior art on tasks like molecular property prediction and 3D vision.

In summary, the paper develops mathematical techniques to substantially improve the efficiency of tensor product operations for equivariant networks on E(3), enabling the use of higher-order representations. This is shown to also improve model accuracy across applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of tensor products of irreducible representations, which are important equivariant operations, by connecting Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to Gaunt coefficients and leveraging convolutions and fast Fourier transforms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). Specifically:

1) The paper connects the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for tensor products to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of spherical harmonics. This perspective allows expressing tensor products as multiplications between spherical functions. 

2) Leveraging this insight, the paper proposes changing the basis from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis to represent the spherical functions. Multiplications between functions in the 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed using the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). 

3) Based on this approach, the paper introduces the Gaunt Tensor Product as a new technique to enable efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Experiments show improved efficiency and effectiveness compared to prior implementations.

In summary, the key innovation is establishing a connection between Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and Gaunt coefficients to accelerate tensor products of irreps via efficient 2D convolutions, which serves as a general approach for designing efficient equivariant neural networks.
