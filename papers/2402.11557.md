# [Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of Low dose CT Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper evaluates the robustness of different classical and deep learning methods for low-dose CT image reconstruction. Low-dose CT acquisition is important to reduce patients' exposure to harmful radiation. However, it leads to noisy measurements with artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. Recent deep learning approaches have shown impressive performance for CT recovery from such low-dose measurements. But their robustness needs analysis before clinical deployment. Specifically, the paper investigates the sensitivity of CT recovery methods to adversarial perturbations - minor input changes designed to alter the reconstruction significantly.

Methods Analyzed:
The paper analyzes the robustness of the following methods:
(i) Classical methods: Filtered back projection (FBP), Total variation (TV) regularization 
(ii) Deep learning approaches: 
- Learned network directly inverting the imaging model (iRadonMap)  
- Network post-processing FBP reconstruction (FBP-Unet)
- Model-based learned iterative algorithms with fixed number of steps (Learned primal dual and Learned gradient descent)

Attacks Considered:
1. Untargeted attacks: Finding worst-case perturbations to maximize reconstruction error 
2. Universal attacks: Input-agnostic perturbations affecting reconstruction for any input
3. Localized attacks: Perturbations altering small diagnostically relevant regions  

Main Results:
1. Deep networks are more sensitive to untargeted attacks than classical methods, despite encouraging data consistency
2. Universal and transferable attacks are also feasible
3. Localized attacks successfully cause perceptual changes in small regions, using tiny perturbations and with high data consistency  

Implications:
- Deep networks for CT need better regularization for robustness
- Localized attacks show multiple solutions exist for CT recovery problem with similar data consistency  
- Such attacks can help explore solution space and identify most diagnostically plausible result
