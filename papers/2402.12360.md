# [Nonlinear Discrete-Time Observers with Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of nonlinear state estimation (observation) for nonlinear discrete-time dynamic systems. Obtaining reliable estimates of system states is critical for advanced control algorithms and system monitoring. However, key state variables are often not directly measurable. Conventional observer design methods like Extended Kalman Filters have limitations in handling nonlinearities. Prior work on nonlinear discrete-time observer design also has restrictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) based approach to learn the nonlinear coordinate transformation that can linearize the observer error dynamics. This approach is integrated within the single-step exact observer linearization framework requiring the transformation to satisfy a system of inhomogeneous functional equations. 

A greedy continuation strategy is used to train the PINN to accurately approximate the transformation near singularities. The resulting observer has linear error dynamics with assignable convergence rates. Newton's method is used to compute the inverse transformation and reconstruct original system states from the observer's estimates.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of PINN machine learning models to learn coordinarte transformations for nonlinear discrete-time observer design. Enables accurate approximation near singularities.

- Employing continuation methods to refine PINN training and achieve robust convergence.

- Demonstrated improved approximation accuracy compared to conventional power series expansion methods.

- Detailed numerical studies on two benchmark problems confirming PINN observer quality and analyzing uncertainty quantification.

- Established a framework for data-driven nonlinear observer design that can effectively handle model complexities and singularities.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing nonlinear state observation for discrete-time systems by integrating machine learning based function approximation into an exact observer linearization approach.
