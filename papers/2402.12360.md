# [Nonlinear Discrete-Time Observers with Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12360)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of nonlinear state estimation (observation) for nonlinear discrete-time dynamic systems. Obtaining reliable estimates of system states is critical for advanced control algorithms and system monitoring. However, key state variables are often not directly measurable. Conventional observer design methods like Extended Kalman Filters have limitations in handling nonlinearities. Prior work on nonlinear discrete-time observer design also has restrictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) based approach to learn the nonlinear coordinate transformation that can linearize the observer error dynamics. This approach is integrated within the single-step exact observer linearization framework requiring the transformation to satisfy a system of inhomogeneous functional equations. 

A greedy continuation strategy is used to train the PINN to accurately approximate the transformation near singularities. The resulting observer has linear error dynamics with assignable convergence rates. Newton's method is used to compute the inverse transformation and reconstruct original system states from the observer's estimates.

Main Contributions:
- Novel use of PINN machine learning models to learn coordinarte transformations for nonlinear discrete-time observer design. Enables accurate approximation near singularities.

- Employing continuation methods to refine PINN training and achieve robust convergence.

- Demonstrated improved approximation accuracy compared to conventional power series expansion methods.

- Detailed numerical studies on two benchmark problems confirming PINN observer quality and analyzing uncertainty quantification.

- Established a framework for data-driven nonlinear observer design that can effectively handle model complexities and singularities.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing nonlinear state observation for discrete-time systems by integrating machine learning based function approximation into an exact observer linearization approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes using physics-informed neural networks to learn the nonlinear state transformation map within a single-step exact observer framework for nonlinear discrete-time systems, enabling observer design with linearized error dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the development of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to solve the nonlinear observer state estimation problem in discrete-time systems. Specifically, the paper proposes using PINNs to learn the nonlinear state transformation map that can linearize the observer dynamics up to an output injection term. This enables designing a discrete-time nonlinear observer with linearizable error dynamics and assignable convergence rates under mild assumptions. The key advantages highlighted in the paper are:

1) The proposed PINN scheme outperforms conventional numerical methods like power series expansions in approximating complex nonlinear maps with singularities. This is demonstrated through comparative assessments on two benchmark problems. 

2) A greedy training strategy is introduced to enhance the PINN's ability to handle steep gradients in the transformation map. This significantly improves approximation accuracy compared to standard PINN training.

3) The PINN-based observer design approach requires less restrictive assumptions than other nonlinear observer techniques while ensuring robust state reconstruction and linear error dynamics.

4) Uncertainty quantification analysis demonstrates consistent performance of the PINN scheme across multiple runs.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel machine learning framework for designing nonlinear state observers that exploits the function approximation capabilities of physics-informed neural networks. The proposed methodology advances the state-of-the-art in nonlinear discrete-time observation methods.
