# [3D Reconstruction of Interacting Multi-Person in Clothing from a Single   Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenging problem of reconstructing the complete 3D geometry of multiple interacting people wearing clothing from a single RGB image. A key difficulty is handling occlusion, where parts of a person's body are occluded from view by other people or self-occlusion. This leads to missing geometry and physically implausible reconstructions with interpenetration between people.

Method: 
The paper proposes using two human priors to address the problem - a prior for generating complete human geometry and a prior for modeling likely physical contacts between people. 

For complete geometry, they build on top of an existing 3D generative model (gDNA) that produces a coarse 3D human from a latent code. They enhance it by: (1) Inferring the latent code from the partial RGB image (2) Incorporating image details from surface normal map (3) Using an implicit function to combine the generative 3D features and normal map to output detailed occupancy.

For contacts, they train a network to predict probability maps of contacts between different body parts directly from RGB images.

These priors are then utilized to refine the body poses of each person to prevent interpenetration and align positions, while reconstructing detailed geometry from canonical space to scene space.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel end-to-end pipeline to reconstruct complete and detailed 3D geometry of interacting clothed people from a single image

2) Technique to infer latent code for generative 3D human model from partial RGB input 

3) Surface contact predictor network to estimate interaction and refine body pose

4) Demonstrates high quality results free of artifacts compared to state-of-the-art methods on challenging real datasets with occlusion and clothing


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel pipeline to reconstruct complete and detailed scene-space geometry of interacting multi-person in clothing from a single image by utilizing human priors for 3D geometry and surface contacts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions include:

(1) A novel pipeline that realizes 3D reconstruction of interacting multi-person using only a single image with an effective global pose refinement. 

(2) The innovation to upgrade existing geometric priors that enable a complete and detailed 3D human reconstruction from the image of a partial body. 

(3) An effective scene-space pose refinement framework guided by surface contact priors, which enforces the physical plausibility.

In summary, the key contribution is a new method for reconstructing complete, detailed, and physically plausible 3D geometry of multiple interacting people from a single image, which overcomes challenges like occlusion and penetration artifacts. The method utilizes upgraded geometric priors and contact priors to enable the reconstruction and refinement.
