# [Using Stratified Sampling to Improve LIME Image Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- LIME Image is a popular model-agnostic explainable AI method that generates explanations for image classifiers by fitting a linear model on perturbed versions of the input image. 
- It uses Monte Carlo sampling to randomly mask out superpixels in the image. 
- This can result in inadequate synthetic neighborhoods and poor explanations when the number of superpixels is large, due to undersampling of rare masks that are important to capture local behavior.

Proposed Solution:  
- Use stratified sampling instead of Monte Carlo to ensure balanced sampling across all strata (number of preserved superpixels). This oversamples rare masks.
- Derive an adjustment factor to correct for bias due to oversampling certain strata. 
- Weight the linear regression using this adjustment factor to get unbiased estimates.
- Show connection to concepts from Shapley value theory.

Contributions:
- Identify the problem of dependent variable undersampling in LIME Image with increasing superpixels
- Propose stratified sampling to ensure coverage across all strata  
- Introduce adjustment factors for unbiased weighted linear regression
- Empirically demonstrate improved variation and coverage metrics with stratified sampling
- Highlight similarities with sample relevance concepts from Shapley theory

Overall, the paper does an excellent job clearly explaining the limitations of LIME Image sampling, proposes a method to improve it using stratified sampling strategies, provides theoretical justifications and empirically demonstrates the benefits on imagery datasets.
