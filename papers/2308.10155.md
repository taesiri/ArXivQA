# [Unilaterally Aggregated Contrastive Learning with Hierarchical   Augmentation for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10155)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes a new method for anomaly detection called UniCon-HA (Unilaterally Aggregated Contrastive Learning with Hierarchical Augmentation). The key hypothesis is that a good representation for anomaly detection requires:1) A compact distribution for inliers. 2) A dispersive distribution for outliers (including virtual/simulated outliers).The paper argues that existing self-supervised learning methods for anomaly detection using contrastive learning do not fully address these two requirements. The proposed UniCon-HA method aims to explicitly optimize for both inlier concentration and outlier dispersion through a combination of supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses.In summary, the central hypothesis is that explicitly encouraging inlier concentration and outlier dispersion, along with additional techniques like soft aggregation and hierarchical augmentation, will lead to improved anomaly detection performance compared to prior self-supervised methods. The experiments aim to validate whether UniCon-HA better optimizes these desired properties and achieves state-of-the-art results across different anomaly detection settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new contrastive learning method called UniCon-HA for anomaly detection. The key ideas are:- Explicitly encouraging the concentration of inlier features and the dispersion of outlier features via supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses. This better aligns with the goal of anomaly detection compared to prior contrastive learning methods.- Using soft aggregation to re-weight augmented views of inliers based on their deviation from the inlier distribution. This helps ensure a purified concentration of inliers. - Adopting an easy-to-hard hierarchical augmentation strategy and performing contrastive aggregation at different network depths based on augmentation strength. This further improves inlier concentration.The proposed UniCon-HA method is evaluated on various anomaly detection benchmarks across different settings - unlabeled one-class, unlabeled multi-class, and labeled multi-class. It demonstrates consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods. The ability to incorporate outlier exposure is also shown to boost performance further.In summary, the main contribution is a novel contrastive learning approach specially designed for anomaly detection, which focuses on optimizing inlier concentration and outlier dispersion. This is shown through experiments to outperform previous contrastive learning methods for this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel anomaly detection method based on contrastive learning, called UniCon-HA, that explicitly encourages the concentration of inliers and the dispersion of virtual outliers generated by distributional shifts like rotation, using a combination of supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses, soft aggregation to suppress outlier views from data augmentation, and hierarchical augmentation for higher inlier concentration.
