# [Efficient Multi-Object Pose Estimation using Multi-Resolution Deformable   Attention and Query Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08268)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new vision transformer model for multi-object 6D pose estimation from RGB images. The authors formulate pose estimation as a set prediction problem, where the model predicts a set of object poses in one forward pass. They investigate incorporating inductive biases from convolutional neural networks into the architecture to improve efficiency while retaining the benefits of attention for modeling long-range dependencies. Specifically, they utilize multi-resolution deformable attention, where attention is performed between only a small set of deformed reference points rather than all features. They also propose a query aggregation mechanism to increase the number of object queries without increasing computational complexity. The model extracts multi-resolution image features using a CNN backbone, then applies the proposed deformable attention encoder-decoder architecture and finally predicts object poses in parallel using feedforward layers. Their best model with 16 deformable attention points achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging YCB-Video dataset for 6D pose estimation. Ablation studies demonstrate the impact of various architectural choices. They also analyze failure cases, with occlusion remaining a significant challenge. The work provides valuable insights into inductive bias design for vision transformers and demonstrates their applicability for joint object detection and pose estimation.
