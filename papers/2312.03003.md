# [Explore, Select, Derive, and Recall: Augmenting LLM with Human-like   Memory for Mobile Task Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for mobile task automation due to their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, LLMs suffer from inherent unreliability and high operational costs, limiting their practical applicability. 

Solution:
The paper introduces MemoDroid, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator enhanced with a unique app memory. MemoDroid aims to emulate the cognitive process humans use when interacting with mobile apps:

1. Explore: Analyze app screens to identify available sub-tasks
2. Select: Choose the most relevant sub-task to reach the end goal 
3. Derive: Incrementally perform primitive actions to complete the sub-task
4. Recall: Store executed sub-tasks in memory for easy reuse and adaptation  

By decomposing tasks into reusable sub-tasks, MemoDroid can efficiently learn and adapt tasks to varying contexts.

Contributions:
- Hierarchical app memory that stores tasks as sequences of sub-tasks and actions for modular reuse
- Flexible adaptation of learned tasks/sub-tasks to new parameters and interface changes  
- Dual-strategy failure handling through LLM self-correction and human-in-the-loop repair
- Reduces task latency by 69.22% and cost by 77.36% compared to baseline
- Achieves 100% task accuracy in warm-starts by reusing and adapting prior executions
- Enables intuitive human-LLM collaboration to incrementally improve automation

In summary, by augmenting LLMs with an app memory inspired by human cognition, MemoDroid enables reliable, efficient and adaptable mobile task automation.
