## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Trajectory tracking for autonomous navigation often relies on visual SLAM systems for pose estimation feedback. However, SLAM systems accumulate drift over time which degrades trajectory tracking performance. 
- Direct image-based methods like visual teach and repeat (VTR) require an explicit prior map and cannot adapt to dynamic environments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach called "trajectory servoing" that performs image-based trajectory tracking using visual servoing without relying on explicit pose estimation from SLAM.

- It uses the features and depth estimates from a SLAM system to synthesize desired feature trajectories corresponding to short path segments. 

- These feature trajectories are used as dynamic goals for visual servoing to enable trajectory tracking without explicit pose feedback.

- As features leave the field of view, the system replenishes features using the SLAM map and synthesizes new feature trajectories, essentially breaking a long trajectory into short visually servoed segments.

Main Contributions:

- Derives image-based trajectory tracking control laws for non-holonomic robots that integrate feedforward trajectory terms and feedback regulation terms.

- Demonstrates short-term trajectory tracking accuracy comparable to perfect odometry without reliance on pose estimation.

- Integrates trajectory servoing with SLAM to enable online feature replenishment and long term navigation over tens of meters.

- Shows 39% and 21% improvement in trajectory tracking error over pose-based SLAM feedback for long trajectories (20m+).

- Reduces control effort by 10-19% compared to SLAM and perfect odometry baselines.

In summary, the key novelty is performing trajectory tracking completely in image space by synthesizing dynamic feature trajectories from SLAM, avoiding explicit pose feedback and its associated accumulation of errors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a vision-based robot navigation approach called trajectory servoing that combines image-based visual servoing and visual SLAM to achieve accurate trajectory tracking without reliance on global positioning or highly accurate pose estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a vision-based navigation approach called "trajectory servoing" that combines image-based visual servoing (IBVS) and visual SLAM (V-SLAM). Specifically:

- It presents a trajectory servoing system that enables a mobile robot to track short-term trajectories accurately without relying on external pose information. This is done by using V-SLAM to provide a pool of features with estimated depth for propagating forward in time to generate image feature trajectories for IBVS control.

- It integrates this short-term trajectory servoing system with V-SLAM in a multi-loop scheme to achieve long-term navigation. The inner loop performs trajectory servoing using V-SLAM tracked features, while the outer loop uses V-SLAM pose estimates only for feature replenishment when needed.

- It shows through experiments that this trajectory servoing approach can achieve better tracking accuracy compared to conventional pose-based control relying on V-SLAM estimated poses. This indicates trajectory servoing has better closed-loop noise rejection by operating directly in image space.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating a vision-based trajectory tracking method called trajectory servoing that integrates IBVS and V-SLAM to achieve improved accuracy and robustness compared to pose-based methods. The key insight is to use image-space control to reduce sensitivity to SLAM drift.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords associated with it:

- Trajectory servoing - The main concept proposed, which combines image-based visual servoing (IBVS) and SLAM for improved trajectory tracking without absolute positioning.

- Visual servoing (VS) - Using visual feedback for controlling robot motion and stabilizing to a target pose. Relevant techniques include image-based VS (IBVS) and position-based VS (PBVS).

- Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) - Estimating the robot's pose and map of the environment simultaneously as the robot navigates. Used here to provide features and depth estimates.  

- Feature tracking - Tracking visual features frame-by-frame for visual servo control. Reliable tracking is critical and enabled here through SLAM's feature mapping.

- Trajectory tracking - Following a specified trajectory using feedback control. Two main approaches compared are pose-based and the proposed image-based through trajectory servoing.

- Feature replenishment - Augmenting the feature set with new features when they drop too low, enabling longer term operation.

- Non-holonomic robot - Robot with motion constraints, often unable to move sideways. Modelled here with Hilare kinematics.

- Image Jacobian - Relates feature motion in the image to robot motion. Key component of the IBVS feedback control approach.

So in summary - trajectory servoing, IBVS, SLAM, feature tracking and replenishment, trajectory tracking, non-holonomic robots, and Image Jacobian.
