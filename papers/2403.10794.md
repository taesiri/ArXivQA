## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Trajectory tracking for autonomous navigation often relies on visual SLAM systems for pose estimation feedback. However, SLAM systems accumulate drift over time which degrades trajectory tracking performance. 
- Direct image-based methods like visual teach and repeat (VTR) require an explicit prior map and cannot adapt to dynamic environments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new approach called "trajectory servoing" that performs image-based trajectory tracking using visual servoing without relying on explicit pose estimation from SLAM.

- It uses the features and depth estimates from a SLAM system to synthesize desired feature trajectories corresponding to short path segments. 

- These feature trajectories are used as dynamic goals for visual servoing to enable trajectory tracking without explicit pose feedback.

- As features leave the field of view, the system replenishes features using the SLAM map and synthesizes new feature trajectories, essentially breaking a long trajectory into short visually servoed segments.

Main Contributions:

- Derives image-based trajectory tracking control laws for non-holonomic robots that integrate feedforward trajectory terms and feedback regulation terms.

- Demonstrates short-term trajectory tracking accuracy comparable to perfect odometry without reliance on pose estimation.

- Integrates trajectory servoing with SLAM to enable online feature replenishment and long term navigation over tens of meters.

- Shows 39% and 21% improvement in trajectory tracking error over pose-based SLAM feedback for long trajectories (20m+).

- Reduces control effort by 10-19% compared to SLAM and perfect odometry baselines.

In summary, the key novelty is performing trajectory tracking completely in image space by synthesizing dynamic feature trajectories from SLAM, avoiding explicit pose feedback and its associated accumulation of errors.
