# [A Survey on Efficient Federated Learning Methods for Foundation Model   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Foundation models (FMs) like GPT have shown tremendous success recently, but require massive datasets for pre-training which limits their access. Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data but comes with challenges like non-IID data and unstable communication.

- As FMs grow to billions of parameters, computational and communication efficiency becomes critical for adopting them to FL. However, existing FL efficiency methods focus on small models and treat computation and communication separately.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper provides the first survey studying advances in computational and communication efficiency for FL with FMs. 

- They introduce a novel taxonomy categorized into computational efficiency methods like full model training, parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), prompt tuning, instruction tuning and communication efficiency methods like model pruning and full model compression techniques.

- The paper discusses the working of these methods, their benefits and limitations, especially w.r.t. non-IID data and large model sizes. It also analyzes current FL frameworks for FM readiness.

Key Contributions:
- A taxonomy focused on efficiency methods for FL and FMs based on key challenges in computation and communication.

- In-depth analysis of state-of-the-art techniques for efficient on-device FM training/fine-tuning and model compression for communication. 

- Identification of open research questions around evaluation strategies for generative tasks, hyperparameter optimization with PEFT, and impact of PEFT on privacy.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of efficiency techniques to facilitate adoption of large foundation models with federated learning, while highlighting promising future research directions in this domain.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel taxonomy focused on computational and communication efficiency methods for federated learning (FL) systems intended for training and fine-tuning large language models. Can you elaborate on why improving efficiency is critical when working with massive foundation models in FL? What are the key challenges?

2. The paper discusses several computational efficiency techniques like full model training, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), prompt tuning, and instruction tuning. Can you compare and contrast these techniques in terms of their suitability for foundation models, sensitivity to non-IID data, and efficiency? 

3. For PEFT methods like BitFit and adapter-based tuning, how much do they reduce communication compared to full model fine-tuning? What are the tradeoffs in terms of model performance?

4. The paper argues that techniques like LoRA optimization in SLoRA require long warmup times which may not be feasible for some FL systems. Can you suggest ways to mitigate this issue? Are there other PEFT methods more suitable for non-IID FL systems?

5. How exactly does prompt tuning work? Why does the paper state it becomes more effective for larger foundation models? Does prompt tuning completely alleviate the need to fine-tune model parameters?

6. Instruction tuning requires high-quality datasets with precise instructions. Why is this and do you foresee issues in employing this method for real-world decentralized datasets at the edge?

7. For communication-efficiency, how exactly does model pruning work? Why can't we employ it naively by just pruning client models independently without coordination?

8. The paper discusses quantization, sparsification and low-rank compression for full model compression. Can you theoretically compare their effects on model performance, along with their suitability for handling non-IID data?

9. Fine-tuning only updates a small fraction of foundation model parameters. So how relevant are techniques like model pruning and full model compression that were studied on small models earlier?

10. The paper identifies the evaluation of generative tasks, hyperparameter optimization, and effects on privacy as open challenges when employing efficient FL for foundation models. Can you suggest good starting points to tackle these issues?
