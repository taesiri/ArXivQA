# [Doubly Calibrated Estimator for Recommendation on Data Missing Not At   Random](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recommender systems suffer from selection bias as users tend to rate their preferred items, resulting in data missing not at random (MNAR). 
- Existing doubly robust (DR) estimators rely on inaccurate imputed errors and propensity scores from basic models, limiting their effectiveness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides theoretical analysis showing the performance of DR estimators correlates with the calibration of the imputation and propensity models.
- A Doubly Calibrated Estimator (DCE) is proposed involving calibrating both models using calibration experts. 
- Calibration experts are assigned to groups of users via an assignment network, learning specialized knowledge to calibrate the models.
- A tri-level joint learning framework is devised for simultaneously optimizing the calibration experts alongside the prediction and imputation models.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis on how miscalibrated imputation and propensity models increase bias and variance of DR estimators.
- Proposal of Doubly Calibrated Estimator with calibration experts specialized for groups of users to enhance calibration.
- Joint learning framework for simultaneous optimization of calibration experts with prediction and imputation models.
- Extensive experiments validating improved performance over state-of-the-art debiasing methods on real-world datasets.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the importance of model calibration for debiasing and proposes a novel Doubly Calibrated Estimator involving joint optimization of calibration experts to effectively reduce bias and variance of DR estimators for superior recommendation performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Doubly Calibrated Estimator that calibrates both the imputation and propensity models in doubly robust estimators to reduce bias and variance for unbiased recommendation.

2. It proposes a Doubly Calibrated Estimator that involves calibrating both the imputation and propensity models using calibration experts assigned to groups of users via an assignment network. This allows the experts to learn specialized knowledge about user groups to improve calibration.

3. It introduces a tri-level joint learning framework to simultaneously optimize the calibration experts alongside the prediction and imputation models. 

4. It validates the superiority of the proposed doubly calibrated estimator through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The method effectively reduces bias and variance compared to prior DR estimators.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of a Doubly Calibrated Estimator that leverages calibration experts and joint optimization to enhance the debiasing performance of DR estimators for recommendation.
