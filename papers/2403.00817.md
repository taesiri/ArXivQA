# [Doubly Calibrated Estimator for Recommendation on Data Missing Not At   Random](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recommender systems suffer from selection bias as users tend to rate their preferred items, resulting in data missing not at random (MNAR). 
- Existing doubly robust (DR) estimators rely on inaccurate imputed errors and propensity scores from basic models, limiting their effectiveness.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides theoretical analysis showing the performance of DR estimators correlates with the calibration of the imputation and propensity models.
- A Doubly Calibrated Estimator (DCE) is proposed involving calibrating both models using calibration experts. 
- Calibration experts are assigned to groups of users via an assignment network, learning specialized knowledge to calibrate the models.
- A tri-level joint learning framework is devised for simultaneously optimizing the calibration experts alongside the prediction and imputation models.

Main Contributions:
- Theoretical analysis on how miscalibrated imputation and propensity models increase bias and variance of DR estimators.
- Proposal of Doubly Calibrated Estimator with calibration experts specialized for groups of users to enhance calibration.
- Joint learning framework for simultaneous optimization of calibration experts with prediction and imputation models.
- Extensive experiments validating improved performance over state-of-the-art debiasing methods on real-world datasets.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the importance of model calibration for debiasing and proposes a novel Doubly Calibrated Estimator involving joint optimization of calibration experts to effectively reduce bias and variance of DR estimators for superior recommendation performance.
