## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Dolphins, a novel vision-language model designed as a conversational driving assistant to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs). Built upon OpenFlamingo, Dolphins employs an innovative Grounded Chain of Thought (GCoT) process and instruction tuning on a tailored AV dataset to develop comprehensive reasoning abilities. Through qualitative demonstrations, Dolphins exhibits a holistic understanding of complex driving scenarios, interpreting static and dynamic elements effectively for downstream prediction and planning tasks. Additionally, Dolphins demonstrates advanced human-like capabilities including rapid adaptation via in-context learning with only a few examples, error recovery through reflective mechanisms, and natural language conversations covering hazards, planning details, and reasoning. While computational overhead poses deployment challenges, Dolphins marks a major advancement by bridging the gap between state-of-the-art AV systems and human drivers, showcasing scene comprehension, contingency planning, trust building, and transparent operability. The model provides a strong foundation for designing AV assistants with heightened intelligence and responsiveness.
