# [Learned 3D volumetric recovery of clouds and its uncertainty for climate   analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05932)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Significant uncertainty in climate prediction and cloud physics is tied to observational gaps relating to shallow scattered clouds. These clouds are heterogeneous in 3D and sensitive to mixing with the surrounding dry air. Addressing the challenges of observing these clouds requires remote sensing of their three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous volumetric scattering content from multiple views. However, this is a very difficult inverse problem computationally, especially for global scale analysis. Existing physics-based methods using iterative optimization with differential rendering are too slow.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a deep learning system called ProbCT to achieve fast computed tomography (CT) of such clouds at scale. ProbCT takes as input multi-view noisy images of a cloud scene captured by a formation of satellites. It then outputs for each 3D location in the cloud the posterior probability distribution over possible extinction coefficient values at that location. This allows estimating statistics like the most probable extinction value and its uncertainty.

The system uses an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel encoders for images, camera poses and voxel coordinates. It is trained on a large multi-class labeled database of simulated cloud scenes and their corresponding rendered multi-view images. To improve out-of-distribution inference, self-supervised training refines the system using only images of real cloud scenes.

Main Contributions:

1) ProbCT model to estimate posterior probability distributions of the extinction coefficient per voxel from multi-view images, enabling inference of optimal values and uncertainties.

2) Large multi-class labeled database of physics-based simulated cloud scenes for supervised training.

3) Self-supervised training technique using only images for domain adaptation to real clouds.

4) Demonstrates the approach on simulations and real data, and shows relevance of recovered 3D structure and uncertainty to applications like precipitation forecasting and solar power prediction.

5) Inference is orders of magnitude faster compared to physics-based methods and can scale to global analysis.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces ProbCT, a deep learning model that infers the 3D extinction coefficient field and its uncertainty distribution inside clouds from multi-view satellite images, enabling real-time volumetric recovery and downstream analysis relevant to climate science and renewable energy applications.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces ProbCT, a deep learning model for 3D volumetric recovery and uncertainty quantification of clouds from multi-view images. The main contributions are:

1. ProbCT is the first system designed to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the extinction coefficient at each voxel in a 3D volume, enabling extraction of statistics like the most probable value, expected value, and uncertainty measures. This allows quantification of uncertainty, which is important for scientific analysis.

2. An expansive multi-class labeled database of physics-based volumetric cloud fields and corresponding images for supervised training and testing on in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenes.

3. A self-supervised training technique to improve inference on out-of-distribution clouds by incorporating only imagery, without needing additional volumetric data. 

4. Demonstrations of how the recovered 3D structure and uncertainty propagate to downstream tasks like precipitation forecasting and prediction of renewable solar energy potential and its variability.

5. Results on simulated and real-world data showing ProbCT can perform volumetric recovery in close to real-time compared to downlink rates from orbit, while outperforming prior physics-based methods in accuracy and speed.

In summary, ProbCT introduces a new deep learning approach for fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware 3D recovery of cloud morphology from multi-view images, enabled by an expansive database, with applications in climate analysis, weather forecasting, and renewable energy potential assessment.
