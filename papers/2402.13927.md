# [The Delusional Hedge Algorithm as a Model of Human Learning from Diverse   Opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13927)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In real-world learning, people often have to learn from the diverse and contradictory opinions of others rather than through direct experience and exposure to ground truth. 
- Existing machine learning models like the hedge algorithm are limited because they assume full supervision with ground truth labels.
- There is a need for models that can capture how people learn which opinions to trust in semi-supervised or unsupervised settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a "delusional hedge" algorithm that extends the standard hedge algorithm to accommodate unlabeled data. 
- On unlabeled trials, the delusional hedge computes a "delusional loss" for each source based on the predictions of opposing sources weighted by their trustedness. This allows it to exploit both consensus and trustedness on unlabeled data.

Contributions:
- Introduces a semi-supervised variant of the hedge algorithm ("delusional hedge") that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data.
- Conducts two behavioral experiments evaluating human learning against the predictions of the standard hedge, delusional hedge, and a heuristic baseline.
- Finds that the delusional hedge better captures human ability to integrate trust cues from both labeled and unlabeled data, outperforming the standard hedge.
- Advances understanding of how people learn from diverse, conflicting opinions in more naturalistic semi-supervised settings. 
- Provides a bridge between computational learning theory and cognitive models of human social learning.

In summary, the key idea is that by introducing a delusional loss for unlabeled data, the hedge algorithm can be extended to better model human social learning in semi-supervised real-world settings involving diverse opinions. The two experiments provide evidence that people effectively incorporate both labeled and unlabeled experiences when deciding which information sources to trust.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a semi-supervised variant of the hedge algorithm called the "delusional hedge" to model how people learn to trust different information sources when exposed to both labeled and unlabeled data, and shows through experiments that human judgments align well with the predictions of the delusional hedge algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing and evaluating a semi-supervised variant of the hedge algorithm, called the "delusional hedge", as a model of how people learn to trust different information sources when exposed to both labeled and unlabeled data. Specifically:

- The paper introduces the delusional hedge algorithm, which is an extension of the standard supervised hedge algorithm to allow for learning on both labeled and unlabeled trials. On unlabeled trials, the delusional hedge uses the current trust in sources to generate a "delusional loss" that is then used to update the trusts.

- Through two behavioral experiments, the paper shows that human judgments align more closely with the delusional hedge algorithm compared to the standard hedge algorithm or a heuristic baseline, especially when some trials are unlabeled. This suggests humans effectively incorporate both labeled and unlabeled data when deciding which information sources to trust.

- The work provides a computational framework based on learning theory to model an important real-world phenomenon of how people learn from diverse, contradictory opinions. By bridging machine learning and cognitive science, it aims to advance our understanding of human social learning.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and providing experimental evidence for the delusional hedge algorithm as a model of human learning of trust in information sources in semi-supervised settings.

The paper proposes a semi-supervised variant of the hedge algorithm called the "delusional hedge" that is able to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. It conducts experiments comparing human learning behavior to the predictions of the standard hedge, delusional hedge, and a heuristic baseline model. The key findings are that humans effectively incorporate both supervised and unsupervised information in a way that aligns with the delusional hedge algorithm, suggesting they gauge not only the accuracy of information sources but also their consistency with other reliable sources. This has implications for modeling how people learn to weigh conflicting opinions. So the core focus is on semi-supervised learning, the hedge algorithm, online learning concepts, notions of accuracy and trust, and the new delusional hedge algorithm proposed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The delusional hedge algorithm is proposed as a semi-supervised variant of the standard hedge algorithm. How exactly does it differ from the standard hedge algorithm in its update rules, specifically in terms of how it handles unlabeled data?

2. The delusional loss used by the delusional hedge algorithm on unlabeled trials is defined in a particular way, as the sum of trust across sources with opposing predictions. What is the rationale behind this specific definition of delusional loss? How does it allow the algorithm to exploit consensus among sources?

3. The delusional loss is weighted by a hyperparameter α. What is the effect of α on the behavior of the delusional hedge algorithm? In particular, what does the algorithm reduce to when α=0 or α=1?

4. Experiment 1 compares predictions of the delusional hedge not only to the standard hedge but also to a heuristic baseline model. What is this baseline model and what are its key properties? How do its predictions qualitatively differ from the hedge algorithms?

5. In Experiment 1, what were the key results that favored the delusional hedge algorithm over the alternatives in explaining human data? What evidence suggests it better captures learning in fully unsupervised settings in particular?  

6. Experiment 2 is designed to create a scenario where standard and delusional hedge algorithms make qualitatively distinct predictions. What are these predictions and how do they differ? What results from the experiment support the delusional hedge as better matching human behavior?

7. The delusional hedge algorithm assumes that the learner generates a predicted label on unlabeled trials by sampling from a Bernoulli distribution parameterized by the aggregated source trusts. What impact would changing this distributional assumption have on the behavior of the algorithm?

8. What mechanisms might underlie people's ability to effectively integrate labeled and unlabeled data in the manner exhibited by the delusional hedge algorithm? What cognitive capacities might this rely on? 

9. The authors note that the delusional hedge provides a starting point for bridging machine learning and cognitive science approaches to human social learning. What other machine learning algorithms seem worth exploring in future work along these lines? What modifications might be entailed?

10. The paper focuses on a binary classification scenario. How might the approach extend to settings with more than two categories? What changes would be needed in the algorithm and experimental designs?
