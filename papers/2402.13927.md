# [The Delusional Hedge Algorithm as a Model of Human Learning from Diverse   Opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13927)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In real-world learning, people often have to learn from the diverse and contradictory opinions of others rather than through direct experience and exposure to ground truth. 
- Existing machine learning models like the hedge algorithm are limited because they assume full supervision with ground truth labels.
- There is a need for models that can capture how people learn which opinions to trust in semi-supervised or unsupervised settings.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a "delusional hedge" algorithm that extends the standard hedge algorithm to accommodate unlabeled data. 
- On unlabeled trials, the delusional hedge computes a "delusional loss" for each source based on the predictions of opposing sources weighted by their trustedness. This allows it to exploit both consensus and trustedness on unlabeled data.

Contributions:
- Introduces a semi-supervised variant of the hedge algorithm ("delusional hedge") that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data.
- Conducts two behavioral experiments evaluating human learning against the predictions of the standard hedge, delusional hedge, and a heuristic baseline.
- Finds that the delusional hedge better captures human ability to integrate trust cues from both labeled and unlabeled data, outperforming the standard hedge.
- Advances understanding of how people learn from diverse, conflicting opinions in more naturalistic semi-supervised settings. 
- Provides a bridge between computational learning theory and cognitive models of human social learning.

In summary, the key idea is that by introducing a delusional loss for unlabeled data, the hedge algorithm can be extended to better model human social learning in semi-supervised real-world settings involving diverse opinions. The two experiments provide evidence that people effectively incorporate both labeled and unlabeled experiences when deciding which information sources to trust.
