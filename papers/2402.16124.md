## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "AVI-Talking: Learning Audio-Visual Instructions for Expressive 3D Talking Face Generation":

Problem:
- Generating realistic 3D facial animations from speech is challenging due to the one-to-many relationship between audio and plausible facial movements. 
- Directly mapping speech to facial motions requires bridging a large modality gap and handling the entanglement between lip movements and speaking style.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose AVI-Talking, an audio-visual instruction framework with two stages:
   1) An audio-visual instruction module that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to comprehend speech and generate descriptive instructions for facial movements. A soft prompting strategy aligns speech features to text embeddings.
   2) A talking face synthesis network that follows the visual instructions to animate a 3D face model, while preserving accurate lip sync. It has a disentangled latent space separating speech content and style. A diffusion prior network maps instructions to the style space.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce visual instructions as an intermediate representation to decompose the speech-to-face generation problem into two more tractable stages.
- Employ LLMs for contextual reasoning on speech content and imaginative instruction generation.
- Propose a disentangled talking face synthesis network with distinct speech content and style spaces. A contrastive learning and diffusion mechanism bridges instructions and styles.  
- Experiments demonstrate the model generates vivid 3D talking faces with precise lip sync and facial expressions consistent with the speech. Both quantitative metrics and user studies showcase superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation is using LLMs to produce facial movement instructions from speech, which guide a parametric face model to generate nuanced and lively 3D talking animations. The two-stage strategy enhanced with neural diffusion achieves interpretable and high-quality results.
