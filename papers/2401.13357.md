# [Linear Relative Pose Estimation Founded on Pose-only Imaging Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13357)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robustly estimating relative camera pose between two views is critical for 3D reconstruction, but handling image matching outliers remains a major challenge. 
- The commonly used essential matrix equation suffers from multiple issues: unable to handle degenerate cases like planar scenes, loses depth information, has multiple solutions.
- State-of-the-art methods like RANSAC require all-inlier minimal samples and have limitations in very high outlier ratios.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a Linear Relative Pose (LiRP) algorithm that can estimate relative pose from ≥6 points and handles degenerate planar cases.
- Embeds the recent Pose-Only imaging geometry that decouples camera pose from scene structure into LiRP to identify outliers. Constructs the Linear Global Translation (LiGT) residual for iterative reweighting.
- Combines LiRP with Graduated Non-Convex Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (GNC-IRLS) method that uses a smooth majorizer function and fast convergence for robustness. 
- Further combines it with RANSAC to deal with very high (>50%) outlier ratios. Allows samples to have some outliers rather than be all inliers.

Main Contributions:
- LiRP algorithm that works with ≥6 points, handles planar degenerate cases, estimates relative pose linearly.
- Uses LiGT residual from Pose-Only geometry for outlier identification in IRLS framework.
- Fusion with GNC-IRLS and RANSAC achieves 2-10x better rotation accuracy than state-of-the-art in up to 80% outlier ratio.
- Real experiments on Strecha dataset also show improved performance over baselines.

In summary, the paper proposes a robust relative pose estimation framework that leverages recent works in Pose-Only geometry and GNC-IRLS, and outperforms state-of-the-art by large margins especially in highly noisy cases.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a linear relative pose estimation algorithm founded on pose-only imaging geometry that is capable of handling planar degenerate scenes and achieving higher accuracy and robustness to outliers compared to existing methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1. It proposes a linear relative pose estimation algorithm (LiRP) based on the essential matrix equation to process all point pairs in one batch. This enhances the estimation accuracy and the capability of handling degenerate planar scenes and pure rotational motion.

2. It introduces the pose-only imaging geometry into the LiRP algorithm to screen outliers. Outlier identification is greatly improved by re-weighting the residual of the linear global translation (LiGT) constraint, thanks to the completeness of the pose-only imaging geometry.  

3. It incorporates the recently proposed graduated non-convex iteratively reweighted least squares (GNC-IRLS) method and RANSAC into the LiRP algorithm for further improving robustness. 

4. Simulations and experiments on the Strecha dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves 2-10 times improvement in relative rotation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, in the presence of up to 80% outliers.

In summary, the main contribution is a robust linear relative pose estimation algorithm that can handle degenerate motion and large fractions of outliers. This is achieved by combining the pose-only imaging geometry, GNC-IRLS, and RANSAC within a linear formulation.

The paper introduces a linear relative pose estimation algorithm founded on pose-only imaging geometry to handle planar degenerate scenes and remove outliers. It proposes using the LiGT constraint and residual statistics like vLiGT within an IRLS and GNC framework. It also combines this with RANSAC to further improve robustness, especially at higher outlier ratios. The six-point algorithm and action matrix are used to solve for the essential matrix. Key goals are enhancing accuracy and robustness of two-view relative pose estimation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a linear relative pose estimation algorithm (LiRP) that handles planar degenerate scenes for n≥6 point pairs. How does this algorithm differ from previous linear methods like the 5-point and 6-point algorithms that suffer from planar degeneracy issues?

2. The LiRP algorithm embeds the linear global translation (LiGT) constraint into the iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) framework. What is the benefit of using the LiGT constraint over the essential matrix constraint in this context? 

3. The paper shows that using the LiGT residual statistic vLiGT yields higher accuracy than other residuals like vE or vBA when combined with the majorization and superlinear GNC schedule. Why does vLiGT perform the best?

4. How does the proposed LiRP algorithm construct the essential matrix from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the A matrix? Explain the two cases considered (c=1 and c=0).  

5. The GNC-IRLS pose estimation algorithm requires setting certain parameters like stop threshold ε0, maximum iterations niter, and initial weights w0. How should these parameters be set and what is their impact on performance?

6. Explain how the proposed GNC-RANSAC algorithm relaxes the requirement that all RANSAC sub-samples must be all inliers. What threshold is used instead?

7. In the synthetic experiments, why does the N-point method perform poorly compared to the results reported in the cited paper? What simulation issue caused this discrepancy?

8. For the real Strecha dataset experiments, the paper identifies higher outlier percentages than OpenGV. What causes these additional outliers and how does GNC-RANSAC handle them?

9. The global translations are estimated by the LiGT algorithm. How does the linear nature and completeness property of LiGT contribute to the overall accuracy of the reconstruction pipeline?

10. The paper focuses primarily on improving the relative rotation accuracy. What further work could be done to also improve the relative translation accuracy within this framework?
