# [CMP: Cooperative Motion Prediction with Multi-Agent Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17916)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current autonomous vehicles rely heavily on onboard sensors for perception and prediction, which is insufficient in complex environments with occlusions or limited visibility. 
- Prior works on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication focus separately on cooperative perception or motion prediction. No existing methods comprehensively address cooperative capabilities spanning both perception and prediction.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes the first framework, called CMP, that enables connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) to cooperate in both perception and motion prediction based on raw LiDAR data.
- The cooperative perception module detects and tracks objects by sharing intermediate LiDAR features between CAVs. This leverages multiple viewpoints to improve situational awareness.
- The motion prediction module first predicts future trajectories individually using a transformer-based model. Then a novel prediction aggregation mechanism fuses motion predictions from different CAVs to refine the outputs.  

Main Contributions:
- First practical framework that realizes cooperation for both perception and prediction, advancing CAVs' capability of understanding complex environments.
- Lightweight data representation and compression techniques to meet real-world V2X bandwidth constraints.
- Transformer-based prediction aggregation module to effectively combine motion predictions from multiple CAVs.
- Extensive experiments show enhanced performance over no cooperation baseline, including 17.2% lower prediction error and more accurate object detection and tracking.

In summary, this pioneering work pushes forward the state-of-the-art in cooperative automated driving by enabling synergistic vehicle-to-vehicle communications to boost environmental perception and motion forecasting accuracy. The proposed CMP framework significantly improves awareness and prediction capabilities of individual CAVs.
