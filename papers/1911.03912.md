# [Effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for speech recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03912)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is:What are effective self-supervised pre-training methods for speech recognition, and how does quantizing/discretizing the inputs compare to directly learning representations from continuous speech inputs?The key hypotheses tested are:1) Learning discrete representations of speech through vector quantization, followed by pre-training a BERT model over these discrete units, will be more effective than directly learning representations from continuous speech inputs.2) Pre-training BERT models with self-supervision will improve performance in low-resource speech recognition scenarios with limited labeled data. 3) Two-step pre-training with discrete unit discovery followed by BERT pre-training provides complementary benefits compared to single-step pre-training methods like wav2vec.The paper systematically compares different self-supervised pre-training approaches, with and without explicit quantization of the speech inputs, across varying amounts of labeled data. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of pre-training, particularly discrete unit discovery, for low-resource speech recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:- They compare different self-supervised representation learning approaches for speech recognition, including methods that explicitly quantize the speech signal versus methods that learn representations directly from the continuous signal. - They show that first quantizing the speech into discrete units with vq-wav2vec, and then pre-training a BERT model over these discrete units ("Discrete BERT") works better than learning representations directly from the continuous speech ("Continuous BERT").- They demonstrate that directly fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT models with a CTC loss for speech recognition gives better results than using the BERT features in tandem with a separate downstream ASR model as in previous work.- Their Discrete BERT model pre-trained on unlabeled Librispeech and fine-tuned on just 1 hour of labeled data outperforms the previous state-of-the-art result using 100 hours of labeled data.- With only 10 minutes of labeled data, their approach achieves 16.3/25.2 WER on the Librispeech test-clean/test-other benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of pre-training for low-resource speech recognition.In summary, they systematically compare different self-supervised pre-training methods and show strong results by first quantizing with vq-wav2vec, then pre-training BERT on the discrete units, and directly fine-tuning the BERT model, outperforming previous approaches especially in low labeled data settings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper compares self-supervised speech representation learning methods, finding that first discovering discrete units of the audio data with vq-wav2vec and then pre-training a BERT model over these units leads to the best performance; this approach outperforms directly learning representations from continuous speech features.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper compares several different self-supervised representation learning approaches for speech recognition. The key findings of the paper are:- They compare methods that explicitly quantize/discretize the audio data (vq-wav2vec, k-means clustering) versus methods that learn directly on continuous inputs (wav2vec, raw MFCC/FBANK features). The quantization methods work better, showing that discrete unit discovery is an important first step before pre-training representations.- Pre-training representation models (Discrete BERT and Continuous BERT) leads to much better results compared to just using the features without pre-training, especially when labeled data is limited. This demonstrates the value of self-supervised pre-training.- Their best model, which quantizes audio with vq-wav2vec and then pre-trains a BERT model over the discrete units, achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work on Librispeech with only 10 hours of labeled data. It nearly matches performance of a prior model trained on 100x more labeled data.Some key comparisons to related work:- They outperform the CPC-based model of Kawakami et al. (2019) which also pre-trains representations on Librispeech but uses more labeled data (96h vs 1h/10min) to train the ASR model.- Their model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art result on Librispeech test-other using 100h labeled data, while using only 10h labeled data.- They show gains over directly fine-tuning the wav2vec model, demonstrating the value of stacking multiple levels of representation learning.- Their work follows the paradigm of other recent self-supervised speech models like wav2vec, vq-wav2vec, and CPC, but introduces the idea of discretizing the representations before BERT pre-training which proves very effective.Overall, this paper provides a strong empirical comparison of different self-supervised approaches and shows quantization + BERT pre-training is a simple but very effective recipe for learning powerful speech representations, especially in low resource settings. The results clearly advance the state-of-the-art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:- Testing the model on a larger amount of unlabeled data that is more acoustically challenging. They mention trying unlabeled data that is 1000x larger in volume.- Exploring multi-lingual and cross-lingual transfer learning extensions of the model. They suggest this could help with low-resource languages.- Trying different self-supervised objectives for the continuous BERT model instead of just the InfoNCE loss. They suggest that better acoustic representations could further improve the continuous BERT model.- Applying the approach to other speech tasks beyond just automatic speech recognition, such as speaker identification.- Evaluating the learned discrete representations from vq-wav2vec on other downstream tasks to better understand what acoustic information they capture.- Exploring different model architectures besides the Transformer for both the discrete and continuous BERT models.In summary, the main future directions mentioned are using much larger unlabeled datasets, multi-lingual modeling, improving the continuous BERT representations, applying the approach to other speech tasks, and analyzing and improving the model architectures. The authors frame the paper as an initial systematic comparison of self-supervised speech recognition approaches, suggesting there are many possible extensions to explore in future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper compares self-supervised representation learning algorithms for speech recognition. The key findings are:- They find that first learning discrete representations of the raw audio data through vector quantization, followed by BERT pre-training on the discrete units, works better than directly learning representations from the continuous audio data. The initial discrete unit discovery helps build an effective vocabulary for subsequent BERT training.- Fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model directly on transcribed speech using CTC loss gives better results than previous approaches of feeding the representations into a separate task-specific ASR model.- Pre-training on unlabeled Librispeech data and fine-tuning on just 1 hour of labeled data can outperform the previous best result using 100 hours of labeled data. With only 10 minutes of labeled data, the proposed approach still achieves decent WER of 16.3 on test-clean and 25.2 on test-other.- The results demonstrate that self-supervision enables building ASR systems using a minimal amount of labeled data, reducing the dependence on large labeled datasets. Vector quantization followed by BERT pre-training is an effective approach for self-supervised speech representation learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:This paper compares self-supervised representation learning algorithms for speech recognition. The researchers find that the most effective approach is to first learn a discrete vocabulary of audio units (phonemes, etc.) using the vq-wav2vec method. This quantizes the raw audio into discrete tokens. Then a BERT model is trained on top of these tokens using a masked language modeling objective, where some tokens are masked out and the model must predict them. This two-step process of first quantizing the audio and then learning representations on top of it outperforms directly learning representations from continuous audio features. The discrete vocabulary enables better representation learning in the subsequent BERT pre-training.The researchers pre-train models on 960 hours of Librispeech and fine-tune on limited labeled data from 10 hours down to 10 minutes. The BERT model pre-trained on vq-wav2vec discrete units substantially outperforms alternatives and previous benchmarks. When fine-tuned on just 1 hour of labeled data, it surpasses the best previous result using 100 hours of labeled data. With 10 minutes of labeled data, it still achieves good performance of 16.3/25.2 WER on the test-clean/test-other benchmarks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for enabling speech recognition with minimal labeled data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper compares different self-supervised representation learning methods for speech recognition. The key findings are:The most effective method is a two-step approach. First, a discrete vocabulary is learned from the raw audio using vq-wav2vec. This discovers meaningful acoustic units. Second, a standard BERT model is pretrained on these discrete units using a masked language modeling objective. This captures the sequential structure. The BERT model pretrained on discrete units from vq-wav2vec substantially outperforms directly learning representations from the continuous speech, using either raw audio or spectral features like MFCC or FBANK. The initial discrete unit discovery enables more effective subsequent representation learning.The pretrained BERT model is directly fine-tuned on transcribed speech using a CTC loss for speech recognition, instead of using it as a feature extractor for another model. When finetuned on just 10 mins of labeled data, this approach achieves 16.3/25.2 WER on Librispeech test-clean/other. This demonstrates the effectiveness of self-supervision for speech recognition with near-zero labeled data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is comparing different self-supervised representation learning algorithms for speech recognition. Specifically, it is comparing approaches that explicitly quantize the audio data versus approaches that learn representations without quantization. The key questions it is trying to answer are:1) Is it better to first quantize the audio data into discrete units and then learn representations on top of that (e.g. through BERT pre-training), or is it better to learn representations directly on the continuous audio data?2) How do different input features (raw audio, spectral features, learned features like wav2vec) compare when used with these self-supervised approaches?3) Can these self-supervised pre-training approaches allow speech recognition with very limited labeled data, even just 10 minutes? How does the performance compare to previous supervised approaches?So in summary, it is systematically comparing different self-supervised pre-training methods on speech data and evaluating their effectiveness, especially in low-resource settings with limited labeled data. A core question is whether the two-step approach of quantization plus representation learning is better than end-to-end representation learning on the raw audio.
