# [Persistent self-supervised learning principle: from stereo to monocular   vision for obstacle avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08047)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can a robot keep performing its task when its original sensor that provides a trusted cue breaks down or becomes unavailable? More specifically, the paper investigates a persistent form of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in which a flying robot initially uses stereo vision to avoid obstacles. Over time, it learns to estimate distances using monocular appearance cues based on the stereo vision cue. The goal is for the robot to be able to switch to relying solely on monocular vision for obstacle avoidance if the stereo vision fails. The key hypothesis seems to be that by using the "training wheels" strategy, where the robot switches to monocular-based control but keeps stereo vision active in the background to override collisions, the robot can safely explore new situations encountered when relying on the learned monocular cue alone. This allows it to continually improve its monocular distance estimation and avoid the "feedback-induced data bias" problem.In summary, the central research question is how a robot can keep performing a task when its original trusted sensor breaks down, using persistent SSL to learn a complementary sensor cue that remains functional after the loss of the original cue. The key hypothesis is that the "training wheels" strategy enables safe and continual learning to support this persistent form of SSL.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of the behavioral consequences of using a persistent self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme, in which the signal from the trained algorithm remains useful even when the supervisory signal is cut off. Specifically, the paper studies a flying robot with stereo vision that uses SSL to learn monocular depth estimation for obstacle avoidance. It introduces a strategy where the robot initially relies on stereo vision and then switches to primarily using monocular vision, keeping stereo as "training wheels" to avoid collisions. The paper shows this approach handles the "feedback-induced data bias" problem known from learning from demonstration. Simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the robot can successfully navigate using monocular vision after a short learning period.The key findings are:- Persistent SSL induces different training and test distributions like in learning from demonstration, requiring specific strategies. The "training wheels" method is effective.- Real-world experiments show the potential of persistent SSL to enhance robot capabilities through online sensor-based learning.- The abundant SSL training data enables gathering large datasets suitable for deep learning.So in summary, the paper demonstrates persistent SSL as a promising learning approach for robotics and studies the behavioral aspects when the learned function remains useful after the supervisory signal is gone.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes and demonstrates a method called persistent self-supervised learning, in which a robot uses trusted sensor inputs (e.g. stereo vision) to train a complementary sensor (e.g. monocular vision) for the same task, and can safely switch to relying only on the trained complementary sensor by using the trusted sensor as a 'safety net' during the transition.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on persistent self-supervised learning compares to other research on self-supervised learning and robot navigation:- It focuses on the behavioral aspects of persistent SSL, where the robot must keep performing its task even when the original supervisory sensor cue becomes unavailable. Most prior SSL work has focused only on short-term learning within a single snapshot of data. - The authors frame persistent SSL as similar to learning from demonstration, with the issue of feedback-induced data bias. They propose and test behavioral strategies like "training wheels" to handle this bias. This provides a new perspective compared to typical SSL or LfD work.- The robotic experiments demonstrate persistent SSL by training a drone to fly based solely on monocular vision after an initial period of stereo supervision. Prior SSL robot studies like on the DARPA car Stanley focused more on short-term terrain classification.- The monocular navigation task connects SSL to contemporary computer vision research on single image depth estimation. The self-supervised aspect provides abundant training data.- The work views persistent SSL as combining advantages of supervised learning (easy training) and reinforcement learning (adaptation to unforeseen situations) without their main downsides. This positions it as a unique learning approach for robotics.In summary, this paper provides both a formalization of persistent SSL and demonstrations of its potential for robotic learning, with comparisons to related techniques. The behavioral strategies and framing in terms of overcoming data bias are novel contributions to the field.
