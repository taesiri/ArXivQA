# [Persistent self-supervised learning principle: from stereo to monocular   vision for obstacle avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08047)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can a robot keep performing its task when its original sensor that provides a trusted cue breaks down or becomes unavailable? More specifically, the paper investigates a persistent form of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in which a flying robot initially uses stereo vision to avoid obstacles. Over time, it learns to estimate distances using monocular appearance cues based on the stereo vision cue. The goal is for the robot to be able to switch to relying solely on monocular vision for obstacle avoidance if the stereo vision fails. The key hypothesis seems to be that by using the "training wheels" strategy, where the robot switches to monocular-based control but keeps stereo vision active in the background to override collisions, the robot can safely explore new situations encountered when relying on the learned monocular cue alone. This allows it to continually improve its monocular distance estimation and avoid the "feedback-induced data bias" problem.In summary, the central research question is how a robot can keep performing a task when its original trusted sensor breaks down, using persistent SSL to learn a complementary sensor cue that remains functional after the loss of the original cue. The key hypothesis is that the "training wheels" strategy enables safe and continual learning to support this persistent form of SSL.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of the behavioral consequences of using a persistent self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme, in which the signal from the trained algorithm remains useful even when the supervisory signal is cut off. Specifically, the paper studies a flying robot with stereo vision that uses SSL to learn monocular depth estimation for obstacle avoidance. It introduces a strategy where the robot initially relies on stereo vision and then switches to primarily using monocular vision, keeping stereo as "training wheels" to avoid collisions. The paper shows this approach handles the "feedback-induced data bias" problem known from learning from demonstration. Simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the robot can successfully navigate using monocular vision after a short learning period.The key findings are:- Persistent SSL induces different training and test distributions like in learning from demonstration, requiring specific strategies. The "training wheels" method is effective.- Real-world experiments show the potential of persistent SSL to enhance robot capabilities through online sensor-based learning.- The abundant SSL training data enables gathering large datasets suitable for deep learning.So in summary, the paper demonstrates persistent SSL as a promising learning approach for robotics and studies the behavioral aspects when the learned function remains useful after the supervisory signal is gone.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes and demonstrates a method called persistent self-supervised learning, in which a robot uses trusted sensor inputs (e.g. stereo vision) to train a complementary sensor (e.g. monocular vision) for the same task, and can safely switch to relying only on the trained complementary sensor by using the trusted sensor as a 'safety net' during the transition.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on persistent self-supervised learning compares to other research on self-supervised learning and robot navigation:- It focuses on the behavioral aspects of persistent SSL, where the robot must keep performing its task even when the original supervisory sensor cue becomes unavailable. Most prior SSL work has focused only on short-term learning within a single snapshot of data. - The authors frame persistent SSL as similar to learning from demonstration, with the issue of feedback-induced data bias. They propose and test behavioral strategies like "training wheels" to handle this bias. This provides a new perspective compared to typical SSL or LfD work.- The robotic experiments demonstrate persistent SSL by training a drone to fly based solely on monocular vision after an initial period of stereo supervision. Prior SSL robot studies like on the DARPA car Stanley focused more on short-term terrain classification.- The monocular navigation task connects SSL to contemporary computer vision research on single image depth estimation. The self-supervised aspect provides abundant training data.- The work views persistent SSL as combining advantages of supervised learning (easy training) and reinforcement learning (adaptation to unforeseen situations) without their main downsides. This positions it as a unique learning approach for robotics.In summary, this paper provides both a formalization of persistent SSL and demonstrations of its potential for robotic learning, with comparisons to related techniques. The behavioral strategies and framing in terms of overcoming data bias are novel contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Using longer learning times to accumulate more training data over multiple flights. This could allow for the use of more complex learning methods like deep neural networks that require large amounts of data. The authors suggest that with improved hardware, close-to state-of-the-art deep learning models could be trained and run on drones.- Using learning methods like Gaussian processes that provide uncertainty estimates along with their predictions. This uncertainty could be used to better integrate the behavior with the learning, for example by adapting the drone's speed based on the certainty of the distance estimates.- Extending the learning from a single disparity value to full dense depth maps. Again, this could be enabled by larger datasets and more complex learning methods. - Applying the persistent SSL principle to other types of applications, such as using the future as ground truth or using it for advanced sensory integration where the ground truth could be partially improved by the complementary cue.- Further investigation into the effects of imperfect ground truth data on the persistent SSL estimator. The authors encountered some issues with unreliable stereo data during experiments.- Developing better methods to detect when the learned estimator becomes invalid, for example due to changes in the environment. This could allow the robot to switch back to using the ground truth and re-enter learning mode.In general, the authors suggest that persistent SSL has significant potential for enhancing robot robustness by allowing for continued learning during operation. Applying it successfully will require advances in areas like uncertainty modeling, behavioral strategies, and complex learning methods that can scale to large datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates a novel form of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for robots, called persistent SSL, in which the robot continues performing its task after the original supervisory signal becomes unavailable. The authors study this in the context of a flying robot using stereo vision to avoid obstacles, while learning to estimate distances from monocular cues. They introduce a strategy where the robot initially flies with stereo vision but switches to relying primarily on monocular vision after some learning, using stereo only as "training wheels" to avoid collisions. This mitigates the "feedback-induced data bias" problem faced in persistent SSL. Simulations and real-world experiments with an AR drone show the feasibility of this approach, with the robot successfully avoiding obstacles using monocular vision after a few minutes of learning. The abundance of training data from the robot's own sensors is noted as beneficial for gathering large datasets needed for deep learning. The paper also relates persistent SSL to other machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning and learning from demonstration. Overall, it demonstrates the potential of persistent SSL as a robust learning method to enhance robot capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces the concept of persistent self-supervised learning (SSL) for robots. SSL is a technique where a robot uses outputs from a trusted sensor as supervision to train a machine learning model to interpret a complementary sensor. Persistent SSL refers to continuing to use the learned model even when the trusted sensor becomes unavailable. The authors apply persistent SSL to train a drone to estimate distances using monocular camera images, with stereo vision providing distance ground truth for training. They show this setup is similar to learning from demonstration and compare training strategies in simulation. The best strategy is to primarily fly using monocular vision after initial training, with stereo overrides to prevent collisions. Real-world drone experiments demonstrate the feasibility of persistent SSL for monocular obstacle avoidance. The robot successfully navigates a room using vision from a single camera trained via SSL. The abundant training data enables gathering large datasets suitable for deep learning. The results illustrate the potential of persistent SSL as a robust learning technique to enhance robot capabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a persistent form of self-supervised learning (SSL) for robots to learn complementary sensor cues. In persistent SSL, the robot initially relies on a trusted sensor cue to perform its task. This trusted cue provides supervised labels that allow the robot to train online to recognize an additional complementary sensor cue. Importantly, the method enables the robot to keep performing its task even when the original trusted sensor cue becomes unavailable. The authors demonstrate this through a proof-of-concept scenario in which a flying robot uses stereo vision to avoid obstacles and simultaneously learns to estimate distances using monocular vision. The robot initially avoids obstacles using stereo disparities. Over time, it switches to navigating based on the learned monocular disparities, while still using stereo vision in the background as "training wheels" to avoid collisions. This allows the robot to safely explore new situations encountered when relying solely on monocular vision. The method is shown to enable persistent learning and successful monocular obstacle avoidance in both simulations and real-world experiments.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how a robot's learning behavior should be organized in persistent self-supervised learning, so that the robot can continue performing its task when the original sensory cue becomes unavailable. The specific context is a flying robot that uses stereo vision to avoid obstacles. It wants to learn a mapping from monocular appearance cues to stereo-based distance estimates, so that it can rely on just a single camera if the stereo fails.The key question is how to handle the "feedback-induced data bias" problem that arises when the robot starts acting on the learned monocular cues. Since these cues will not be identical to stereo, the robot's behavior and encountered states will differ from when it was learning. This can cause the performance to degrade over time.The paper explores different behavioral strategies during the learning process to best enable the robot to keep avoiding obstacles using the learned monocular cues alone. This includes using the stereo solely as "training wheels" to override collisions while mainly flying by monocular vision.Overall, the paper is studying how to organize persistent self-supervised learning so the robot can maintain its capabilities when the original sensory cue becomes unavailable, which requires addressing the feedback-induced data bias issue.
