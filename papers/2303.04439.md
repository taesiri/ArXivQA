# [A Light Weight Model for Active Speaker Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04439)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to design a lightweight and efficient model for active speaker detection. The key hypothesis is that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance on active speaker detection with a much smaller and faster model by:

1. Inputting only a single candidate face sequence instead of multiple candidates. 

2. Splitting 3D convolutions into separate 2D and 1D convolutions for more efficient visual feature extraction.

3. Splitting 2D convolutions into 1D convolutions for more efficient audio feature extraction.

4. Using a simple GRU module instead of complex attention modules for cross-modal modeling.

The paper proposes a full framework incorporating these ideas and conducts extensive experiments on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker benchmark to test the hypothesis. The results validate the hypothesis, showing the proposed lightweight model achieves 94.1% mAP accuracy using 23x fewer parameters and 4x less computation than prior state-of-the-art methods. This demonstrates it is possible to build highly accurate yet extremely efficient models for active speaker detection.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that with careful, lightweight design, active speaker detection can be done precisely and efficiently. The experiments confirm this central hypothesis and research question of the paper.
