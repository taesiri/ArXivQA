# [Primary and Secondary Factor Consistency as Domain Knowledge to Guide   Happiness Computing in Online Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12398)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Happiness computing models based on online data are being used to understand factors that contribute to people's happiness. However, different models can produce different explanations for happiness predictions, making it hard to know which factors are truly most important.  
- Two key challenges: (1) How to represent domain knowledge like the primary and secondary relationships between happiness factors; (2) How to use this knowledge to improve model training.

Proposed Solution:
- Empirically demonstrate the explanation inconsistency among popular happiness computing models on the same datasets.
- Prove multiple models with additive factor attributions like Shapley values have consistent primary/secondary factor relationships.
- Represent the factor relationships as importance distributions to encode domain knowledge.
- Use Kullback-Leibler divergence loss between model attributions and domain knowledge distributions to regularize training.

Main Contributions:
- Provide evidence that happiness computing models produce inconsistent explanations. 
- Theoretically prove consistency of primary/secondary factors among additive models.
- Novel method to encode factor relationships as distributions and use them to improve training.
- Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate improvements in accuracy and explanation consistency when using the domain knowledge, allowing models to better predict happiness for the right reasons.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of inconsistent explanations from happiness computing models, proposes representing domain knowledge as factor importance distributions, and uses this to improve both prediction accuracy and explanation faithfulness. The results have implications for supporting decision-making based on model predictions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using domain knowledge of primary and secondary factor relations, represented as importance distributions, to guide happiness computing model training for improved accuracy and explanation consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating that there is factor explanation difference among popular happiness computing models even when using the same explanation methods and datasets. 

2. The authors theoretically prove that multiple computing models with additive factor attribution have the desirable property of primary and secondary factor relation consistency. The relations with quantity are represented as importance distributions for encoding domain knowledge, which is then used to constrain the models' training.

3. The proposed method is implemented on four specific groups in the online web data Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) and the European Social Survey (ESS). The results verify improvements in terms of accuracy, with reliability further confirmed through implications for online happiness assessment.

In summary, the main contribution is using domain knowledge such as primary and secondary factor relations to constrain happiness computing models, which improves accuracy and explanation consistency.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper utilizes domain knowledge of primary and secondary factor relations to guide model training. Why is representing and introducing this domain knowledge important for improving the consistency and trustworthiness of happiness computing models?

2. The paper proves that multiple prediction models with additive factor attributions will have the desirable property of primary and secondary factor relation consistency. Walk through the details of this proof and explain why this property is significant. 

3. The paper represents factor relations with quantity as an importance distribution for encoding domain knowledge. Explain how this distribution is calculated and why using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to compare distributions is appropriate.

4. The global importance distribution combines distributions across multiple models. Discuss the rationale behind this approach and why it leads to more robust domain knowledge representations. 

5. How specifically does the paper implement model training guidance using the formulated domain knowledge representations? Walk through the details of the joint training loss function.
