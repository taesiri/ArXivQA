# [Resolving Regular Polysemy in Named Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09758)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Word sense disambiguation (WSD) focuses on disambiguating common words against a predefined sense inventory. In contrast, named entities are usually considered to refer to a real-world referent. However, proper names can also exhibit ambiguity through a process called "appellativization", where they act like common words with different meanings.

- These ambiguities of proper names can be analyzed through the framework of regular polysemy. However, existing computational models either focus just on WSD for common words or regular polysemy, but not both. 

- There is also a lack of sense-labeled datasets that cover both common words and proper names for Chinese.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a combined WSD model to disambiguate both common words against Chinese WordNet (CWN) and proper names as "dot objects" describing different facets of the referent.

- A dataset of 45k examples is constructed from CWN and an additional 28k manually sense-annotated sentences. 

- For proper names, a dataset of 4k instances is built from social media posts, with proper names grouped into 7 dot object types based on Wikidata ontology.

- A gloss-based neural architecture is adopted that handles both CWN sense inventory and dot objects for proper names in a flexible way.

Main Contributions:
- A unified WSD model for jointly handling regular polysemy in proper names and sense enumeration of common words.

- New datasets for Chinese that has sense annotations for both common words and proper names.

- Demonstrated that the flexibility of gloss-based models can effectively exploit lexical resources for WSD and extend to proper name ambiguities.  

- The model achieves 0.86 F1 on common word WSD and 0.88 accuracy on proper name dot object prediction.

In summary, the key innovation is a combined computational model for lexical ambiguity resolution of both common and proper nouns by unifying two linguistic notions of sense inventory and regular polysemy. The results on new Chinese datasets also showcase the potential of neural gloss-based models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a combined word sense disambiguation model to resolve lexical ambiguities in both common words against Chinese WordNet and proper names through regular polysemy represented as dot objects, achieving competitive performance on both tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a combined word sense disambiguation (WSD) model to disambiguate both common words against Chinese Wordnet (CWN) and proper names as dot objects representing different types of regular polysemy. Specifically:

1) The paper collects and manually annotates datasets of common words mapped to CWN senses, as well as proper names mapped to dot object types representing regular polysemy categories. 

2) A unified supervised WSD model based on GlossBERT is built leveraging both the sense definitions and example sentences in CWN. This allows the flexibility to accommodate both enumerated senses for common words and dot object types for proper names.

3) Experiments show the model achieves competitive performance on disambiguating both common and proper nouns on the datasets. This demonstrates the feasibility of a unified WSD approach for both types of words.

4) The model not only serves as a practical disambiguation tool but also facilitates future development of lexical resources like CWN, by helping expand sense coverage using contextualized embeddings.

In summary, the key contribution is using a uniform WSD modeling approach to resolve ambiguities in both common and proper names via an enumerated sense inventory and dot objects respectively. The flexibility of the architecture and promising results support this unified disambiguation capability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Word sense disambiguation (WSD)
- Named entity recognition (NER) 
- Named entity disambiguation (NED)
- Entity linking (EL)
- Regular polysemy
- Dot objects
- Chinese WordNet (CWN)
- GlossBERT
- Contextualized embeddings
- Weak supervision

The paper focuses on addressing lexical ambiguity resolution of both common nouns (using Chinese WordNet as the sense inventory) and proper nouns (modeling them as instances of regular polysemy and dot objects). It leverages a gloss-based neural architecture similar to GlossBERT that is trained on both an WSD dataset and a dataset of proper nouns with regular polysemy annotations. The model utilizes contextualized embeddings and weak supervision to achieve competitive performance on disambiguating both common and proper nouns.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to model the ambiguities of proper names through the perspective of regular polysemy. Could you elaborate more on why proper names exhibit ambiguities even though they are supposed to refer to an ad-hoc real world referent? What are some examples of such ambiguities?

2. The paper categorizes the polysemous behaviors of proper names into 7 dot object types. What are these 7 dot object types and what do they represent? Could you provide some examples of proper names for each dot object type? 

3. The unified WSD model proposed leverages a gloss-based model architecture. Why is this architecture suitable for disambiguating against both an enumerated sense inventory (CWN) and dot objects for proper names? What modifications were made to the original GlossBERT model?

4. The model is trained on two datasets - one for WSD using CWN, and another for proper name regular polysemy. Walk through the process of constructing both datasets. What are some challenges faced and how were they addressed?

5. The proper name polysemy dataset links proper names to Wikidata categories, which are then mapped to dot objects. Explain this mapping process and provide some examples of mappings between Wikidata categories and dot objects.

6. What is the model input format for both WSD and proper name disambiguation? How do the context-gloss pairs differ between the two tasks? Provide some examples of input sequences. 

7. The model achieves 86% accuracy on WSD and 88% on proper name disambiguation. Analyze these results - are certain dot object types or word types harder to disambiguate? How does the model compare to baselines?

8. Aside from overall accuracy, what other model behaviors demonstrate that it has properly learned to disambiguate word senses rather than rely on simple cues?

9. The paper mentions that the model not only serves as a practical NLP tool but also helps further develop the lexical resource. Elaborate further on how the model can facilitate future development of CWN.

10. The paper proposes some future work like improving dot object assignment and extending regular polysemy to common words. Discuss how these future directions can improve the model's capabilities.
