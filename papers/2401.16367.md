# [TQCompressor: improving tensor decomposition methods in neural networks   via permutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16367)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained language models like GPT-2 have high computational and storage demands, making their deployment difficult in resource-constrained environments. 
- Existing compression techniques like matrix factorization can reduce model size but often suffer drops in performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new compression method called "TQCompressed" that enhances Kronecker decomposition with permutations. 
- It rearranges the neuron connections in weight matrices through permutations, making the matrices more amenable to factorization while preserving model functionality.
- An iterative compression algorithm alternates between finding optimal permutations and applying Kronecker decomposition to refine the approximation.

Application to GPT-2:
- The method is applied to compress GPT-2 small from 124 million parameters to 81 million. 
- Only the embedding, feedforward, and classifier layers are decomposed, excluding the attention layers.
- A training strategy with incremental knowledge distillation is used to recover the performance, using just 3.1% of the OpenWebText dataset.

Results: 
- The compressed TQCompressedGPT-2 model achieves state-of-the-art results compared to DistilGPT-2 and KnGPT-2 in terms of perplexity on Wikitext, Lambada and using far less training data.
- This demonstrates the method's effectiveness at reducing model size while maintaining accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Novel permutation algorithm to enhance matrix factorization techniques for neural network compression. 
- Iterative compression methodology combining permutations and Kronecker decomposition.
- State-of-the-art compressed GPT-2 model that matches original model performance with 70% of the parameters.
- Advances model compression capabilities to facilitate deployment of large language models in resource-constrained environments.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative permutation-based compression technique that reduces GPT-2's size substantially without compromising its performance. The results highlight the potential of this method to compress large neural network models for efficient deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel compression method for neural networks that enhances Kronecker decomposition through optimal permutations of weight matrices, enabling reduced model size while preserving performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of a new permutation algorithm designed to enhance the efficacy of matrix factorization methods for neural network compression. Specifically, the algorithm involves optimally permuting neuron connections in weight matrices before applying tensor decomposition. This rearrangement makes the network more amenable to factorization while preserving its functionality, enabling more efficient approximation of each layer. 

The paper showcases this method by applying it, in combination with Kronecker decomposition, to compress the GPT-2 small model. This results in the TQCompressedGPT-2 model with 81 million parameters (compared to 124 million originally) yet maintains high performance levels. The compressed model is made publicly available along with the code.

Additionally, a multi-step knowledge distillation training strategy is proposed that further enhances the performance of TQCompressedGPT-2 while using only a small fraction (3.1%) of the original training data. Comparative evaluations show the method surpasses existing compressed GPT-2 variants.

So in summary, the main novelty is the permutation algorithm to improve tensor decomposition for neural network compression, demonstrated on GPT-2 and enhanced via an efficient knowledge distillation approach. The method advances state-of-the-art in efficient model deployment.
