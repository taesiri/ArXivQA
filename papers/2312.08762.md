# [Multi-modal Latent Space Learning for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08762)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called Diffusion Process enhanced Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (DPMM-CoT) to improve complex reasoning abilities of language models using both text and image inputs. The key idea is to learn a deep latent space that fuses representations from both modalities using a diffusion process, allowing the model to align textual and visual information. This fused latent space aims to provide the language model with more useful semantic information to generate logical rationales and infer correct answers. The method adopts a two-stage framework consisting of rationale generation and answer inference. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the ScienceQA benchmark, outperforming prior multi-modal Chain-of-Thought methods. Additional experiments on multi-modal machine translation also demonstrate the wider applicability of the proposed latent space learning technique to enhance multi-modal reasoning. The results suggest diffusion processes enable deeper understanding of flexible visual features aligned with textual thoughts, enhancing the language model's ability to leverage multi-modal information effectively.
