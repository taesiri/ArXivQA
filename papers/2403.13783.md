## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a fundamental dichotomy between the discrete rigid body assumptions underlying conventional robot simulation and the continuum mechanics assumptions of the Material Point Method (MPM). Integrating MPM with rigid body dynamics to handle frictional contact robustly and accurately remains an open challenge. Prior attempts based on explicit time integration suffer from stability issues.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces the first implicit integration between deformable bodies discretized with MPM and articulated rigid bodies coupled through tight frictional contact. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate the MPM dynamics as a convex optimization problem to ensure efficiency and stability. 

2) Design a new elastoplastic constitutive model with a return mapping algorithm that maintains convexity.

3) Leverage a recent convex frictional contact formulation and extend it to handle contacts between rigid bodies and deformable bodies represented in MPM.

Main Contributions:

- A novel convex formulation for MPM dynamics that guarantees global convergence even for large time steps.

- A corotational elastoplastic material model with an efficient return mapping algorithm that keeps the optimization convex.

- The first rigorous integration between deformable bodies in MPM and articulated rigid bodies through implicit frictional contact coupling.  

- Demonstrated superior accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art methods in complex contact scenarios relevant for robot manipulation.

- An open-source implementation integrated into the Drake toolkit to facilitate advanced robotics simulation.

The method is validated on diverse examples that showcase its versatility in simulating challenging phenomena like fracture, plastic flow, and multiphase behaviors. Comparisons also highlight improvements over prior state-of-the-art in stability and accuracy for manipulating deformable objects.

8) The paper highlights that their method works with non-convex energies as well, as long as the matrix A remains SPD. Can you explain why this is the case and discuss what types of material models could exploit this?

9) The paper compares performance against ManiSkill2 and shows cases where the proposed method is more accurate and stable. Can you analyze the fundamental reasons behind this improved accuracy and stability?
