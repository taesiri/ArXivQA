# [Mega-TTS: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech at Scale with Intrinsic Inductive   Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03509)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we design an effective large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) system that incorporates proper inductive biases for different aspects of speech? The key hypotheses are:1) Speech can be decomposed into several attributes like content, timbre, prosody, and phase, each with distinct properties. Modeling them separately with proper inductive biases can improve TTS performance.2) Using mel-spectrogram instead of raw waveform as the intermediate representation allows separating phase from other attributes. Phase can be reconstructed separately. 3) Timbre is a global attribute that changes slowly, so a global vector is suitable for representing it.4) Prosody has both local and long-range dependencies, making autoregressive language models ideal for modeling it.5) Content has a monotonic alignment with speech, which autoregressive models may not guarantee.So the overall goal is to design a large-scale TTS system called Mega-TTS that models the different speech attributes appropriately, leveraging the strengths of various modeling techniques like VQGAN, global vectors, and latent code language models. The paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of this inductive bias-aware approach for zero-shot TTS.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents Mega-TTS, a large-scale text-to-speech system with proper inductive biases for different speech attributes. The main contributions are:1. The paper proposes to disentangle speech into content, timbre, prosody and phase attributes based on their intrinsic properties. Different architectures are designed to model each attribute accordingly.2. It trains a VQGAN-based acoustic model to generate mel-spectrogram and uses a prosody language model (P-LLM) to model the prosody attribute. A novel prosody-oriented decoding method is proposed for TTS inference. 3. The model is trained on 20k hours of multi-domain speech data. Experiments show it achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot TTS, speech editing and cross-lingual TTS tasks.In summary, the key contribution is introducing proper inductive biases into large-scale TTS systems by disentangling and modeling different speech attributes separately according to their intrinsic properties. This leads to superior zero-shot synthesis ability and controllability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in text-to-speech synthesis:- This paper proposes a new model architecture called Mega-TTS that uses a VQGAN-based acoustic model and a prosody language model (P-LLM) for text-to-speech. Other recent work like VALL-E, NaturalSpeech 2.0, and SPEAR-TTS also explore large language model approaches to TTS, but Mega-TTS differs in its use of the VQGAN acoustic model and discrete prosody modeling with P-LLM.- A key contribution of this paper is introducing proper inductive biases into large-scale TTS by disentangling different speech attributes like content, prosody, timbre. This is different from other works that simply encode the full speech waveform into a latent code without considering the intrinsic properties of speech components.  - Compared to previous works trained on limited data like YourTTS (1k hours), this model leverages 20k hours of multi-domain training data. The scale of data used is on par with other recent large-scale TTS models.- The paper demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot TTS and other downstream tasks like speech editing and cross-lingual TTS. The results are competitive or better than state-of-the-art models.- One limitation compared to some other works is the lack of controllable speech synthesis features like speaker and style control. The model is focused more on zero-shot generalization.Overall, this paper presents a novel TTS architecture and training approach compared to related work. The key differences are the architectural design considering speech attributes and the multi-domain 20k hour training setup. The results demonstrate Mega-TTS pushes state-of-the-art for zero-shot TTS quality.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Scaling up the training data even further to improve coverage of different voices and accents. The authors mention potentially training on 200K hours of speech data.- Improving the reconstruction robustness of the model, as it can be affected by background noise and reverberation. The authors suggest exploring new model architectures that are more robust to acoustic environment factors.- Extending the model to end-to-end speech synthesis instead of separate acoustic and vocoder models. - Exploring different conditional mechanisms besides speaker prompts to control attributes like style, emotion, age, etc.- Evaluating the model on more challenging test sets with diverse speakers and accents.- Using different segmentation mechanisms besides phonemes as the base unit of modeling, such as characters or subword units.- Incorporating external linguistic features like part-of-speech tags and syntactic structure to help model prosody.- Combining the approach with other large language models like GPT-3 for further improvements.- Developing multimodal models that can generate synchronized speech, facial expressions, and gestures.Overall, the authors point to continuing to scale up models and data, improving robustness, adding more control, and evaluating on more diverse test sets as the main directions for advancing this type of large-scale multi-modal speech synthesis system.
