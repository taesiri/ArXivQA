# [Mega-TTS: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech at Scale with Intrinsic Inductive   Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03509)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we design an effective large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) system that incorporates proper inductive biases for different aspects of speech? The key hypotheses are:1) Speech can be decomposed into several attributes like content, timbre, prosody, and phase, each with distinct properties. Modeling them separately with proper inductive biases can improve TTS performance.2) Using mel-spectrogram instead of raw waveform as the intermediate representation allows separating phase from other attributes. Phase can be reconstructed separately. 3) Timbre is a global attribute that changes slowly, so a global vector is suitable for representing it.4) Prosody has both local and long-range dependencies, making autoregressive language models ideal for modeling it.5) Content has a monotonic alignment with speech, which autoregressive models may not guarantee.So the overall goal is to design a large-scale TTS system called Mega-TTS that models the different speech attributes appropriately, leveraging the strengths of various modeling techniques like VQGAN, global vectors, and latent code language models. The paper aims to demonstrate the benefits of this inductive bias-aware approach for zero-shot TTS.
