# [Learning Generalization and Regularization of Nonhomogeneous Temporal   Poisson Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the problem of estimating nonhomogeneous Poisson processes (NHPPs) from finite and limited real-world data. NHPPs are important stochastic processes for modeling random events occurring over time, with applications such as modeling customer service calls or taxi requests. Prior works have focused on statistical estimation of NHPPs assuming infinite data. However, real applications only have finite historical data. The paper identifies two key issues with existing methods when applied to finite data:

1) Binning methods commonly used with infinite data pose a risk of overfitting with finite data. The paper proves theoretically and shows experimentally that smaller bin sizes can improve training error but hurt generalization. 

2) No existing method has systematically addressed the estimation from finite data as a learning problem with a focus on generalization to future unseen data.

Proposed Solution:
The paper formulates the NHPP estimation from finite data as a learning generalization problem. The key contributions are:

1) Proving theoretically and demonstrating experimentally that binning methods can increase overfitting probability with finite data.

2) Proposing a NHPP learning framework involving repeated iterations between data binning and rate function regression. 

3) Introducing two new adaptive binning methods based on regularization ideas from Ivanov and Tikhonov to automatically and optimally bin the finite data to improve generalization:
   - Ivanov method: Use distribution tests to assess Poisson property within bins  
   - Tikhonov method: Add regularization term based on bin lengths to control model complexity

The methods are tested on both synthetic and real-world taxi request data. Results show 10-25% RMSE improvements over common fixed equal length binning, demonstrating the effectiveness for learning generalization. Further experiments embed the learned NHPP model into a taxi scheduling application, significantly improving profit over state-of-the-art by 3-7%.
