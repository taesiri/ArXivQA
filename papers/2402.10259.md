# [GaussianObject: Just Taking Four Images to Get A High-Quality 3D Object   with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reconstructing high-quality 3D objects from extremely sparse multi-view images (e.g. only 4 images) is very challenging. This is due to two main difficulties: 1) Lack of multi-view consistency between the sparse input views makes it hard to build a reasonable 3D structure. 2) Insufficient view coverage leads to missing or compressed object information in certain views.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes GaussianObject, a framework to reconstruct 3D objects from as few as 4 images using Gaussian splatting. It has two main components:

1. Structure-prior-aided optimization: Leverages techniques like visual hull and floater elimination to inject geometric priors and establish basic multi-view consistency for a coarse 3D Gaussian representation, despite limited input data.

2. Gaussian repair model: A diffusion model-based network that takes corrupted renderings from the coarse 3D Gaussians and generates high quality repaired views. It is trained using novel self-supervised strategies like leave-one-out training and 3D noise injection. The repaired views provide additional supervision to further refine the Gaussians.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes structure-prior techniques for multi-view consistency despite only 4 input views 

- Introduces a Gaussian repair model to rectify missing or compressed object information using repaired novel views

- Achieves state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction quality from only 4 images, significantly advancing extreme sparse view 3D modeling

- Demonstrates strong performance on challenging real datasets like MipNeRF360 and OmniObject3D

In summary, GaussianObject pushes the boundary of few-view 3D reconstruction by combining geometric priors with a learning-based repair model to reconstruct high quality 3D objects from highly sparse 4 view images.
