# [Prompt Switch: Efficient CLIP Adaptation for Text-Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07648)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we effectively adapt the CLIP model for efficient text-video retrieval, where the video representations can be computed offline and reused for different text queries?The key points are:- The paper aims to learn semantically-enhanced video representations purely from the video data itself, without relying on text-conditional cross-modal fusion. This allows the video representations to be pre-computed offline.- The goal is to improve the efficiency of large-scale text-video retrieval, where the similarity computation between text and videos needs to be fast. Complex text-conditional fusion makes this computation inefficient.- The paper proposes two main ideas: (1) A "Prompt Cube" that captures global video semantics and enhances frame representations. (2) An auxiliary video captioning objective that provides fine-grained semantic guidance during training. - With these enhancements to the frame representations and a simple mean-pooling fusion, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance while being much faster for retrieval.In summary, the central hypothesis is that adapting CLIP for video via prompt engineering and captioning, without complex text-conditional fusion, can achieve both efficiency and effectiveness for large-scale text-video retrieval.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a new method to adapt CLIP to the video domain for text-video retrieval. The key ideas are:1) Introducing a "Prompt Cube" into the CLIP image encoder to capture global video semantics. The prompt cube is iteratively transposed (Prompt Switch) within the encoder to build connections between frame pairs.2) Using an auxiliary video captioning objective during training to provide fine-grained semantic guidance to the learned video representations.3) A simple mean pooling is used to aggregate the enhanced frame representations into a video representation for efficient retrieval.- It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MSR-VTT, MSVD, and LSMDC benchmarks while being significantly more efficient than previous methods. - It provides comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.In summary, the key contribution is an efficient and effective way to adapt CLIP to videos for text-video retrieval by enhancing the backbone's representation learning using prompt tuning and auxiliary objectives while keeping the retrieval process simple. The method achieves strong performance with high efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method to efficiently adapt CLIP to text-video retrieval by incorporating global video semantics into frame representations using a Prompt Cube that is iteratively transposed within the CLIP image encoder layers, and optimizing the representations with an auxiliary video captioning objective while avoiding expensive cross-modal fusion during inference.
