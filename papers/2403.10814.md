# [DarkGS: Learning Neural Illumination and 3D Gaussians Relighting for   Robotic Exploration in the Dark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10814)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper tackles the problem of building photorealistic 3D scene representations from images captured in poorly illuminated environments using a camera-light system mounted on a robot platform, where the light source moves together with the camera. Existing neural scene representation methods like NeRF fail on such illumination-inconsistent images. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a pipeline that consists of two main components:

1. NeLiS: A neural illumination and light simulator that models the camera-light system by learning the relative pose between camera and light, the RID (relative intensity distribution) and light falloff of the light source, as well as ambient light. This is done by capturing images of a calibration target and optimizing the illumination model parameters using a photometric loss between rendered and real images.  

2. DarkGS: This builds on top of NeLiS and constructs a relightable 3D Gaussian scene representation from illumination-inconsistent images through optimizing a photometric loss. It recovers metric scale and relights the scene using the learned illumination model from NeLiS.

Main Contributions:

- A pipeline to build photorealistic 3D scene representations from illumination-inconsistent images using a learned illumination model

- NeLiS - A neural illumination model and simulator that calibrates the camera-light system by learning relative pose, RID, light falloff and ambient light

- DarkGS - A 3D Gaussian scene representation method that works on images captured in dark environments and allows relighting the scene using the illumination modeled by NeLiS

- Demonstrated the pipeline on a robot platform with different light sources and scenes, showing NeLiS can adapt to different real-world light sources and DarkGS can reconstruct and relight scenes from challenging illumination-inconsistent images where other methods fail.

In summary, the key innovation is in modeling the illumination using NeLiS to enable building and relighting photorealistic scene representations from inconsistent images taken in poorly lit environments with a moving camera-light system.
