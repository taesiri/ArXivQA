# [PokeMQA: Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-hop question answering (MQA) requires reasoning over a sequence of facts to reach the final answer. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for MQA.
- However, the knowledge in LLMs can become outdated. Knowledge editing methods have been proposed to update LLMs with new facts without expensive retraining. 
- Prior knowledge editing work for MQA simply mixes question decomposition and conflict checking with edited facts into one prompt. But coupling these diverse reasoning tasks overburdens LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes PokeMQA - a lightweight model editor for knowledge editing in MQA.
- It decouples question decomposition from conflict checking with edited facts. This allows LLMs to focus on decomposition and answering.
- A programmable scope detector is introduced to detect if a question falls in the scope of any edits. If so, it retrieves the edit to guide the LLM.
- A knowledge prompt is used before decomposition to provide context about entities, improving first subquestion identification.

Main Contributions:
- PokeMQA outperforms prior state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods for MQA by a large margin across benchmarks and LLMs.
- It produces much more reliable reasoning, evaluated by a new metric - Hop-wise answering accuracy.
- Ablations validate the scope detector significantly enhances robustness to large volumes of edits and knowledge prompt improves performance.
- PokeMQA advances progress on the challenging task of knowledge editing for multi-hop question answering.

In summary, the key ideas are to decouple different reasoning tasks in knowledge editing for MQA into modular components, use programmable detectors to identify and retrieve related edits, and provide knowledge prompts for improved context. This gives large improvements in performance and reasoning reliability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes PokeMQA, a programmable knowledge editing method that decouples question decomposition and conflict detection to improve multi-hop question answering performance and address unreliable reasoning under knowledge editing scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing PokeMQA, a framework to decouple the tasks of question decomposition and knowledge editing in multi-hop question answering under knowledge editing scenarios. Specifically:

1) It proposes a programmable scope detector to offload the conflict detection in knowledge editing from the language models. This allows the language models to focus on question decomposition and answering.

2) It incorporates a knowledge prompt generator to provide additional contextual information to help with the decomposition of the first subquestion. 

3) It proposes a new evaluation metric called hop-wise answering accuracy (Hop-Acc) to measure the extent to which models follow the reasoning process step-by-step towards solving multi-hop questions.

So in summary, PokeMQA aims to improve the performance and reliability of multi-hop question answering under knowledge editing by decoupling the different reasoning tasks into separate components. The experimental results validate that this approach helps language models answer questions more precisely and interpretably.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Multi-hop question answering (MQA) - The paper focuses on methods for multi-hop question answering, which requires reasoning over a sequence of multiple facts to arrive at an answer.

- Knowledge editing - The paper examines approaches for updating language models with new factual knowledge without requiring full retraining, referred to as "knowledge editing".

- Large language models (LLMs) - The methods are evaluated using large pre-trained language models like GPT-3.5 and LLaMA as the base models.

- Programmable scope detector - A key component proposed in the paper for identifying which questions/facts are affected by a particular edit.

- Unreliable reasoning - The paper coins this term to refer to situations where models arrive at the right answer through an incorrect reasoning process. 

- Hop-wise answering accuracy - A new evaluation metric proposed to assess the correctness of the intermediate reasoning steps.

- Question decomposition - Breaking down a complex question into simpler sub-questions, a key capability needed for multi-hop QA.

- Knowledge prompt - Contextual information retrieved from a knowledge base to help with the first step of question decomposition.

- Memory-based editing - Updating an external memory of facts rather than modifying model parameters, one main approach to knowledge editing.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a programmable knowledge editing method called PokeMQA. Can you explain in detail how PokeMQA decouples the tasks of question decomposition and knowledge editing to reduce the burden on language models?

2. One key component of PokeMQA is the programmable scope detector. Can you describe its architecture, the two models it consists of, and how the two-stage editing fact retrieval process works? 

3. The paper mentions using novel metrics like Success Rate and Block Rate to evaluate and select optimal scope detector models. What are these metrics and why are they better than traditional classification metrics for this task?

4. How does the knowledge prompt generator in PokeMQA work? What is the strategy it adopts to construct meaningful and relevant prompts from the vast Wikidata knowledge base?

5. The paper argues that coupling question decomposition and knowledge editing in previous methods like MeLLo leads to unreliable reasoning. Can you analyze this limitation and explain how PokeMQA manages to produce more reliable reasoning paths? 

6. How exactly does PokeMQA address the two key challenges of knowledge editing - understanding edit semantics and parsing question structure? Elaborate on the specific techniques used.

7. The paper proposes a new evaluation metric called Hop-wise Answering Accuracy. What does this metric measure and why is it important? How is it different from existing metrics?

8. What were the main findings from the ablation studies conducted in the paper? What do they tell us about the importance of the scope detector and knowledge prompt generator components?

9. The conclusion mentions some limitations of PokeMQA like handling more complex multi-hop questions. Can you suggest some ways the method can be improved to address these?

10. The paper demonstrates PokeMQA's effectiveness on multiple language models. Do you think this framework can generalize to other types of models like retrieval augmented LMs? Why or why not?
