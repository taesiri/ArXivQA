# [PokeMQA: Programmable knowledge editing for Multi-hop Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-hop question answering (MQA) requires reasoning over a sequence of facts to reach the final answer. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for MQA.
- However, the knowledge in LLMs can become outdated. Knowledge editing methods have been proposed to update LLMs with new facts without expensive retraining. 
- Prior knowledge editing work for MQA simply mixes question decomposition and conflict checking with edited facts into one prompt. But coupling these diverse reasoning tasks overburdens LLMs.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes PokeMQA - a lightweight model editor for knowledge editing in MQA.
- It decouples question decomposition from conflict checking with edited facts. This allows LLMs to focus on decomposition and answering.
- A programmable scope detector is introduced to detect if a question falls in the scope of any edits. If so, it retrieves the edit to guide the LLM.
- A knowledge prompt is used before decomposition to provide context about entities, improving first subquestion identification.

Main Contributions:
- PokeMQA outperforms prior state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods for MQA by a large margin across benchmarks and LLMs.
- It produces much more reliable reasoning, evaluated by a new metric - Hop-wise answering accuracy.
- Ablations validate the scope detector significantly enhances robustness to large volumes of edits and knowledge prompt improves performance.
- PokeMQA advances progress on the challenging task of knowledge editing for multi-hop question answering.

In summary, the key ideas are to decouple different reasoning tasks in knowledge editing for MQA into modular components, use programmable detectors to identify and retrieve related edits, and provide knowledge prompts for improved context. This gives large improvements in performance and reasoning reliability.
