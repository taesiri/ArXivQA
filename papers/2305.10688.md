# [MolXPT: Wrapping Molecules with Text for Generative Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10688)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that pre-training a language model on text wrapped with molecular SMILES sequences can lead to improved performance on downstream tasks involving both text and molecules. Specifically, the authors propose a new model called \ourM{} that is pre-trained on a corpus containing:- Scientific text (titles and abstracts from PubMed articles)- Molecular SMILES sequences (from PubChem database)  - "Wrapped" sequences where detected molecule names in text are replaced by their corresponding SMILES.The key idea is that by training on these wrapped sequences, the model can learn the relationships between molecules and their textual descriptions. The authors then evaluate \ourM{} on two main downstream tasks:1) Molecular property prediction on MoleculeNet benchmark. Here the hypothesis is that pre-training with both text and SMILES will improve performance on predicting properties of molecules based on their structure.2) Text-molecule translation on a dataset of molecule-description pairs. The hypothesis is that the model will better capture alignment between text and molecules thanks to seeing wrapped sequences during pre-training.The overall hypothesis is that by pre-training on text "wrapped" with molecular SMILES, \ourM{} can integrate information from both modalities and achieve strong performance on downstream tasks involving molecules and text. The model architecture and training approach is designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing MolXPT, a new unified language model for molecules and text. MolXPT is pre-trained on a corpus containing scientific text, molecular SMILES strings, and "wrapped" sequences that connect text and molecules. 2. Demonstrating that pre-training on the wrapped sequences allows MolXPT to learn alignments between text and molecules. This results in improved performance on downstream tasks involving both text and molecules, such as molecular property prediction and molecule-text translation.3. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on molecular property prediction benchmarks including MoleculeNet. MolXPT outperforms previous methods including sophisticated graph neural network models.4. Obtaining comparable performance to MolT5, the previous state-of-the-art on molecule-text translation, while using less than half the number of parameters. MolXPT also shows strong zero-shot ability for text-to-molecule generation without finetuning.5. Providing a unified generative model for both text and molecules that can be finetuned via prompts for a diverse set of downstream applications at the intersection of natural language and molecular modeling.In summary, the main contribution is proposing MolXPT, a new way to jointly model text and molecules by pre-training on wrapped sequences. This allows MolXPT to achieve excellent performance on tasks involving both modalities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in molecule and text modeling:- This paper proposes MolXPT, a new pre-trained language model that jointly models text and molecules by "wrapping" SMILES sequences in text. This is a novel approach compared to prior work like MolT5 and Galactica that simply concatenate text and SMILES. By detecting molecule names and replacing them with SMILES, MolXPT can better leverage the relations between molecules and surrounding text context.- MolXPT achieves state-of-the-art results on molecular property prediction benchmarks like MoleculeNet, outperforming sophisticated graph neural network models like GEM. This demonstrates the power of pre-training on both text and SMILES for molecular modeling tasks.- On text-molecule translation tasks, MolXPT achieves comparable performance to MolT5-Large but with significantly fewer parameters (350M vs 800M). This shows the parameter efficiency and representation learning ability of MolXPT's joint pre-training approach.- MolXPT also shows promising zero-shot molecular generation ability from text without any finetuning. This is an interesting capability not demonstrated by prior work, enabled by the unified pre-training.- Compared to concurrent works like KV-PLM and MoMu that also jointly model text and molecules, MolXPT is more flexible as a generative model, while KV-PLM and MoMu are discriminative. MolXPT could be complementary to these methods.Overall, this paper presents a novel pre-training approach for unified modeling of text and molecules. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of "wrapping" SMILES in text for better representation learning. This joint modeling approach advances the state-of-the-art in tasks relying on both text and molecular information.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Train larger models to further verify the performance across different tasks and enhance the zero-shot/in-context learning ability. The authors mention they trained a relatively small model due to computational constraints, so training larger models could help demonstrate the full capabilities.- Enhance the interaction between molecules and text, such as through using contrastive learning to improve consistency between the two modalities. The paper proposes joint training on text and molecules, but further strengthening this linkage could be beneficial.- Adapt the model for additional molecule and text tasks, such as text-guided molecule optimization. The authors propose a general pre-trained model that can be finetuned for various downstream tasks, so exploring adaptation to other relevant tasks is a logical next step.- Develop methods to generate higher quality molecular structures, since validity and exact match rates for molecular generation are still relatively low based on the results. Improving synthesis ability is important for applications.- Incorporate additional molecule representations beyond SMILES strings, such as graph formulations, to provide complementary structural information.- Scale up the model size and pre-training data to further improve performance and enable training very large models as in other domains.In summary, the main future directions are developing larger variants of the model, strengthening multimodal interaction, adapting the approach to additional tasks, generating higher quality molecular structures, incorporating multiple molecular representations, and scaling up model size and data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a unified language model called \ourM{} that is pre-trained on scientific text, molecular SMILES strings, and "wrapped" sequences combining both text and SMILES. The wrapped sequences are constructed by detecting molecule mentions in text using named entity recognition, linking them to molecular databases to obtain SMILES strings, and replacing the mentions with the SMILES strings. \ourM{} is pre-trained on titles/abstracts from PubMed, SMILES strings from PubChem, and the wrapped sequences. After pre-training, \ourM{} is finetuned using prompt-based methods for downstream tasks involving molecules and text. Experiments show \ourM{} outperforms baselines on molecular property prediction and molecule-text translation tasks while using fewer parameters than prior work. The model also has zero-shot ability for text-to-molecule generation without finetuning. The results demonstrate \ourM{}'s ability to leverage relations between text and molecules through its pre-training on wrapped sequences.

MolXPT is a GPT-like transformer model that is pre-trained on titles/abstracts from PubMed, SMILES from PubChem, and the wrapped sequences. After pre-training, MolXPT can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks using prompt-based finetuning, where the inputs/outputs are formatted as text prompts. The model is evaluated on molecular property prediction using MoleculeNet and on molecule-text translation using the CheBI-20 dataset. The results show MolXPT outperforms baselines on MoleculeNet and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art on molecule-text translation while using fewer parameters. The wrapped sequences are key to allowing MolXPT to leverage relations between molecules and text.
