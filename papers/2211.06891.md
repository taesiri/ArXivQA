# [Residual Degradation Learning Unfolding Framework with Mixing Priors   across Spectral and Spatial for Compressive Spectral Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06891)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the main research focus of this paper is on recovering accurate and detailed 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) cubes from 2D coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) measurements. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new deep learning-based approach called Residual Degradation Learning Unfolding Framework (RDLUF) with Mixing priors across Spatial and Spectral (MixS2) Transformers to address two main challenges:

1) The gap between the sensing matrix and real degradation process in CASSI systems. The sensing matrix cannot properly reflect device errors caused by factors like phase aberration and distortion. 

2) The need for suitable models to exploit both spatial and spectral priors for generating high-quality HSIs. Methods relying solely on spectral attention may neglect crucial spatial information. 

To address the first challenge, the paper integrates residual learning into the data subproblem to estimate the gap between the sensing matrix and true degradation process. 

For the second challenge, it proposes a MixS2 Transformer that combines lightweight multi-scale convolutions (for spatial modeling) with spectral self-attention in a parallel design with bi-directional interaction (for complementary spectral-spatial clues).

By plugging the MixS2 Transformer into the proposed RDLUF, the model aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing accurate and detailed 3D HSIs from 2D CASSI measurements. Experiments demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared to previous approaches.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that modeling the residual degradation and effectively mixing spatial-spectral priors using the proposed techniques will improve HSI reconstruction from compressed CASSI measurements. The paper offers RDLUF-MixS2 as a solution.
