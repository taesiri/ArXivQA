# [Document Author Classification Using Parsed Language Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13253)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores using grammatical structure extracted from statistical natural language parsers to detect authorship of texts. Previous work in authorship detection has relied on statistical properties like word frequencies, but the authors propose that the parsed grammatical structure could provide more subtle signals that may be harder to spoof.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors extract several feature sets from the output of a statistical parser - all subtrees of a certain depth, rooted subtrees, part-of-speech (POS) tags, and POS tags by tree depth. They test these features on two datasets - The Federalist Papers and Jane Austen's unfinished Sanditon novel and its completion by another author. Classification is done using nearest centroid detection on the high-dimensional feature vectors, along with dimensionality reduction using SVD to avoid singular scatter matrices.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of new grammatical structure-based feature sets from statistical parsers for authorship detection, which have not been explored before.
- Testing on two benchmark dataset of papers with known disputed or imitation authorship.
- Finding that subtree-based features significantly outperform POS-based features, and work best at depths of 3-4 levels.
- Showing dimension reduction can improve classification, especially for The Federalist Papers, indicating it removes noisy directions.
- Proof of concept that subtle signals from grammar and language structure can help distinguish authorship.
- Results open up many future possibilities like adding these features to other existing feature sets for author identification.

In summary, the paper introduces parsed grammatical structures as a promising new set of hard-to-spoof features for authorship detection tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness on some benchmark dataset. It also discusses tradeoffs like volume of data needed for statistical significance.
