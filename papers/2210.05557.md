# [OPERA: Omni-Supervised Representation Learning with Hierarchical   Supervisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05557)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How to train a better model with both self-supervised and fully supervised signals?

The key points are:

- The pretrain-finetune paradigm facilitates the success of self-supervised learning (SSL), which achieves better transferability than fully supervised learning (FSL). 

- Given the availability of massive labeled data, it is worth exploring whether combining SSL signals with FSL signals can further improve transferability.

- The paper proposes Omni-suPErvised Representation leArning with hierarchical supervisions (OPERA) as a solution to effectively combine SSL and FSL.

So in summary, the main research question is how to combine self-supervised and fully supervised signals in an effective framework like OPERA to train better models that have improved transferability over models trained with only SSL or FSL alone. The paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OPERA framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new framework called OPERA for omni-supervised representation learning. The key ideas and contributions are:

- It provides a unified perspective of self-supervised learning (SSL) and fully supervised learning (FSL) under a similarity learning framework. This allows combining SSL and FSL signals in a principled way.

- It proposes to extract hierarchical proxy representations to receive SSL and FSL supervisions. Specifically, it applies SSL on the instance-level space and FSL on the class-level space. This resolves the conflicting signals between SSL and FSL. 

- It demonstrates consistently better transferability of the learned representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The method outperforms both pure SSL and FSL counterparts.

- It shows OPERA works for both convolutional networks like ResNet and vision transformers like ViT. The improvements are consistent across different network architectures.

- It reveals OPERA is efficient and achieves strong results with fewer pretraining epochs than SSL or FSL alone. This demonstrates its good data efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework OPERA to unify SSL and FSL by imposing hierarchical supervisions. This learns more transferable representations that generalize better to various downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes OPERA, a framework to combine fully supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning by extracting hierarchical proxy representations to impose corresponding supervisions, aiming to improve transferability of learned representations for computer vision models.
