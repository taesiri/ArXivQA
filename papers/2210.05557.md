# [OPERA: Omni-Supervised Representation Learning with Hierarchical   Supervisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05557)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How to train a better model with both self-supervised and fully supervised signals?

The key points are:

- The pretrain-finetune paradigm facilitates the success of self-supervised learning (SSL), which achieves better transferability than fully supervised learning (FSL). 

- Given the availability of massive labeled data, it is worth exploring whether combining SSL signals with FSL signals can further improve transferability.

- The paper proposes Omni-suPErvised Representation leArning with hierarchical supervisions (OPERA) as a solution to effectively combine SSL and FSL.

So in summary, the main research question is how to combine self-supervised and fully supervised signals in an effective framework like OPERA to train better models that have improved transferability over models trained with only SSL or FSL alone. The paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OPERA framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new framework called OPERA for omni-supervised representation learning. The key ideas and contributions are:

- It provides a unified perspective of self-supervised learning (SSL) and fully supervised learning (FSL) under a similarity learning framework. This allows combining SSL and FSL signals in a principled way.

- It proposes to extract hierarchical proxy representations to receive SSL and FSL supervisions. Specifically, it applies SSL on the instance-level space and FSL on the class-level space. This resolves the conflicting signals between SSL and FSL. 

- It demonstrates consistently better transferability of the learned representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The method outperforms both pure SSL and FSL counterparts.

- It shows OPERA works for both convolutional networks like ResNet and vision transformers like ViT. The improvements are consistent across different network architectures.

- It reveals OPERA is efficient and achieves strong results with fewer pretraining epochs than SSL or FSL alone. This demonstrates its good data efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework OPERA to unify SSL and FSL by imposing hierarchical supervisions. This learns more transferable representations that generalize better to various downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes OPERA, a framework to combine fully supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning by extracting hierarchical proxy representations to impose corresponding supervisions, aiming to improve transferability of learned representations for computer vision models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR paper compares to other research in representation learning:

- This paper proposes a new framework called OPERA that combines self-supervised and fully supervised learning in an end-to-end manner. Most prior work has focused on either self-supervised or fully supervised learning separately. A few recent papers have looked at combining them, but using a sequential approach rather than jointly training like OPERA. So this is a novel approach to omni-supervised learning.

- The key idea in OPERA is to extract hierarchical proxy representations from the image and apply self-supervision and full supervision to different levels of the hierarchy. This allows the method to balance instance-level and class-level information in an adaptive way during training. Other omni-supervised methods don't have this hierarchical mechanism.

- Extensive experiments show that OPERA outperforms both self-supervised and fully supervised baselines on image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks. This demonstrates the benefits of the joint training approach compared to just using self-supervised or supervised pretraining.

- OPERA is evaluated on both convolutional networks and vision transformers. Most prior omni-supervised learning has focused on CNNs, so the results help show the generality of the approach across model architectures.

- The comparison to masked image modeling methods like MAE is interesting. OPERA doesn't quite match their performance on ImageNet classification but gets close with fewer training epochs. This suggests the OPERA framework could be extended to incorporate masked modeling as well.

Overall, I think OPERA makes a nice contribution to the growing literature on how to effectively combine self-supervised and supervised learning. The hierarchical proxy representation approach seems to balance transferability and discrimination more optimally than prior methods. The results across tasks and architectures are quite solid.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different ways to instantiate the proposed OPERA framework, such as integrating other self-supervised signals like masked image modeling. The authors suggest this could further improve the performance of the method.

- Applying OPERA to other backbone models besides convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, to see if similar improvements can be achieved. 

- Evaluating OPERA on larger-scale pretraining datasets and on additional downstream tasks beyond those tested in the paper.

- Further analyzing the learned representations from OPERA through methods like dimensionality reduction and clustering. This could provide more insight into how OPERA balances instance-level and class-level information compared to other methods.

- Developing theoretical understandings of why and how OPERA is effective in improving transferability compared to individual fully supervised or self-supervised learning.

- Designing adaptive ways to balance the self-supervision and full supervision losses, rather than using fixed weights. This could potentially lead to better optimization and representation learning.

- Extending OPERA to semi-supervised learning settings where only a subset of the data has labels.

Overall, the authors suggest several interesting future directions to build on the OPERA framework, evaluate it in different settings, understand it better theoretically, and extend it to related representation learning paradigms like semi-supervised learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes OPERA, an Omni-supervised Representation Learning framework with hierarchical supervisions, to effectively combine fully supervised and self-supervised learning. The key idea is to extract a hierarchy of proxy representations from the image and impose self-supervision and full supervision on the corresponding levels. For an image, the instance-level proxy representation receives the self-supervised contrastive loss while the class-level proxy representation is supervised by the categorical cross-entropy loss. This allows resolving the conflicting objectives between self-supervision and full supervision. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that OPERA outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised pretraining when transferred to downstream tasks like classification, segmentation, and detection. The ablation studies demonstrate the importance of hierarchical supervisions and the ability to balance instance-level and class-level information. Overall, the paper provides a simple yet effective framework to unify self-supervised and fully supervised representation learning in a single model for better transferability.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes OPERA, a framework for omni-supervised representation learning that combines both fully supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning. The key idea is to impose hierarchical supervisions on corresponding hierarchical proxy representations extracted from the image. Specifically, an instance-level proxy representation is extracted and trained with a self-supervised contrastive loss to encourage consistency between different augmented views of the same image. Then a class-level proxy representation is extracted and trained with a fully supervised softmax loss to leverage label information. This allows combining the benefits of both self-supervised and fully supervised learning in an end-to-end framework. Extensive experiments on ImageNet pretraining demonstrate superior transfer learning performance on downstream tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection compared to using either self-supervised or fully supervised pretraining alone. The method is shown to be efficient, achieving strong performance with fewer pretraining epochs than alternatives. Ablation studies analyze the impact of different design choices like the arrangements of supervisions and demonstrate the importance of imposing the supervisions hierarchically.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) proposing a hierarchical framework to unify self-supervised and fully supervised learning objectives, (2) demonstrating strong transfer learning results by combining both supervisions efficiently in an end-to-end manner, and (3) extensive experiments and analysis demonstrating the benefits of the proposed omni-supervised learning approach. The method provides a way to effectively leverage all available supervisory signals, both labels and unlabeled data, to learn representations that transfer better to downstream tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes OPERA, an omni-supervised representation learning method with hierarchical supervisions. The key idea is to combine both fully supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning in an effective framework. The authors provide a unified perspective of the two types of supervisions within a similarity learning framework. To resolve the conflicting signals between the supervisions, the method extracts a hierarchy of proxy representations for each image to impose the corresponding supervision. Specifically, it applies self-supervision on an instance-level representation and full supervision on a separate class-level representation. This allows resolving the conflict by controlling the relative strength of the two supervisions adaptively based on the proxy representations and their transformations. Extensive experiments show that OPERA outperforms both fully supervised and self-supervised learning alone on image classification, segmentation, and detection when pretrained on ImageNet. The unified framework is shown to be more efficient and achieves better transferability.
