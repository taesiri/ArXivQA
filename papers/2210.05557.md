# [OPERA: Omni-Supervised Representation Learning with Hierarchical   Supervisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05557)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How to train a better model with both self-supervised and fully supervised signals?

The key points are:

- The pretrain-finetune paradigm facilitates the success of self-supervised learning (SSL), which achieves better transferability than fully supervised learning (FSL). 

- Given the availability of massive labeled data, it is worth exploring whether combining SSL signals with FSL signals can further improve transferability.

- The paper proposes Omni-suPErvised Representation leArning with hierarchical supervisions (OPERA) as a solution to effectively combine SSL and FSL.

So in summary, the main research question is how to combine self-supervised and fully supervised signals in an effective framework like OPERA to train better models that have improved transferability over models trained with only SSL or FSL alone. The paper aims to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed OPERA framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new framework called OPERA for omni-supervised representation learning. The key ideas and contributions are:

- It provides a unified perspective of self-supervised learning (SSL) and fully supervised learning (FSL) under a similarity learning framework. This allows combining SSL and FSL signals in a principled way.

- It proposes to extract hierarchical proxy representations to receive SSL and FSL supervisions. Specifically, it applies SSL on the instance-level space and FSL on the class-level space. This resolves the conflicting signals between SSL and FSL. 

- It demonstrates consistently better transferability of the learned representations on various downstream tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The method outperforms both pure SSL and FSL counterparts.

- It shows OPERA works for both convolutional networks like ResNet and vision transformers like ViT. The improvements are consistent across different network architectures.

- It reveals OPERA is efficient and achieves strong results with fewer pretraining epochs than SSL or FSL alone. This demonstrates its good data efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel framework OPERA to unify SSL and FSL by imposing hierarchical supervisions. This learns more transferable representations that generalize better to various downstream tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes OPERA, a framework to combine fully supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning by extracting hierarchical proxy representations to impose corresponding supervisions, aiming to improve transferability of learned representations for computer vision models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this CVPR paper compares to other research in representation learning:

- This paper proposes a new framework called OPERA that combines self-supervised and fully supervised learning in an end-to-end manner. Most prior work has focused on either self-supervised or fully supervised learning separately. A few recent papers have looked at combining them, but using a sequential approach rather than jointly training like OPERA. So this is a novel approach to omni-supervised learning.

- The key idea in OPERA is to extract hierarchical proxy representations from the image and apply self-supervision and full supervision to different levels of the hierarchy. This allows the method to balance instance-level and class-level information in an adaptive way during training. Other omni-supervised methods don't have this hierarchical mechanism.

- Extensive experiments show that OPERA outperforms both self-supervised and fully supervised baselines on image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks. This demonstrates the benefits of the joint training approach compared to just using self-supervised or supervised pretraining.

- OPERA is evaluated on both convolutional networks and vision transformers. Most prior omni-supervised learning has focused on CNNs, so the results help show the generality of the approach across model architectures.

- The comparison to masked image modeling methods like MAE is interesting. OPERA doesn't quite match their performance on ImageNet classification but gets close with fewer training epochs. This suggests the OPERA framework could be extended to incorporate masked modeling as well.

Overall, I think OPERA makes a nice contribution to the growing literature on how to effectively combine self-supervised and supervised learning. The hierarchical proxy representation approach seems to balance transferability and discrimination more optimally than prior methods. The results across tasks and architectures are quite solid.
