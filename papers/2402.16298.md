# [MV-Swin-T: Mammogram Classification with Multi-view Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in women. Early detection relies on screening mammography.
- Radiologists analyze all views in a mammogram exam together, using correlations between views to effectively detect tumors. 
- Most deep learning methods for mammogram classification have focused on single views, missing important correlations.
- Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant regions, but their use in multi-view mammogram analysis is limited.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MV-Swin-T, a novel multi-view network for mammogram classification based entirely on transformers.
- Introduces a Multi-Headed Dynamic Attention (MDA) block to enable integration of information between views at the spatial feature map level.
- MDA has fixed and shifted window configurations and cross-view attention between CC and MLO views.
- Early fusion of views after the 2nd stage retains comprehensive representation considering both views.

Main Contributions:
- First pure transformer-based multi-view network for mammogram classification.
- Novel MDA block facilitating effective fusion of multi-view information using transformer self-attention. 
- Comparative analysis of performance under different architectures and fusion strategies.
- Evaluation on public datasets CBIS-DDSM and VinDr-Mammo shows superiority over single-view methods.
- Opens possibilities for processing medical imaging exams more similar to radiologistsâ€™ analysis.

In summary, the paper presents a pioneering transformer architecture for integrating information from multiple mammogram views to improve breast cancer classification, outperforming single-view approaches. The model design and experiments provide valuable insights into effectively leveraging multi-view analysis.
