# [Ai4Fapar: How artificial intelligence can help to forecast the seasonal   earth observation signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06684)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monitoring crop conditions using Earth observation (EO) data can help ensure food security. Indicators like Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) relate to crop yield. 
- Forecasting FAPAR could improve early warning systems for detecting crop anomalies.
- Lack of research applying sequence-to-sequence deep learning models for EO time series forecasting.

Method:  
- Use Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), a sequence-to-sequence multivariate model good for time series forecasting.
- TFT uses past and future weather/climate covariates to predict future FAPAR. 
- Benchmark TFT against climatological long term average predictions.
- Use MODIS FAPAR, weather data over Europe and North Africa from 2002-2022. Regional level analysis.

Results:
- TFT predicts 1st month well (RMSE 0.02-0.04). Performance decreases for longer forecast horizons.   
- TFT outperforms benchmark for short-term forecasts up to 1 month, especially for seasonal anomalies.
- Benchmark better for long-term forecasts (>2 months).

Conclusions:
- TFT valid for short-term regional FAPAR forecasting when combined with weather data.
- Potential value incorporating TFT into early warning systems for monitoring vegetation/crops.
- Future work: use pixel-level data, test other models (CNN-based).

Main Contributions:
- Introduced and evaluated new multivariate deep learning approach (TFT model) for crop monitoring through FAPAR forecasting, helping advance early warning systems.
- Analyzed model performance over different time horizons and compared to benchmark.
- Established value of method for short-term forecasting, limitations for longer forecasts.
