# [Bayesian Online Learning for Consensus Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07679)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the problem of online classification where there is a pre-trained classifier that provides free predictions, but querying multiple human experts incurs a cost. Rather than assuming ground truth labels from an oracle, the target prediction variable is defined as the consensus (plurality vote) of the human experts. The key challenges are how to optimize predictive performance while trading off between using the free classifier predictions and selectively querying the costly human experts.

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a Bayesian framework for modeling the generative process of the classifier predictions and expert votes. This allows maintaining a posterior belief over the actual expert consensus given the currently observed votes and classifier predictions. Two methods are proposed - FinExp uses the multivariate hypergeometric distribution to exactly model drawing votes from a finite pool of experts, while InfExp considers the limiting case as the number of experts grows infinitely large. The methods also learn a prior in an online manner to capture the relative quality of the classifier predictions. A prediction is made once the estimated accuracy of predicting the consensus label reaches a threshold.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of the online consensus prediction problem and its practical relevance
- Development of a Bayesian generative modeling approach to reason about partially observed expert votes 
- Derivation of the InfExp method as a computationally simpler limiting case of FinExp
- Online learning of a prior to capture relative classifier calibration
- Systematic evaluation on two real-world crowdsourced datasets demonstrating superior efficiency over baselines

In summary, the paper makes methodological, theoretical and empirical contributions for the novel problem of optimally combining model predictions and human votes for online classification when the target isexpert consensus rather than ground truth labels. The Bayesian approach allows explicitly reasoning about uncertainty in observed votes and classifier quality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Bayesian framework for online learning to predict the consensus vote of multiple human experts by judiciously combining free predictions from a pre-trained model with costly expert votes using properties of the multivariate hypergeometric distribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors develop a general Bayesian framework for online learning of human expert consensus, based on a multivariate hypergeometric likelihood model. 

2) They identify a computationally simple limiting case of the multivariate hypergeometric approach for when the number of experts becomes infinitely large.

3) They propose a justified heuristic tied to the model's predictive beliefs on expert consensus to decide when to query experts and when to make a prediction. 

4) They systematically evaluate their proposed methods on two large, human-annotated datasets and demonstrate that their approach is significantly more efficient than competing baselines for this problem of online consensus prediction.

In summary, the key contribution is a Bayesian probabilistic framework for sequentially estimating the consensus of a group of human experts in an online setting, while intelligently trading off the cost of querying experts against improvements in accuracy. The methods are evaluated in a systematic way against baselines using two real-world crowdsourced datasets.

The paper develops a Bayesian approach to online consensus prediction, where the goal is to predict the consensus vote of a group of human experts. It proposes a multivariate hypergeometric likelihood model (\fs) and an infinite experts approximation (\is). Model predictions and expert votes are integrated to learn parameters and make decisions on when to query experts vs predict consensus. The methods are evaluated on error-cost tradeoffs and robustness to distribution shifts. The problem setup is motivated by real-world applications like crowdsourcing and citizen science where ground truth is based on human consensus rather than an oracle. The framework contributes to an emerging area of human-AI collaboration.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a Bayesian framework for online consensus prediction. How does the Bayesian approach help with accounting for uncertainty in deciding when to query experts and when to make final classification predictions?

2. The multivariate hypergeometric likelihood model is key to the proposed FinExp method. Explain in detail how this model is used and why it is a good fit for the problem. 

3. The paper identifies a computationally simpler limiting case called InfExp when the number of experts becomes very large. Explain why InfExp emerges as a limiting case and what assumptions must hold for it to be a reasonable approximation.

4. Walk through the generative process for the proposed model step-by-step, explaining each variable and distribution in detail. Discuss any assumptions you need to state. 

5. The objective function involves finding the MAP estimate of the parameters Θ. Explain what is meant by the MAP estimate and why MAP optimization was chosen over other posterior inference methods. What are the pros and cons?

6. The decision of when to stop querying experts and make a prediction is based on a threshold ξ on the predicted accuracy. Discuss the rationale behind this heuristic and how the threshold can be tuned. 

7. Distribution shift experiments show the robustness of the proposed methods. Analyze the results and discuss why FinExp and InfExp are more robust compared to the baselines.

8. The parameter τ appears to learn calibration of the pretrained model's predictions. Explain how τ captures calibration and show quantitatively that it correlates with actual model performance.

9. Discuss any limitations or assumptions of the proposed framework based on the problem setting and methodology. What enhancements or modifications could address these?

10. The paper focuses on image classification with expert votes. Discuss how you might extend the framework to other data modalities or problem settings like regression, open-set classification, etc.
