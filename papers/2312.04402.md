# [Semi-Supervised Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Unknown   Environments Using Informative Path Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04402)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised active learning approach for improving semantic segmentation performance of robots operating in unknown environments. The key idea is to leverage an adaptive informative path planner to efficiently collect training images from areas of high model uncertainty. After each mission, a sparse set of highly informative pixels is selected from the images and sent for human labeling. Additionally, highly certain pseudo-labels are automatically generated from an incrementally-built probabilistic semantic map and combined with the human labels to train the model. Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces human labeling requirements compared to fully-supervised methods, while achieving similar segmentation performance. Notably, the proposed method outperforms self-supervised approaches that rely solely on pseudo-labels, especially when limited or no in-domain labeled pre-training data is available. Key results show that by combining targeted sparse human labels and uncertainty-aware pseudo-labels, near state-of-the-art performance can be attained using only ~0.6% of labels needed by fully-supervised techniques. Overall, this semi-supervised active learning paradigm enables efficient improvement of robotic perception with minimal human supervision.
