# [A Decoding Scheme with Successive Aggregation of Multi-Level Features   for Light-Weight Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11201)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Semantic segmentation involves assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. Transformers have shown great performance on this task but directly applying them leads to high computational costs for large images. Hierarchical Vision Transformers (HVTs) have been proposed to reduce this cost by using multi-scale features and more efficient attention mechanisms. However, performance still relies heavily on how effectively the decoder module fuses these multi-scale features from the HVT encoder. Existing decoders have limitations in balancing segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes SASFormer, a new decoder architecture for semantic segmentation. It introduces two key components:

1) Aggregated Semantics Extractor (ASE): Performs successive cross-attention on downsampled multi-scale features from the HVT encoder to extract "aggregated semantics" that maintain contextual consistency for better accuracy. Using downsampled features reduces computational cost. 

2) Semantic Combining Module (SCM): Enhances the multi-scale features by combining them with the extracted aggregated semantics, which act as weights. This further improves segmentation accuracy.

Together, ASE and SCM aim to achieve higher accuracy and lower computational cost compared to prior decoders.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of SASFormer, a novel HVT-based semantic segmentation architecture with a specialized decoder (ASE + SCM) for accuracy and efficiency.
- Introduction of successive cross-attention in ASE to aggregate semantics while maintaining contextual consistency.
- Using aggregated semantics from ASE as weights in SCM to enhance multi-scale features.
- Demonstrating SASFormer's state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and computations on ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets.
- Showing the applicability of SASFormer's decoder to other HVT architectures through experiments.

In summary, this paper makes key innovations in the decoder module to improve semantic segmentation performance using HVTs in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed SASFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a lightweight transformer-based decoder architecture for semantic segmentation, called SASFormer, which achieves an improved trade-off between computational cost and accuracy through successive aggregation of multi-scale features from the encoder while maintaining contextual consistency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new decoding scheme called SASFormer for semantic segmentation based on hierarchical vision transformers. Specifically:

1) It introduces a Successive Aggregation of multi-level Features (SASFormer) decoder that aims to achieve high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational cost. This is done through two key modules:

- The Aggregated Semantics Extractor (ASE) performs successive cross-attention to extract aggregated semantics while using downsampled feature maps to reduce computation.

- The Semantic Combining Module (SCM) utilizes the aggregated semantics from ASE as weights to enhance the multi-scale features from the encoder.

2) SASFormer demonstrates an excellent balance of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods on ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets. 

3) Through extensive ablation studies, the paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed successive cross-attention in ASE and the way of combining features in SCM.

4) It also shows the applicability of SASFormer by replacing decoders in other segmentation models, improving their accuracy and reducing computation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an optimized, lightweight decoder (SASFormer) for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation based on hierarchical vision transformers.
