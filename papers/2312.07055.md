# [Communication Cost Reduction for Subgraph Counting under Local   Differential Privacy via Hash Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07055)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel mechanism called Group Randomized Response (GRR) for publishing graphs under edge local differential privacy with low communication costs. The key idea is to leverage universal hashing functions to partition the nodes and edges into uniform groups, randomly sample a representative from each group, and only share the edges of those representatives after applying randomized response. This sampling allows amplifying the privacy budget to reduce bit-flips during randomized response, cutting communication by a factor of $s^2$ where $s$ is the sampling rate. The authors apply GRR to triangle counting, further reducing variance via central server sampling. Experimental results on Wikipedia networks show GRR with central server sampling and smooth sensitivity achieves over 1000x lower error than state-of-the-art methods for low communication budgets, consistently outperforming across graph sizes and privacy budgets. The method provides unbiased graph statistics with tunable communication-accuracy tradeoff. Key contributions are formal privacy and accuracy analyses of GRR, proposing central server sampling and smooth sensitivity for triangle counting, and extensive experiments demonstrating substantial improvements.
