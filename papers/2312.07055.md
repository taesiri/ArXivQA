# [Communication Cost Reduction for Subgraph Counting under Local   Differential Privacy via Hash Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07055)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel mechanism called Group Randomized Response (GRR) for publishing graphs under edge local differential privacy with low communication costs. The key idea is to leverage universal hashing functions to partition the nodes and edges into uniform groups, randomly sample a representative from each group, and only share the edges of those representatives after applying randomized response. This sampling allows amplifying the privacy budget to reduce bit-flips during randomized response, cutting communication by a factor of $s^2$ where $s$ is the sampling rate. The authors apply GRR to triangle counting, further reducing variance via central server sampling. Experimental results on Wikipedia networks show GRR with central server sampling and smooth sensitivity achieves over 1000x lower error than state-of-the-art methods for low communication budgets, consistently outperforming across graph sizes and privacy budgets. The method provides unbiased graph statistics with tunable communication-accuracy tradeoff. Key contributions are formal privacy and accuracy analyses of GRR, proposing central server sampling and smooth sensitivity for triangle counting, and extensive experiments demonstrating substantial improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using linear congruence hashing to group edges for efficient sampling, allowing accurate subgraph counting under local differential privacy with substantially reduced communication costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new mechanism called the Group Randomized Response (GRR) for publishing graphs under edge local differential privacy with low communication costs. Specifically:

1) The GRR mechanism utilizes linear congruence hash functions to partition the nodes and edges into groups. Only a randomly sampled representative edge from each group is shared with the aggregator after applying randomized response. This allows reducing communication costs by a factor of O(s^2), where s is the sampling rate.

2) The mechanism is applied to the problem of counting triangles under edge local differential privacy. When combined with a technique called central server sampling, the GRR mechanism can reduce the variance and further lower communication costs compared to prior art. 

3) Experimental results on real-world graphs show that the GRR mechanism can reduce the relative error of triangle counting by up to 1000 times compared to previous algorithms for the same communication budget.

In summary, the key innovation is the use of hashing and sampling to develop a communication-efficient mechanism for publishing graphs privately, with applications to problems like subgraph counting.

The paper introduces a "group randomized response" (GRR) mechanism to reduce the communication cost of publishing graphs under edge local differential privacy. Key ideas include using linear congruence hashing to group nodes/edges, sampling representative edges from each group, applying randomized response at a higher privacy budget due to amplification, and using techniques like central server sampling and smooth sensitivity to reduce variance when counting triangles. Experiments show the GRR mechanism can substantially reduce error compared to previous methods when matched for communication cost.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the use of linear congruence hashing for sampling help reduce communication costs in the proposed method? Explain the intuition behind why it is effective.

2. The paper claims that the proposed method can reduce communication costs by a factor of $s^2$ where $s$ is the sampling rate. Walk through the theoretical analysis and calculations that lead to this result. 

3. Explain how the smooth sensitivity mechanism is adapted and applied for triangle counting in the proposed method. What are the benefits of using smooth sensitivity over just adding Laplacian noise based on global sensitivity?

4. The central server sampling technique is shown to further reduce variance in triangle counting estimates. Explain the intuition behind why server-side sampling helps reduce covariance terms.

5. Compare and contrast the scaling of variance terms (e.g. $S_2$, $C_4$) with sampling rate between the proposed method and the ARR algorithm from previous work. Why does the proposed method scale more favorably?

6. Walk through the theoretical analysis of proving unbiasedness of the triangle counting estimator. What is the intuition behind the definitions of the $\omega$ and $\tilde{\sigma}$ terms? 

7. Explain why deterministic selection of the $S_1,...S_m$ groups would lead to high variance in the estimates. Why is the randomization with linear congruence hashing important?

8. The degree sharing step publishes noisy degree information using the Laplacian mechanism. Explain whether and how any information from this step could be used to compromise privacy later.

9. Discuss the limitations and potential failure cases of the proposed method. For what types of graphs or subgraph counting tasks might it not work as well?

10. Suggest some promising directions for future work building upon the ideas introduced in this paper. What are some open challenges left to address?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing algorithms for publishing graph statistics under edge local differential privacy, such as counts of subgraphs like triangles, suffer from high communication costs. This makes them inefficient for large real-world graphs with millions of nodes. The two-step mechanism requires each user to download the entire distorted graph of size O(n^2) bits. Other techniques like randomized response also lead to O(n^2) communication cost. This huge cost is infeasible in practice.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel four-step mechanism called Group Randomized Response (GRR) to reduce the communication cost:

1. Degree Sharing Step: Each user shares their degree using Laplacian noise for bias correction later. 

2. Grouping Step: Users are partitioned into groups of size s using linear congruence hash functions. This grouping can be efficiently shared.

3. Randomized Response Step: Only one random representative edge from each group is shared by users after randomized response. This leads to a sampled graph. 

4. Counting Step: Statistics like triangle counts are computed locally using the shared group samples and then aggregated.

By sampling edges at a rate s, the probability of bit flips reduces by s and hence the communication cost reduces by s^2. The grouping via hash functions allows easy sharing and reproduction of the sampling by all users.


Main Contributions:

1. Proposes a novel 4-step GRR mechanism to reduce communication cost for publishing graph statistics under edge local differential privacy using edge grouping and sampling.

2. Introduces linear congruence hashing for easy reproducibility of sampling across users to enable distributed computation.

3. Shows both theoretically and empirically that GRR reduces communication cost by a factor of s^2 while only increasing the variance by a factor of s.

4. For a fixed communication budget, GRR reduces the L2 error of triangle counting on real graphs by up to 1000 times compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in developing a practical edge local differential privacy mechanism for graphs that provides very accurate statistics with low communication overhead.
