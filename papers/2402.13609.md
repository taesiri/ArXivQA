# [VOOM: Robust Visual Object Odometry and Mapping using Hierarchical   Landmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional visual SLAM systems using only map points as landmarks lack high-level semantic information and have limited robustness. 
- Existing object-SLAM methods that utilize cuboids or ellipsoids have tried to incorporate object residuals into optimization but achieve little/no improvement over feature-based methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes VOOM, a novel visual object odometry and mapping framework that uses both low-level map points and high-level objects as hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine manner.

- In odometry, associated objects are used to enhance data association of map points, allowing more matches between current frame and previous map points. This gives better frame pose estimation.

- In mapping, an object-based covisibility graph is built to capture relationships between keyframes and objects. Local bundle adjustment is done on retrieved keyframes and map points to refine poses and positions.  

Main Contributions:
- Development of VOOM framework that seamlessly integrates both feature points and objects into all stages of visual SLAM pipeline.

- Design of effective algorithms for object optimization, association and map point association using object information. This allows constructing enhanced maps.

- Extensive experiments showing VOOM matches or exceeds state-of-the-art visual SLAM methods like ORB-SLAM2 in localization accuracy. To the best of knowledge, first demonstration of object-SLAM system surpassing feature-based systems.

In summary, the key novelty is using hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine approach to exploit semantic object information to improve efficiency and accuracy of feature-based SLAM.
