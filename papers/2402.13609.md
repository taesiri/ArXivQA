# [VOOM: Robust Visual Object Odometry and Mapping using Hierarchical   Landmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13609)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional visual SLAM systems using only map points as landmarks lack high-level semantic information and have limited robustness. 
- Existing object-SLAM methods that utilize cuboids or ellipsoids have tried to incorporate object residuals into optimization but achieve little/no improvement over feature-based methods.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes VOOM, a novel visual object odometry and mapping framework that uses both low-level map points and high-level objects as hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine manner.

- In odometry, associated objects are used to enhance data association of map points, allowing more matches between current frame and previous map points. This gives better frame pose estimation.

- In mapping, an object-based covisibility graph is built to capture relationships between keyframes and objects. Local bundle adjustment is done on retrieved keyframes and map points to refine poses and positions.  

Main Contributions:
- Development of VOOM framework that seamlessly integrates both feature points and objects into all stages of visual SLAM pipeline.

- Design of effective algorithms for object optimization, association and map point association using object information. This allows constructing enhanced maps.

- Extensive experiments showing VOOM matches or exceeds state-of-the-art visual SLAM methods like ORB-SLAM2 in localization accuracy. To the best of knowledge, first demonstration of object-SLAM system surpassing feature-based systems.

In summary, the key novelty is using hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine approach to exploit semantic object information to improve efficiency and accuracy of feature-based SLAM.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a visual odometry and mapping framework called VOOM that uses both low-level feature points and high-level objects as hierarchical landmarks in a coarse-to-fine manner to achieve better localization accuracy than state-of-the-art feature-based visual SLAM systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The development of a novel visual object odometry and mapping (VOOM) framework using both feature points and dual quadrics as hierarchical landmarks. 

2) The design of effective algorithms for object optimization, object association, and objects-based map points association to construct a map with hierarchical landmarks.

3) Extensive experimental validation demonstrating the superiority of VOOM compared to state-of-the-art methods like ORB-SLAM2. The experiments show that VOOM with only odometry and mapping components can even outperform ORB-SLAM2 with loop closure on localization accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and experimentally validating a method that achieves better visual SLAM performance by utilizing both robust object-level information and accurate feature-based map points in an integrated framework. This is the first work to show an object-oriented SLAM system surpassing state-of-the-art feature-based methods.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Visual object odometry and mapping (VOOM)

The paper proposes a novel visual SLAM framework called VOOM that utilizes both low-level feature points and high-level objects as landmarks in a hierarchical manner. Key aspects include the object observation model, data association, integration of objects to enhance feature matching and pose optimization, constructing an object-based covisibility graph, and optimizing based on objects and points. The goal is to exploit object information to improve visual odometry and mapping over state-of-the-art feature-based methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a visual object odometry and mapping (VOOM) framework that utilizes both feature points and objects as landmarks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a hierarchical landmark representation compared to using only points or only objects?

2. The observation model for objects is based on the 2nd order Wasserstein distance between extracted image ellipses and projected ellipsoids. Why was the Wasserstein distance chosen over other metrics? How does it compare to using bounding box IoU for data association?

3. The paper claims the proposed framework is the first to show that an object-oriented SLAM system using dual quadrics can outperform state-of-the-art feature-based methods. What enables this performance improvement compared to prior object-based methods?  

4. Explain in detail the two-stage coarse-to-fine process used in the visual object odometry backend. Why is it beneficial to use associated objects to refine the map points matching and pose optimization?

5. The visual object mapping thread constructs an object-based covisibility graph. How does this differ from a traditional point-based covisibility graph? What are the advantages of using the object graph to select keyframes for local bundle adjustment?

6. In the ablation study, using objects in mapping contributes slightly more to accuracy than using them in odometry. Why might this be the case? How do the proposed observation model and data association method positively impact results?

7. The paper shows improved performance even without loop closure. What aspects of the method enable it to implicitly close loops and reduce drift? Could this approach fully replace explicit loop closure detection?

8. How might the proposed framework handle dynamic environments and objects? Would any modifications need to be made?

9. What ideas from this paper could be applied to improve the performance of other SLAM systems like LSD-SLAM or Direct Sparse Odometry? What components are reasonably compatible?

10. The method relies on instance segmentation results from an external network. How sensitive is performance to the quality of segmentation? What innovations in perception could further improve VOOM?
