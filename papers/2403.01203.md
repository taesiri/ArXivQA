# [Pseudo-Label Calibration Semi-supervised Multi-Modal Entity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01203)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Pseudo-Label Calibration Semi-supervised Multi-Modal Entity Alignment":

Problem:
- Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to match entities referring to the same real-world concept across different multi-modal knowledge graphs. 
- Prior arts have limitations: 1) Direct interaction and fusion of multi-modal information introduces modality-specific noise; 2) Do not fully explore optimal embedding methods for each modality; 3) Overlook training strategy with limited labeled data.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Pseudo-label Calibration Multi-modal Entity Alignment (PCMEA) framework with 3 main components:

1. Attention-guided Multi-modal Embedding:
   - Employ diverse encoders (GAT, BERT, etc.) and attention mechanisms to extract features from structure, relations, attributes and images.
   - Weighted concatenation to form joint embedding.

2. Mutual Information Enhanced Cross-modality Alignment:
   - Align uni-modal embeddings with joint embedding using alignment loss to enable knowledge transfer.
   - Employ mutual information maximization to filter modality-specific noise and retain modal-invariant commonality.
   
3. Contrastive Learning with Pseudo-Label Calibration:
   - Pseudo-label calibration via modal ensemble to improve quality of pseudo-labels.
   - Momentum-based contrastive learning to pull aligned entities closer.
   
Main Contributions:
- Propose mutual information enhanced cross-modality alignment to reduce modality-specific noise and enable complementary knowledge transfer.
- Design pseudo-label calibration strategy to improve quality of pseudo-labels for semi-supervised learning.
- Introduce momentum-based contrastive learning approach tailored for entity alignment.
- Achieve new state-of-the-art performance on two MMEA datasets, significantly outperforming prior arts.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a semi-supervised pseudo-label calibration multi-modal entity alignment framework called PCMEA. This framework utilizes various embedding methods and attention mechanisms to obtain multi-modal entity representations.

2) It applies mutual information maximization to filter out task-independent noise and transfer cross-modality information, instead of direct interaction and fusion of multi-modal embeddings. 

3) It combines pseudo-label calibration with momentum-based contrastive learning to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and contrastive learning. This helps pull aligned entity pairs closer and improves alignment performance.

4) Experimental results demonstrate that PCMEA consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, producing high-quality alignment performance even under 20% labeled data settings.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing the PCMEA framework for semi-supervised multi-modal entity alignment, using mutual information maximization and contrastive learning with pseudo-label calibration to effectively leverage both labeled and unlabeled data.
