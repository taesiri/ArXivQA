# [Implications of the AI Act for Non-Discrimination Law and Algorithmic   Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20089)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Non-discrimination law faces difficulties enforcing principles of equality and non-discrimination against algorithmic discrimination in AI systems. Issues include proofing discrimination, restricted model access, and a focus on individual cases rather than system-wide fairness.
- Technical approaches to algorithmic fairness also have limitations in formalizing ethical concepts and lack enforcement mechanisms. 

Proposed Solution:
- The EU's AI Act bridges non-discrimination law and algorithmic fairness by prospectively shifting non-discrimination responsibilities to the model development stage for high-risk AI systems.
- It requires bias detection, correction and appropriate data governance to prevent discrimination prohibited under EU law. 
- Legal guidance is needed on implementing substantive non-discrimination standards into technical requirements. The AI Act also enables processing sensitive attributes for bias detection and correction under data protection law.

Main Contributions:
- Outlines enforcement problems facing both non-discrimination law and algorithmic fairness approaches when addressing unfairness in AI systems
- Discusses how the EU AI Act links non-discrimination law and technical fairness to enable discrimination prevention "by design" 
- Comments on key practical challenges for compliance around defining appropriate fairness metrics and evidence needed for sufficient bias detection and correction
- Calls for pioneering interdisciplinary work specifying legal non-discrimination requirements for algorithmic fairness and AI system development

In summary, the paper argues the EU AI Act could promote convergence of legal and technical perspectives on discrimination/fairness in AI systems. Challenges remain in translating legal concepts into technical requirements and enforcement. Overall it highlights this intersection as an important area for future research.
