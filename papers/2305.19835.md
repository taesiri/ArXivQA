# [Deliberate then Generate: Enhanced Prompting Framework for Text   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19835)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the text, it seems the main research question/hypothesis relates to investigating whether and how deliberation ability can emerge in large language models (LLMs) by asking them to rethink and learn to detect potential errors in their output. Specifically, the paper proposes a new prompting framework called "Deliberate then Generate" (DTG) that contains instructions and candidate outputs to enable an error detection process before final text generation. The key hypothesis is that this deliberation process through error detection instructions and irrelevant candidate text will enable LLMs to deliberate and avoid potential errors, improving their generative abilities across different text generation tasks. The experiments aim to test if DTG prompting can consistently improve model performance compared to conventional prompting methods that provide only correct information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel prompting framework called "Deliberate then Generate" (DTG) for large language models (LLMs). DTG encourages LLMs to deliberate and detect potential errors in a synthesized candidate text before generating the final output.

2. Showing that DTG can be easily applied to various text generation tasks with minimal prompt modifications, making it a simple yet effective and general approach. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on over 20 datasets across 7 text generation tasks. The results demonstrate that DTG consistently improves performance over standard prompting baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

4. Providing in-depth analysis on the efficacy of DTG, including ablation studies, error analysis, human evaluation, and case studies. The analyses reveal that DTG successfully triggers the deliberation ability in LLMs and helps avoid potential errors.

5. Benchmarking the performance of powerful LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on multiple text generation tasks. The results help deepen our understanding of state-of-the-art LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the DTG prompting framework that can enhance LLMs' performance across diverse text generation tasks through a simple prompting approach that facilitates deliberation and error detection. The extensive experiments and analyses further demonstrate and explain the effectiveness of DTG.

- Investigating whether the improvements from DTG prompting transfer to other modalities like image generation.

- Analyzing the internal representations and processing of LLMs when exposed to the DTG prompting framework, to better understand the mechanisms behind its effectiveness.

- Considering how other techniques like human feedback and reinforcement learning could complement DTG prompting.

- Mitigating potential biases inherited from the pretrained models when applying DTG prompting.

In summary, the authors point to several promising directions for improving prompting techniques to unlock deliberative abilities in LLMs, evaluating DTG across modalities and models, and analyzing the reasons behind its effectiveness. Expanding the tasks, datasets, and models assessed could further demonstrate the versatility of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new prompting framework called Deliberate then Generate (DTG) to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on text generation tasks. DTG prompts encourage the LLM to detect potential errors in a candidate output before generating the final result. Specifically, the prompt provides task instructions, an irrelevant candidate text like a random sentence or empty string, and asks the model to identify errors and refine the candidate. 

Experiments on over 20 datasets across 7 text generation tasks like summarization, translation, and dialogue show DTG consistently improves over standard prompting. DTG achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks and works well even with strong candidate texts from other systems. Analyses reveal DTG reduces certain error types and benefits from dissimilar candidates. The simplicity and generality of DTG makes it widely applicable for enhancing LLMs without extensive tuning. Overall, the results demonstrate DTG is an effective prompting technique to improve deliberation and avoid errors in LLMs for text generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new prompting framework called Deliberate then Generate (DTG) for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on text generation tasks. DTG consists of providing the LLM with instructions to detect errors in a candidate output, followed by generating an improved output after deliberation. Specifically, DTG prompts contain a task description, a candidate output which is an irrelevant or empty string, and instructions asking the LLM to detect any errors in the candidate output first before providing the final refined output. By deliberating on and correcting the irrelevant candidate text, DTG is able to improve the coherence, fluency and accuracy of the LLM's generated text across a range of generation tasks like summarization, translation, dialogue, and simplification. DTG requires minimal modification to apply across tasks and consistently outperforms standard prompting baselines. Analyses reveal DTG enables error avoidance and deliberative abilities in LLMs.

 Based on the abstract and introduction, the key points of the paper seem to be:

- The paper proposes a new prompting framework called "Deliberate then Generate" (DTG) for guiding large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on text generation tasks. 

- The DTG prompting encourages LLMs to deliberate and detect potential errors in a candidate text before generating the final output. This is inspired by how humans learn from both positive and negative feedback.

- DTG uses irrelevant or empty candidate text to stimulate the model's deliberation abilities, rather than providing a high-quality baseline text.

- The method requires minimal customization for different text generation tasks.

- Experiments on over 20 datasets across 7 text generation tasks (machine translation, summarization, dialogue, simplification, style transfer, paraphrase, commonsense generation) show DTG consistently improves results over standard prompting baselines.

- Analyses reveal DTG enables error detection and avoidance abilities in LLMs. DTG establishes new state-of-the-art results on some tasks.

In summary, the key focus is proposing and analyzing a simple yet effective prompting framework called DTG to enhance LLMs' performance on diverse text generation tasks by facilitating error deliberation before output generation.

 Based on my understanding of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in the same field:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel prompting framework called "Deliberate then Generate" (DTG) that encourages large language models (LLMs) to deliberate and avoid potential errors before generating text. This is different from most existing prompting methods that only provide the model with correct information. 

- The key idea of DTG is to include instructions for the model to first detect errors in a candidate text, which may intentionally contain errors, and then generate an improved output. This promotes the model's deliberation abilities in a way that has not been explored in prior prompting research.

- The paper conducts extensive experiments on over 20 datasets across 7 text generation tasks to demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of DTG prompting. Most prior work on prompting focuses on just 1-2 tasks.

- Results show DTG prompting consistently improves performance over standard prompting baselines and achieves state-of-the-art on multiple datasets. This demonstrates the impact of incorporating deliberation into prompting.

- In-depth analysis provides insights into how DTG enables error avoidance and deliberation in LLMs. Most prompting papers lack this level of analysis into the underlying mechanisms.

- Overall, the DTG framework seems quite novel compared to prior prompting work that only provides the model with correct examples. The analysis into its mechanisms also goes deeper than most similar studies. The broad experiments demonstrate wide applicability across generation tasks.
