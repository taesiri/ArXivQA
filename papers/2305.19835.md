# [Deliberate then Generate: Enhanced Prompting Framework for Text   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19835)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review of the paper, it seems the central research question is:How can we enhance and improve prompting frameworks for large language models to enable more accurate and fluent text generation across diverse tasks?In particular, the paper proposes a new prompting framework called "Deliberate then Generate" (DTG) that aims to improve text generation by first having the language model detect potential errors in a candidate text before generating the final output. The key hypotheses tested in the paper are:1) By instructing language models to deliberately detect errors in a candidate text before generating, it will enable more accurate and higher quality text generation compared to standard prompting methods. 2) The DTG prompting framework is generalizable and can be easily adapted to improve performance across a diverse range of text generation tasks with minimal modification.3) Providing the language model with an irrelevant or empty candidate text as input is an effective way to trigger error detection and deliberation, compared to using a high quality baseline text.4) The deliberation process enabled by DTG prompting reduces certain common error types in generated text such as under-translation and incorrect entity translation.The paper tests these hypotheses through extensive experiments on over 20 datasets spanning 7 different text generation tasks. The consistent improvements in performance across tasks compared to baseline prompting provides evidence supporting the core hypotheses that DTG prompting enables improved text generation through facilitated deliberation and error detection.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the key research question it investigates is:How can prompting methods be enhanced for large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance on a wide range of text generation tasks?The paper proposes a new prompting framework called "Deliberate then Generate" (DTG) that aims to trigger deliberation and error avoidance abilities in LLMs before final text generation. The key hypothesis is that by instructing the model to first detect potential errors in a candidate text and then generate an improved version, the overall quality of the model's text generation can be improved across different tasks. The DTG prompting consists of providing the LLM with:1) An instruction describing the desired text generation task 2) A synthesized text as a candidate output that may contain errors3) A prompt to detect errors in the candidate and generate an improved textThe paper tests whether this prompting approach consistently helps LLMs like GPT-3 avoid errors and generate better text compared to standard prompting methods, across tasks like summarization, translation, dialogue, etc. The central hypothesis is that the extra deliberation step enables models to generate higher quality text.In summary, the key research question is whether prompting LLMs to deliberately detect potential errors before final generation can enhance performance across diverse text generation tasks. The paper aims to test their proposed DTG prompting framework as a way to trigger more deliberative behavior.
