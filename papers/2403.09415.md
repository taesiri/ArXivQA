# [User Identification via Free Roaming Eye Tracking Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09415)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior research on user identification via eye movements has been restricted to laboratory settings with controlled stimuli. This may not reflect natural human behavior. 
- There is a need to study user identification in real-world dynamic settings using affordable eye trackers.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors collect a new dataset comprising "free roaming" (walk around a university campus) and "targeted roaming" (find a specific room in a library) scenarios using a low-cost 200Hz Pupil Labs eye tracker. 
- 41 participants complete both sessions on the same day. Eye movement data is recorded.
- Fixations and saccades are detected using the Identification by Velocity Threshold algorithm. Features based on position, velocity and higher order derivatives are extracted.
- A Radial Basis Function Network classifier is trained on session 1 data and tested on session 2 data to identify users.

Main Contributions:
- First study of user identification from eye movements in non-laboratory real-world settings.
- Achieve accuracy of 89.4% for targeted roaming and 87.3% for free roaming, comparable to 95.3% for a laboratory dataset. 
- Find 140s targeted roaming fragments from the end give best accuracy. Duration is the top feature for differentiating users.
- Show promising user identification is possible with low-cost eye trackers in real-world conditions.

In summary, this is the first user identification study using mobile eye tracking in uncontrolled real-world conditions. The high accuracy demonstrates the feasibility despite limitations of budget equipment and environment. Key findings on trajectory lengths and discriminative features advance our understanding.
