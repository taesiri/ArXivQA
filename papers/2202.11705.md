# [COLD Decoding: Energy-based Constrained Text Generation with Langevin   Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11705)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to incorporate constraints into text generation using pretrained language models, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. The main hypothesis appears to be that constrained text generation can be formulated as sampling from an energy-based model through the use of a flexible energy function and efficient Langevin dynamics sampling. The proposed approach, called COLD (Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics), aims to enable controllable and coherent text generation by specifying constraints via an energy function and then sampling from the induced distribution using gradient-based reasoning. 

The key ideas seem to be:

- Formulating constrained text generation in an energy-based modeling framework to flexibly incorporate different constraints into a unified energy function.

- Using continuous approximations and Langevin dynamics for efficient differentiable sampling from the complex energy landscape, overcoming challenges with discrete text.

- Applying COLD to pretrained language models without task-specific fine-tuning to steer generation based on constraints.

- Demonstrating COLD's flexibility and effectiveness on challenging text generation tasks like lexically-constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning by specifying appropriate energy functions.

So in summary, the main research question appears to be focused on exploring constrained decoding without fine-tuning by formulating it as energy-based sampling, in order to provide control over text generation from pretrained LMs. The key hypothesis seems to be that the proposed COLD approach can effectively handle diverse constraints and generate high quality outputs for varying tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The proposal of a new constrained decoding approach called COLD (Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics) that formulates decoding as sampling from an energy-based model (EBM). COLD allows flexibly composing constraints based on the task using an energy function, then performs sampling via Langevin dynamics.

2. COLD provides a unified framework for incorporating hard lexical constraints and soft contextual constraints. It complements prior decoding methods that search for an optimal solution, by providing a sampling approach instead. 

3. An empirical evaluation of COLD on three challenging text generation tasks: lexically constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning. The results provide insights into the strengths of COLD compared to prior approaches involving discrete search or differentiable reasoning.

4. The introduction of Langevin dynamics to text-based EBMs for efficient gradient-based sampling, by using a continuous relaxation of text. This helps address longstanding challenges with sampling from EBMs over discrete text.

5. Demonstrating that COLD can be applied directly to off-the-shelf language models without task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its flexibility.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposal and empirical evaluation of the COLD framework for flexible constrained text generation using efficient sampling with Langevin dynamics. The results on three tasks highlight its strengths over prior decoding methods involving search or optimization.

The paper proposes a new decoding approach called COLD that treats text generation as sampling from an energy-based model defined over continuous token vectors, allowing the incorporation of diverse lexical, semantic, and fluency constraints through an energy function, with efficient sampling via Langevin dynamics; COLD is applied to three challenging text generation tasks - lexically-constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning - outperforming prior decoding methods designed specifically for those tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for constrained text generation using energy-based models and Langevin dynamics. Here is a high-level comparison to other related work in this field:

- Most prior work has focused on training constrained text generation models that incorporate constraints, often requiring task-specific training data. This paper proposes a new constrained decoding approach that works with off-the-shelf language models without any fine-tuning.

- Several papers have proposed specialized discrete search algorithms like beam search variants for constrained decoding. This paper introduces a gradient-based sampling approach using continuous relaxation and Langevin dynamics, which provides more flexibility in constraint composition.

- Some recent papers have also explored continuous relaxation and gradient-based decoding. However, they use more complex interleaved forward/backward passes rather than proposing a unified energy-based formulation like this paper. 

- This paper offers a principled energy-based perspective for constrained decoding by composing task-specific constraints into an energy function. The use of Langevin dynamics for text is also novel.

- The paper provides empirical comparisons to specialized baselines on three challenging text generation tasks. The proposed approach is shown to be comparable or often better, while being more general.

In summary, this paper makes contributions in formulating constrained decoding in a unified energy-based framework amenable to efficient Langevin sampling. The experiments demonstrate the flexibility and strong performance of the approach compared to both specialized algorithms and other gradient-based decoding methods. The proposed energy-based sampling perspective is a unique way to tackle these problems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more efficient and scalable algorithms for energy-based constrained text generation. The authors note that their current approach can be slow due to the gradient computations required for Langevin dynamics sampling. Finding ways to make these computations faster and more scalable would allow the approach to be applied to even larger language models.

- Exploring different constraints and energy functions for new applications. The flexible energy-based formulation allows for incorporating many types of constraints. The authors suggest exploring new constraints and energy functions tailored for other challenging text generation applications beyond what was demonstrated in the paper.

- Combining the approach with other decoding methods. The energy-based sampling method could potentially be combined with beam search or other discrete search methods. Exploring hybrid methods could yield further improvements.

- Training an end-to-end model. While the current work focuses on constrained decoding, the authors suggest investigating end-to-end training of models that can perform constrained generation without the need for specialized decoding procedures.

- Studying societies of models. With the ability to generate multiple samples, the authors suggest exploring using a collection or "society" of models together, rather than a single model.

- Theoretical analysis. More theoretical analysis could provide better understanding of the trade-offs with different energy functions and the convergence behavior of Langevin dynamics for text.

In summary, the main future directions focus on improving the efficiency and scalability of the approach, applying it to new tasks and domains, combining it with other methods, end-to-end training, using collections of models, and theoretical analysis. Overall, there seem to be many interesting open research questions to explore in advancing energy-based constrained text generation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new decoding approach called Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD) for constrained text generation. The key idea is to formulate decoding as sampling from an energy-based model (EBM) by specifying constraints through an energy function, then performing efficient sampling using Langevin dynamics. COLD provides a flexible framework to incorporate lexical, semantic, and fluency constraints for tasks like lexically-constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning. It works by defining the EBM over a continuous relaxation of text using "soft" token representations, allowing gradient-based Langevin sampling. The resulting soft sequences are discretized to fluent text using top-k filtering with an LM. Experiments across the three tasks demonstrate COLD's effectiveness over prior specialized decoding methods, achieving strong performance on automatic metrics and human evaluation. The framework supports composing arbitrary differentiable constraints, sampling full sequences in parallel, and balancing constraints as energy terms. Overall, COLD offers a way to perform constrained text generation by simply plugging in suitable constraints into an energy function.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for constrained text generation called Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD). The key idea is to formulate decoding as sampling from an energy-based model (EBM) that incorporates constraints as differentiable functions in the energy. Sampling is done using Langevin dynamics, an efficient gradient-based MCMC method. This allows flexibly plugging in constraints like fluency, similarity to a reference, or inclusion of keywords. 

The authors demonstrate COLD on three tasks: lexically-constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning. For each task, they compose an energy function using relevant constraints. Experiments compare COLD against prior decoding methods like NeuroLogic and Delorean. Results show COLD achieves higher lexical constraint coverage than NeuroLogic on the first task, while generating more coherent text than Delorean on the reasoning tasks. The unified framework supports all three tasks through constraint composition. The paper provides a new way to perform constrained decoding with pretrained language models, without task-specific fine-tuning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new constrained text decoding approach called COLD (Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics) that treats text generation as sampling from an energy-based model. The key idea is to specify an energy function by plugging in differentiable constraint functions suitable for the task, then perform efficient sampling from the induced distribution using Langevin dynamics. Specifically, COLD operates on a continuous relaxation of text called a soft sequence, where each position is a vector corresponding to logits over the vocabulary. Sampling is done by iteratively updating the soft sequence using gradients of the energy function. This allows incorporating constraints like fluency, keyword inclusion, and contextual coherence. The resulting continuous sample is mapped back into discrete fluent text using a technique called top-k filtering, where the most likely token from the top-k probabilities of an autoregressive LM is selected. Experiments on tasks like lexical constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual generation demonstrate COLD's flexibility and strong performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Energy-based Constrained Text Generation with Langevin Dynamics" addresses the problem of incorporating different constraints into text generation to control the semantics or style of the generated text. These constraints can be hard (like ensuring certain keywords are included) or soft (like contextualizing the output with left/right context). 

The authors propose a new constrained decoding approach called COLD (Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics) that treats text generation as sampling from an energy-based model. The key ideas are:

- Formulating constrained generation as specifying an energy function with constraint components, then sampling from the induced distribution using Langevin dynamics.

- Using continuous relaxation of text tokens and differentiable constraints to enable gradient-based sampling with Langevin dynamics.

- Mapping the continuous samples back to discrete text sequences in a fluent way using top-k filtering.

The goal is to enable flexible constrained text generation that can work directly with pretrained language models without expensive task-specific fine-tuning. The paper demonstrates COLD on three challenging text generation tasks: lexically-constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning.

In summary, the key problem is performing diverse constrained text generation using off-the-shelf language models. The paper proposes a novel energy-based decoding approach called COLD that provides a unified way to specify constraints and generate samples adhering to those constraints.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper presents Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a new framework for constrained text generation. Constrained generation refers to generating text that satisfies certain requirements, such as including specific keywords or being coherent with a context. COLD formulates constrained decoding as energy-based sampling, where constraints are expressed through an energy function and text is generated by sampling from the induced distribution using Langevin dynamics. This provides a flexible way to incorporate lexical, semantic, and fluency constraints into generation without task-specific fine-tuning.

The resulting soft sequence samples are discretized using language model top-k filtering for fluency. Experiments on lexically constrained decoding, abductive reasoning, and counterfactual story generation demonstrate COLD's effectiveness over both supervised approaches and prior decoding methods. Unique advantages are its general formulation unifying diverse constraints, enabling gradient-based sampling for efficient exploration, and directly leveraging pretrained language models without any fine-tuning. The work provides new insights into constrained decoding through the lens of energy-based modeling and efficient differentiable reasoning.
