# [Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Training-Free Prototype   Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05229)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a simple yet effective training-free prototype calibration strategy called TEEN for few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL). The key insight is that while the feature extractor trained only on base classes cannot represent novel classes well, it can still capture semantic similarity between base and novel classes. The paper first analyzes limitations of existing FSCIL methods, finding they exhibit poor performance on novel classes by misclassifying them into similar base classes. Leveraging semantic similarity, TEEN calibrates biased prototypes of novel classes by fusing them with weighted base prototypes without any training. Experiments across benchmarks demonstrate TEEN not only achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy but also significantly boosts novel class accuracy over prior FSCIL techniques. The consistent gains highlight TEEN's remarkable prototype calibration ability via implicit semantic information, despite being simple and training-free. Overall, this work provides novel analysis into poor novel class recognition in FSCIL and an effective remedy through similarity-based calibration without extra optimization.
