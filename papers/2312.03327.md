# [Building Category Graphs Representation with Spatial and Temporal   Attention for Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03327)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summarizing paragraph for this paper on building category graphs representation with spatial and temporal attention for visual navigation:

The paper proposes a category relation graph (CRG) to learn prior layout knowledge and relations between object categories along with a temporal spatial region (TSR) attention architecture that captures long-term spatial-temporal object dependencies in trajectories. The CRG adapts multiple observations to learn inherent relations between category layouts using a graph convolutional network. TSR contains temporal attention to model the historical structure of observations, spatial attention to uncover spatial context of current observations based on the CRG and past views, and a region attention module to focus visual attention on target-relevant areas. The complete CRG-TSR approach extracts informative visual representations that assist reinforcement learning agents in accurately perceiving environments for superior navigation performance. Experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art navigation accuracy and efficiency on AI2-THOR, significantly improving success rate and path length over previous methods by exploiting both learned category layout knowledge and enriched spatio-temporal representations of observations in trajectories.
