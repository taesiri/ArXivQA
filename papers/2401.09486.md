# [LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09486)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Handling long texts is critical for large language models (LLMs) to achieve deeper language understanding. However, as the text length increases, the resource consumption also increases dramatically. 
- Existing methods for reducing resource usage by compressing the key-value (KV) cache have a major drawback - the compression leads to loss of information. High compression rates increase the probability of losing important information.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA) which can compress KV pairs into special memory tokens without any loss of information, as per a set compression ratio. 

Key Contributions:
- LoMA divides the input text into reading, memory and repetition segments. Special tokens are introduced in memory and repetition areas. 
- A novel attention mask is designed so reading area has a regular autoregressive mask, while memory area tokens have bidirectional visibility into other memory tokens, and repetition tokens can only see the memory area.
- It is mathematically proven that gradients from the loss on repetition area provide supervision to memory area, despite no direct labels. So compression can be learned.
- Experiments on Llama-2-7B model show LoMA can be efficiently trained and achieve 4:1 compression ratio without any loss of information.
- LoMA does not alter model architecture so it simply fine-tunes pretrained models. It also allows segmental compression thereby avoiding cost of full re-compression with each new token.
- Incorporating LoMA during pretraining can make models handle longer texts without compromising existing capabilities.

In summary, the key highlights are an information lossless memory compression mechanism via specialized tokens and attention masking, efficient fine-tuning without architectural changes, and mathematical proof for learning compression - making it suitable for language models to handle longer texts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel lossless compressed memory attention method called LoMA that allows transformer models to compress key-value memory information into specialized tokens according to a set compression ratio, enabling efficient handling of longer text contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA). Specifically:

1) LoMA allows for lossless compression of key-value (KV) memory information into special tokens according to a preset compression ratio. This allows models to handle much longer text contexts without losing critical information.

2) LoMA introduces a reading area, memory area containing compressed KV tokens, and a repetition area that restates the reading area based only on the memory. A proof is provided that gradients from the repetition area will propagate back to train the compression in the memory area, without needing direct supervision.

3) Experiments show LoMA can be efficiently trained into models like LLaMA-7B, achieving high accuracy in compressing and restating text segments. A 4:1 compression ratio is demonstrated with over 70% exact repetition accuracy.

4) LoMA does not alter model architecture and can be added through fine-tuning, making it convenient to integrate into existing models to improve long context handling.

In summary, the main innovation is enabling lossless memory compression through a novel attention masking scheme and training framework, significantly expanding contexts language models can utilize.
