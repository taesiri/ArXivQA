# [RAAMove: A Corpus for Analyzing Moves in Research Article Abstracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Move structures in research article (RA) abstracts are important for understanding the content and significance of academic writing. However, there is a lack of large-scale annotated corpora specifically for analyzing moves in RA abstracts across different academic disciplines.

- This poses barriers for comparative research on move analysis, automatic identification of moves, and applications like computer-assisted language learning.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop RAAMove, a multi-domain corpus annotated with move structures found in RA abstracts from AI (NLP and CV) and Engineering (Communication and Mechanical Engineering).

- They modify Hyland's established 5-move classification to better suit scientific RA abstracts, resulting in 8 move types - Background, Gap, Purpose, Method, Result, Conclusion, Implication and Contribution.

- The corpus was constructed via manual annotation by experts initially, then automatic annotation by a BERT-based model with saliency attribution, followed by expert modification. This ensures quality while scaling up the corpus size.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of a large-scale (33,988 instances), high-quality corpus specifically for move annotation in RA abstracts across multiple domains.

- Suggestion of a revised move classification tailored for scientific RA abstracts and engineering practice.  

- Proposal of an efficient BERT-based model with saliency attribution for automatic corpus expansion while maintaining annotation quality.

- The corpus facilitates various applications like move analysis, writing assistance, language learning as well as NLP tasks related to move identification and discourse analysis.

In summary, the paper introduces an expert-annotated multi-domain corpus for studying move structures in RA abstracts. The revised move classification and automatic annotation model also contribute to the corpus construction. The corpus has diverse applications and enables future research on move analysis.
