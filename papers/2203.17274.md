# [Exploring Visual Prompts for Adapting Large-Scale Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17274)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: Can we create effective "prompts" for vision models by modifying the pixel space of the input images? 

Specifically, the paper investigates the efficacy of "visual prompting" - adapting vision models to new tasks by learning perturbations to the input images while keeping the model parameters frozen. This is inspired by prompting methods in NLP, and explores whether similar ideas can work by creating prompts directly in pixel space for vision models.

The key hypotheses tested are:

- Visual prompting can be an effective way to adapt vision models, competitive with standard approaches like fine-tuning or linear probes.

- Visual prompting may be particularly effective for adapting large-scale vision-language models like CLIP.

- Visual prompts can improve robustness to distribution shift since model parameters stay frozen.

- Properties of the dataset, prompt design, and output mapping affect how well visual prompting works.

So in summary, the central research question is whether vision models can be adapted via input image perturbations as a form of "visual prompting", and how factors like model architecture, dataset, and prompt design impact the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents an investigation into the effectiveness of using visual prompts to adapt large pre-trained vision models to new tasks. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Introduces the concept of "visual prompting", where an input image perturbation (the "prompt") is learned to adapt a frozen pre-trained model to a new task without updating the model weights. This is inspired by prompt tuning in NLP. 

- Performs comprehensive experiments with visual prompting across 4 pre-trained models (CLIP, Big Transfer, Instagram, ResNet) on 15 image classification datasets. 

- Finds that visual prompting works surprisingly well for CLIP, achieving competitive performance to standard linear probe adaptation methods, and is particularly effective for out-of-distribution datasets.

- Analyzes how properties of the downstream dataset, prompt design, and output transformation affect visual prompting performance.

- Provides a new perspective on adapting pre-trained vision models by modifying the input pixel space rather than the model weights or activations. The effectiveness of visual prompting suggests new research directions into pixel-space adaptation methods.

In summary, the key contribution is a broad investigation and analysis of visual prompting for adapting pre-trained vision models, revealing it as a viable and sometimes highly effective approach compared to standard adaptation techniques like fine-tuning and linear probes. The results open up new thinking on how to steer frozen vision models in desired directions by modifying inputs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the effectiveness of using visual prompts (image perturbations) to adapt large pre-trained vision models like CLIP to new downstream tasks without updating the model parameters.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on adapting pre-trained vision models:

- The main contribution is exploring visual prompting, where an input perturbation adapts a frozen pre-trained model to a new task. This is related to adversarial reprogramming and unadversarial examples in the adversarial attack literature. The key difference is that this work focuses on using prompting as a practical and useful adaptation method, rather than an adversarial goal. 

- The paper demonstrates that visual prompting works surprisingly well for CLIP, achieving competitive performance to standard approaches like linear probes and fine-tuning. This is a novel finding, as prior work on adversarial reprogramming focused more on smaller CNN models.

- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis varying different factors like dataset properties, prompt design, and output transformations. This sheds light on when and why visual prompting is effective for adapting vision models.

- The work is similar in spirit to prefix tuning and prompt tuning methods in NLP, which also adapt models by modifying the input space. A key difference is that this paper explores prompts in continuous pixel space rather than discrete text space.

- Compared to other adaptation methods like fine-tuning and linear probes, visual prompting is unique in that it only requires modifying the input, without needing model access at test time. This enables new applications as discussed in the paper.

Overall, this paper explores visual prompting as a new paradigm for adapting vision models, and provides interesting analysis on its effectiveness. The results highlight the surprising viability of input space modifications for steering frozen models, complementing existing literature on parameter/activation modifications. It opens up directions for future work on understanding and improving pixel-space adaptation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Investigating better prompt designs for vision models, as the current work mainly explored simple pixel patches. The authors mention that different visual tasks may benefit from significantly different prompt designs.

- Exploring conditional prompts that are specific to each input, rather than learning a single universal prompt. While universal prompts are more practical, input-conditional prompts may allow for more accurate adaptation.

- Using visual prompts in conjunction with other adaptation methods like fine-tuning or linear probes, rather than just on their own. The authors suggest ensembling prompts could improve performance further.

- Scaling up the size of the pre-trained vision model, as they were limited to smaller public models. Larger models like ViT-L/14 may further boost visual prompting performance. 

- Broadening the applications of visual prompting beyond just steering models towards correct classification. For example, using prompts to modify image-to-image model outputs.

- Better understanding when and why visual prompts are effective at steering deep networks. The authors suggest some hypotheses but further analysis is needed.

In summary, the main future directions are developing better prompt design, exploring conditional prompts, integrating prompts with other methods, using larger models, broadening applications, and further analysis to explain when and why prompts work. The concept of adapting vision models via the input space is new and there are many open questions to explore.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores the efficacy of using visual prompts to adapt large-scale pre-trained models to new tasks in computer vision. The authors investigate an approach called "visual prompting" where a single, fixed image perturbation is learned that steers a frozen model to perform well on a new downstream task when added to the input images. This allows adapting the model to new datasets without updating any parameters, similar to natural language prompting in NLP. 

Through comprehensive experiments on image classification tasks using models like CLIP, Big Transfer, and ResNet, the authors demonstrate that visual prompting is surprisingly effective, achieving competitive performance to standard approaches like linear probes and fine-tuning. They find it works particularly well for CLIP, even outperforming linear probes on some datasets. The authors also analyze how factors like the downstream dataset distribution, prompt design, and output mapping affect performance. Overall, the work provides a new perspective on adapting vision models by only modifying the input pixel space rather than model internals. The effectiveness of visual prompting highlights intriguing properties of these models' latent spaces.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates the efficacy of visual prompting, which involves learning an image perturbation (visual prompt) that adapts a frozen pre-trained model to a new downstream task when added to the input images. The method follows recent approaches in adversarial reprogramming and prefix tuning that treat prompts as continuous vectors optimized via backpropagation. The authors learn a single, input-agnostic visual prompt for each downstream dataset while keeping the pre-trained model fixed. They compare prompting performance with standard approaches like linear probes and fine-tuning for both vision models like ResNets and vision-language models like CLIP across a diverse set of image classification datasets. The visual prompt essentially acts to transform the unfamiliar downstream images into the distribution of the pre-training data without updating the model weights. The results demonstrate surprising effectiveness of prompting for CLIP, achieving competitive accuracy to linear probes, and analyze how factors like dataset distribution, prompt design, and text prompts affect performance. Overall, the work explores visual prompting as a practical data-centric method for adapting frozen visual models.
