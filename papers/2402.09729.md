## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on improving users' quality of experience (QoE) and sense of immersion when using virtual reality (VR) services supported by mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. High latency can significantly harm users' experience and cause discomfort. To address this, the paper introduces a new QoE metric that considers the MEC system's latency, user attention levels based on human vision hierarchy, and user-preferred resolutions to quantify individual users' experience. The goal is to optimize resource allocation of CPU frequency, bandwidth, and resolution across MEC servers to maximize overall QoE for heterogeneous users with diverse preferences under realistic constraints. However, defining the environment and users in advance is challenging, leading to an allocation problem that cannot be directly optimized.

Proposed Solution:
The paper transforms the allocation problem into a reinforcement learning (RL) problem to learn a generalized policy applicable across diverse user environments and MEC servers without needing retraining. It proposes a Federated Prompt-based Decision Transformer (FedPromptDT) framework that utilizes federated learning (FL) to train a prompt-based decision transformer model on decentralized user data across MEC servers. The prompts provide environmental cues (e.g. user numbers and levels) and user-preferred allocation to guide the model to adapt to unseen environments during execution. This exploits the generalization capability of decision transformers and privacy-preserving capability of FL.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new QoE metric integrating MEC latency, attention levels and user resolutions to measure customized experience. Formulates attention-based QoE maximization problem for resource allocation.
- Transforms the problem into an RL problem to learn a generalized policy across user environments and MEC servers.   
- Proposes FedPromptDT framework to utilize FL and prompt-based decision transformer to obtain a generalized policy with privacy preservation and without needing retraining.
- Demonstrates through extensive experiments that FedPromptDT outperforms baselines by achieving superior and consistent performance across diverse user environments.

In summary, the paper presents a scalable and effective FedPromptDT solution for resource allocation to provide customized QoE for heterogeneous users in MEC-supported VR services.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed QoE metric capture the impact of latency, attention levels, and user-preferred resolutions on the user's immersive experience? What are the rationales behind the specific formula?

2) Why is the resource allocation problem formulated as a reinforcement learning problem instead of a conventional optimization problem? What are the key challenges that RL aims to address? 

3) What is the rationale behind using federated learning instead of centralized training to learn the policy model across MEC servers? How does federated learning help improve model generalization?

4) How does the prompt design help FedPromptDT adapt to diverse user environments during online execution? What information does the prompt trajectory provide to guide the model?

5) What are the differences between the training and execution prompts? Why can't the execution prompt be directly sampled from the training trajectories?

6) How does the concatenation of user environment information with system states help FedPromptDT distinguish between environments and generate suitable actions?

7) What are the advantages of using Decision Transformer over value-based RL methods for this resource allocation problem? How does the sequence modeling approach help?

8) Why can fine-tuning further improve the performance of FedPromptDT but not FedDT? What does this suggest about the generalization capability enabled by prompts?

9) How robust is FedPromptDT's performance to variations in the initial reward-to-go, QoE thresholds, system bandwidth/frequency, and federated learning hyperparameters? 

10) What possibilities exist to extend the FedPromptDT framework beyond the customized VR service allocation problem addressed in this paper? What enhancements can be made?
