# [Generalizable Whole Slide Image Classification with Fine-Grained   Visual-Semantic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Whole slide image (WSI) classification is important for computational pathology and disease diagnosis. It is typically formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem.  
- Existing methods rely only on visual features from WSIs and do not leverage accompanying pathological reports, missing critical fine-grained semantic details.  
- Raw pathological reports have diverse formats and contain extraneous information, making it difficult to extract useful insights.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a "Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction (FiVE)" framework that enhances model generalizability by using the interplay between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics extracted from reports.

- Use GPT-4 and manually designed prompts to automatically clean and extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from raw reports to generate standardized slide-level labels.

- Introduce a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module that uses diagnosis prompts to guide instance feature aggregation, enhancing semantic relevance. 

- Implement a patch sampling strategy during training to reduce computational costs while retaining accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneer use of non-standardized WSIs and reports from public databases to develop vision-language model for pathology.

- Introduce fine-grained labeling and TFS module to improve model's semantic comprehension and generalization capabilities.

- Demonstrate strong performance on TCGA Lung Cancer dataset, with over 9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in few-shot experiments. 

- Exhibit robust generalizability, efficient computation through patch sampling, and adaptable transfer learning abilities.

In summary, the key innovation is using fine-grained visual-semantic alignment from standardized reports to develop a highly generalizable and efficient WSI classification framework.
