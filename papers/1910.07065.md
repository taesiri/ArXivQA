# [Reverse derivative categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07065)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research goal is to provide a categorical axiomatization of the reverse derivative, which is an important operation in machine learning and automatic differentiation. Specifically, the key contributions and results appear to be:- Introducing the definition of a "Cartesian reverse differential category", which is a Cartesian left additive category equipped with a reverse differential combinator satisfying certain axioms. This provides a direct axiomatization of categories with a reverse derivative.- Showing that a Cartesian reverse differential category also induces a Cartesian differential category structure, i.e. it has forward derivatives. But the converse is not true - a Cartesian differential category does not necessarily have reverse derivatives. - Proving that a reverse differential category is equivalent to a Cartesian differential category with a dagger (involution) structure on the subcategory of linear maps. The linear maps additionally form an additively enriched category with dagger biproducts.- Characterizing reverse differential categories as precisely Cartesian differential categories with a "contextual linear dagger". So in summary, the key contribution is introducing an axiomatic framework for reverse derivatives in categories, analogous to existing work on forward derivatives, and establishing connections between reverse and forward differential structures. This provides a foundation for building categorical semantics of programming languages with both forward and reverse mode differentiation capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is introducing a categorical framework for reverse derivatives. The key ideas are:- The paper provides a direct axiomatization of a category with a reverse derivative operation, similar to how Cartesian differential categories axiomatize categories with a forward derivative. - It shows that a category with a reverse derivative also has a forward derivative, but not vice versa. A reverse derivative is equivalent to a forward derivative plus a dagger structure on the subcategory of linear maps.- Linear maps in a reverse differential category form an additively enriched category with dagger biproducts. - A reverse differential category is precisely a Cartesian differential category where the subcategory of linear maps forms a dagger fibration with fibered dagger biproducts.In summary, the paper introduces the notion of a reverse differential category, which provides an abstract foundation for reverse mode automatic differentiation used extensively in machine learning. It relates this structure to forward derivatives and establishes several key properties. This provides a basis for further development of categorical semantics for differential programming languages and machine learning systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces the notion of a reverse derivative in category theory, providing axioms for a category equipped with a reverse derivative operator, and shows this is equivalent to a category with forward derivatives that has additional dagger structure.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on categorical semantics for reverse derivatives:- This appears to be the first categorical axiomatization specifically aimed at capturing reverse derivatives. Previous categorical models like Cartesian differential categories focused only on forward derivatives. So this paper fills an important gap.- The key idea of relating reverse derivatives to a dagger structure seems novel. Showing that a reverse derivative is equivalent to a forward derivative plus a dagger on the linear maps is an elegant theoretical insight. - The overall style of axiomatization is similar to prior work on Cartesian differential categories. So this fits nicely into that literature and provides a consistent framework for thinking about derivatives categorically.- The examples considered (polynomials, smooth functions) are standard ones seen in other papers on differentiation in programming languages and machine learning. No major new examples here, but good to see the reverse derivative axioms validated on familiar settings.- Making connections to things like the dual fibration and dagger categories links this with broader ideas in category theory. Integrating reverse derivatives with other structures like restriction categories is noted as important future work.- Compared to some other categorical semantics research, the development here seems fairly self-contained and focused specifically on reverse derivatives. Not a lot of links drawn to other active areas like type theory or logic.Overall, I would say this is an incremental but valuable step forward in categorical semantics for differentiation. It carves out the niche of reverse derivatives and develops that theory in a focused way. Lots of opportunities exist to build on this and connect it to other ideas in semantics and programming languages. But the core conceptual contributions around relating reverse and forward derivatives via dagger categories seem like a useful conceptual advance.
