# [From Partial to Strictly Incremental Constituent Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies incremental constituent parsing, where the parser processes an input sentence left-to-right and produces partial parse trees as it reads each new word. Most recent parsers rely on bidirectional encoders like BERT and bidirectional decoders, which have access to the full sentence before producing any output. This does not reflect incremental, online processing. The paper argues for the importance of studying strictly incremental parsing to better model human language processing and enable real-time applications like speech parsing.

Methods:
The paper proposes a set of strictly incremental encoder-decoder parsers. The incremental encoders are based on generative language models like GPT and BLOOM which encode sentences left-to-right. The decoders are either: (1) a sequence labeling parser that assigns each token a label encoding the partial parse or (2) a transition-based parser using graph neural networks to represent partial parse states. Both decoders produce partial parse trees using only the left context. The models are evaluated on English PTB and multilingual SPMRL treebanks.

Contributions:
- Introduces fully incremental constituent parsing models with incremental encoders and decoders. Past works claiming incrementality often only enforce it partially.
- Studies two decoder approaches - sequence labeling and transition-based parsing - for incremental decoding. 
- Evaluates on diverse languages to study impact of incrementality across languages and pretraining availability.
- Finds that incremental encoders are the main challenge compared to bidirectional models. Small reading delays help significantly.
- Provides analysis of incremental parsing performance on different constituent types.

The paper demonstrates approaches for and challenges with strictly incremental constituent parsing using modern neural models. The analysis provides insights into developing more human-like incremental parsers.
