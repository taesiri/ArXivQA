# [From Partial to Strictly Incremental Constituent Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies incremental constituent parsing, where the parser processes an input sentence left-to-right and produces partial parse trees as it reads each new word. Most recent parsers rely on bidirectional encoders like BERT and bidirectional decoders, which have access to the full sentence before producing any output. This does not reflect incremental, online processing. The paper argues for the importance of studying strictly incremental parsing to better model human language processing and enable real-time applications like speech parsing.

Methods:
The paper proposes a set of strictly incremental encoder-decoder parsers. The incremental encoders are based on generative language models like GPT and BLOOM which encode sentences left-to-right. The decoders are either: (1) a sequence labeling parser that assigns each token a label encoding the partial parse or (2) a transition-based parser using graph neural networks to represent partial parse states. Both decoders produce partial parse trees using only the left context. The models are evaluated on English PTB and multilingual SPMRL treebanks.

Contributions:
- Introduces fully incremental constituent parsing models with incremental encoders and decoders. Past works claiming incrementality often only enforce it partially.
- Studies two decoder approaches - sequence labeling and transition-based parsing - for incremental decoding. 
- Evaluates on diverse languages to study impact of incrementality across languages and pretraining availability.
- Finds that incremental encoders are the main challenge compared to bidirectional models. Small reading delays help significantly.
- Provides analysis of incremental parsing performance on different constituent types.

The paper demonstrates approaches for and challenges with strictly incremental constituent parsing using modern neural models. The analysis provides insights into developing more human-like incremental parsers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies strictly incremental constituent parsers using generative language models as encoders and transition-based or sequence labeling decoders, evaluating them on English and several other languages to assess performance compared to non-incremental parsers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the study of the viability and challenges of fully incremental encoder-decoder constituent parsers. Specifically:

- They build strictly incremental constituent parsers that process sentences from left to right, adding each read word to the partial tree based only on the prefix seen so far. 

- They use generative language models (like GPT and BLOOM) for the incremental encoders.

- They explore two types of incremental decoders: one based on parsing as tagging, and one based on transition-based parsing using graph neural networks.

- They test these incremental models on English and several other languages using multilingual treebanks. 

- They also simulate human reading strategies by allowing the models to peek ahead by 1 or 2 upcoming words.

- They conduct an analysis to compare the incremental parsers against non-incremental parsers as well as partially incremental baseline systems.

In summary, the key contribution is a thorough study of strictly incremental constituent parsing, assessing the viability and tradeoffs compared to non-incremental methods across languages. The paper provides insights into remaining challenges for incremental techniques in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper studies incremental constituent parsing. What is the key motivation behind developing incremental models for this task compared to non-incremental parsers? Discuss the relevance of incrementality in areas like real-time NLP and interdisciplinary research.

2. The paper refers to previous constituent parsing models as only enforcing incrementality on either the encoder or decoder. Explain what this means and why the authors argue this does not adhere to a strong definition of incrementality. 

3. The incremental encoders rely on generative language models (LLMs) without and with pre-training. Compare mGPT, BLOOM-560M and the LSTM encoder in terms of pre-training data availability across languages. How does this allow the analysis of different conditions?

4. Explain the two proposed incremental decoder architectures in detail - the tagging-based decoder and the transition-based decoder. What are the key strengths and weaknesses of each? 

5. Analyze the results in Table 1 across encoders, decoders and languages. What are the main observations regarding the viability of fully incremental constituent parsing? Where does the biggest gap remain compared to non-incremental counterparts?

6. Explain the concept of small positive delays in human reading strategies. How were these delays simulated in the incremental parsers? What were the results in Table 2 of incorporating delays on overall parser performance?

7. Analyze Figure 3 showing F1-scores per constituent type. How does incrementality affect longer phrases differently across languages? Why does a delay help more significantly for sequence labeling decoders?  

8. Discuss the limitations of the analysis, including aspects like non-monotonicity, discontinuous constituents, lower resourced languages, multilingual LM availability and computational constraints. 

9. Could incremental constituent parsing inform computational models that better simulate human language processing? What aspects would need to be strengthened to achieve this?

10. The paper concludes that challenges may still center around effectively encoding under strict incrementality. What are some research directions suggested, like prophecy tokens, that could help mitigate this?
