# [Towards Practical Plug-and-Play Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05973)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can external guidance models be practically integrated with diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner for conditional image generation? 

The key hypotheses are:

1) A single external guidance model fine-tuned on noisy data fails to effectively guide diffusion models due to the diverse noise levels encountered during diffusion. 

2) Using multiple expert guidance models, each specializing in a specific noise level range, can improve guidance performance.

3) Transferring knowledge from pre-trained models to the expert guidance models allows plug-and-play integration without requiring task-specific labeled data.

4) Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the expert guidance models allows scaling to multiple experts without prohibitive compute/memory costs.

The paper proposes a framework termed "Practical Plug-and-Play" (PPAP) that leverages multiple expert guidance models,  parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and data-free knowledge transfer to enable plug-and-play integration of external models with diffusion for controllable image generation. Experiments on class-conditional ImageNet generation and steering unconditional GLIDE models provide support for the hypotheses.
