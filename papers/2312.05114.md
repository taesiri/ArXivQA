# [On the Inadequacy of Similarity-based Privacy Metrics: Reconstruction   Attacks against "Truly Anonymous Synthetic Data''](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05114)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper analyzes the privacy metrics and filters commonly used by synthetic data companies to empirically guarantee privacy. The authors demonstrate several critical flaws with relying solely on similarity-based metrics, including lack of theoretical guarantees, treating privacy as a binary property, non-contrastive computations, and more. To highlight these weaknesses, they propose ReconSyn, a novel reconstruction attack that recovers the majority of underrepresented training records (outliers) by querying the privacy metrics and a single trained generative model. Experiments across five datasets and models show that ReconSyn successfully reconstructs at least 78% of outliers in all settings. Crucially, the attack remains effective even when the models satisfy differential privacy or have severely restricted modeling capabilities. Overall, the paper serves as a stark warning against attempts to ensure privacy purely through empirical evaluations rather than established privacy-preserving techniques. It advises practitioners to prioritize privacy and rely on notions like differential privacy when working with sensitive data.
