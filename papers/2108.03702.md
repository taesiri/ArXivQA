# [BIGRoC: Boosting Image Generation via a Robust Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03702)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is: How can a robust classifier be leveraged to improve the image quality and distribution fidelity of images generated by existing generative models, in a model-agnostic way?The key hypothesis is that by using a robust classifier that exhibits perceptually aligned gradients to iteratively modify generated images, both the perceptual quality and faithfulness to the data distribution can be improved for a wide variety of generative models. The proposed method, called BIGRoC, aims to demonstrate that a single robust classifier can be used to refine the outputs of many different generative models, from simple to state-of-the-art, without needing to access or retrain those models. Experiments are conducted on various generative models for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.In summary, the central research question is how to harness robust classifiers to boost image generation performance in a model-agnostic way, with the hypothesis that this can significantly enhance image quality and distribution fidelity across diverse generative models.
