# [Leveraging Enhanced Queries of Point Sets for Vectorized Map   Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17430)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High definition (HD) maps play a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, providing vectorized map elements like lanes, boundaries, etc. 
- Traditional SLAM-based HD map construction methods have challenges like complex pipelines, high costs, notable localization errors.
- Recent learning-based online map construction methods treat it as a segmentation or object detection task, producing rasterized outputs requiring post-processing to obtain vectors.
- More recent works formulate it as a point set prediction problem within DETR-like frameworks for end-to-end vectorized map construction. However, they use point queries which can lead to inconsistent content information for the same map element.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes MapQR, an end-to-end DETR-like model for online vectorized map construction, with emphasis on enhancing query capabilities.
- Uses instance queries instead of point queries, which are scattered to predict point sets and gathered back, sharing content information and avoiding inconsistencies. This scatter-gather query shares content in a map element.
- Enhances queries by adding positional embeddings generated from reference points, allowing usage of prior information.
- Also improves the BEV encoder by adding flexibility in sampling height locations.

Main Contributions:
- Novel scatter-gather query design for point set prediction in DETR-like models, sharing content information and allowing more queries without memory overhead.
- Compatible positional embedding generation from reference points for the queries.
- Overall MapQR model with the above designs achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets for online map construction.
- Demonstrates benefit of integrating the core query design into other methods, improving their performance.

In summary, the paper explores query mechanisms for online vectorized map construction, designing a scatter-gather query approach with positional embeddings to share content information in map elements accurately. This lifts performance of both the proposed MapQR model as well as other methods integrated with this design.
