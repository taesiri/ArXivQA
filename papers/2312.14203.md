# [Shai: A large language model for asset management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14203)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Asset management is a complex field that can benefit from advanced AI solutions like large language models (LLMs). However, existing open-source finance LLMs may lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge and adaptation for practical asset management applications.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop "Shai", a 10B parameter LLM specifically tailored for asset management using targeted pre-training and fine-tuning.

Key Contributions:
- Construct an asset management focused 10B LLM with enhanced performance on relevant tasks compared to mainstream open-source models.
- Share detailed construction process - continuous pre-training on asset management data followed by supervised fine-tuning.  
- Propose a comprehensive evaluation framework combining financial exams, open-ended QA, tailored tasks and safety assessments. Shai outperforms comparable models.  
- Findings: Task-related pre-training provides advantages on downstream tasks. Evaluating large language models like GPT-4 reveals biases related to answer position and length.
- Showcase potential of 10B LLMs in asset management with strong capabilities and modest compute requirements. Provide methodology to assist industry adoption.

In summary, the authors develop a 10B parameter asset management focused LLM, detail its training methodology, evaluate it thoroughly and highlight its capabilities as well as evaluation challenges, demonstrating the promise of large language models in this complex financial domain.
