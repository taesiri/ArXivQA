# [From Guidelines to Governance: A Study of AI Policies in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15601)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
With the increasing use of AI technologies like ChatGPT in education, there is a lack of clear policies and guidelines governing their ethical implementation. This creates risks around issues like student privacy, transparency, bias, and plagiarism. 

The paper investigates two key questions:
1) What is the current policy landscape regarding AI/LLMs in US educational institutions?  
2) What are administrators' perspectives on ideal policies and their key focus areas?

Methodology: 
The authors surveyed over 100 high school principals and higher education provosts in 5 US states using a mix of multiple choice and free-form questions to capture both quantifiable metrics and subjective viewpoints.

Key Findings:
- 80% of colleges are developing policies, but only 50% of high schools are. This indicates a policy gap between types of institutions.
- Most current policies are inadequate in coverage and fail to address risks unique to AI systems.  
- Administrators recognize the critical importance of developing specialized AI policies focused on ethics, plagiarism prevention and student safety.
- Suggested policy approaches emphasize flexible frameworks that can adapt quickly to evolving technologies.

Main Contributions:
- Documents the lack of adequate AI policies, especially in US high schools, and highlights key gaps like transparency and bias.
- Captures administrator attitudes showing support for urgent policy development governing ethical AI use.  
- Provides initial data and recommendations to guide policymakers in building effective and collaborative AI governance tailored to education.
- Underscores need for iterative policies that keep pace with AI advancement to ensure responsible integration.

The paper ultimately demonstrates the nascency of AI policies in US education and calls for developing adaptive and comprehensive ethical frameworks through multi-stakeholder participation.
