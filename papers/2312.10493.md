# [Debiasing Multimodal Sarcasm Detection with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) models rely heavily on textual cues and overlook spurious correlations between words and labels, limiting their generalization ability. 
- The paper defines a new out-of-distribution (OOD) MSD task to evaluate model generalization under different training/testing word distributions.

Proposed Solution: 
- A novel debiasing MSD framework (DMSD-CL) with contrastive learning to mitigate reliance on superficial word biases.
- It has two key components:
   1) Counterfactual data augmentation to construct positive/negative sample pairs with dissimilar/similar word biases but same/opposite labels.
   2) Adapted debiasing contrastive learning to discriminate samples based on task-relevant semantics rather than biased words.

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the novel OOD MSD problem to assess model generalization.
- Develops the DMSD-CL framework to debias MSD models via contrastive learning.
   - Devises tailored augmentation strategies for sarcastic/non-sarcastic samples.
   - Employs a re-weighted contrastive loss to focus on challenging samples.
- Constructs a new OOD testing set based on an existing MSD dataset.
- Experiments show DMSD-CL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both IID and OOD settings.
   - Ablations validate the utility of individual framework components.

In summary, the paper tackles the issue of superficial word bias in MSD by proposing a novel debiasing framework DMSD-CL using contrastive learning and counterfactual augmentation. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness for generalization under distribution shift.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel debiasing multimodal sarcasm detection framework with counterfactual data augmentation and adapted debiasing contrastive learning to mitigate the reliance on biased words and learn more robust task-relevant representations for better generalization, including evaluation on a newly constructed out-of-distribution testing set.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It defines a novel out-of-distribution (OOD) multimodal sarcasm detection task to evaluate models' generalization ability when the word distribution differs between training and testing. 

2. It proposes a debiasing multimodal sarcasm detection framework with contrastive learning, which uses counterfactual data augmentation to construct positive and negative samples and employs an adapted debiasing contrastive learning mechanism to mitigate the effect of biased words and learn robust task-relevant features.

3. It constructs an OOD testing set based on an existing multimodal sarcasm detection dataset to evaluate models in the OOD setting. 

4. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on both the original testing set and the constructed OOD testing set, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key innovation lies in defining the OOD generalization task for multimodal sarcasm detection and proposing a novel contrastive learning based framework to address the reliance on biased words and enhance models' generalization capability. The constructed OOD testing set and extensive experiments further verify the superiority of the proposed approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multimodal sarcasm detection (MSD) - The task of identifying sarcastic or ironic intent from both textual and visual modalities in social media posts.

- Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization - Evaluating model performance when the testing data distribution differs from the training distribution, to assess robustness. 

- Spurious correlations - Superficial statistical relationships between input features like words and output labels that do not capture true semantic connections. These can mislead models.

- Debiasing - Methods to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations so models rely more on meaningful feature-label relationships.

- Contrastive learning - A technique to learn robust representations by drawing positive samples closer and pushing negative samples apart in the representation space.

- Counterfactual data augmentation - Generating additional training samples with similar surface features but different labels compared to original data samples.

- Adaptive debiasing contrastive learning - The proposed contrastive learning approach with reweighted loss to focus more on challenging positive and negative pairs.

- Generalization ability - A model's capacity to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution test data, indicating learning of robust representations not specific to the training data distribution.
