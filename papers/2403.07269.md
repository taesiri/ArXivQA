# [MPS: A New Method for Selecting the Stable Closed-Loop Equilibrium   Attitude-Error Quaternion of a UAV During Flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07269)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Controlling the attitude of drones using quaternion feedback can result in two possible equilibrium states - one stable and one unstable. This poses challenges for performance and efficiency during aggressive maneuvers. 
- Existing methods to select the stable equilibrium rely only on instantaneous state, not predicting future state. This can still result in unwinding motions or reverse rotations that degrade performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new model predictive selection (MPS) method to dynamically choose the stable equilibrium attitude-error quaternion that minimizes a performance cost function over a prediction horizon.  
- The cost function accounts for both control effort (torque input) and tracking error. The prediction uses a dynamic model of the drone derived from first principles.
- The sign of a term in the control law is switched based on comparing costs of the two equilibrium options over the horizon. This prevents reverse rotations.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of MPS concept to dynamically select quaternion equilibrium in aggressive flight based on finite-horizon performance prediction.
- Experimental demonstration of proposed MPS method compared to a benchmark method in 100 real-time yaw tracking tests.
- The MPS method reduced the performance cost metric by 60.30% on average compared to the benchmark, showing superior efficiency.
- To the authors' knowledge, first real-time flight tests thoroughly demonstrating and evaluating performance of a method that selects quaternion equilibrium.

In summary, the key innovation is the model predictive approach to select the most efficient quaternion equilibrium for a drone, improving performance in aggressive maneuvers. Extensive flight tests validate the efficiency gains using the proposed technique.
