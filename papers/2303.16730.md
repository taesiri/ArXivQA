# [TTA-COPE: Test-Time Adaptation for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16730)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation without accessing the source domain or labeled target data during test time. 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a novel method called TTA-COPE (Test-Time Adaptation for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation) to handle domain shifts from source (e.g. synthetic) to target (e.g. real-world) without requiring any labels on the target data. 

- Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods for this task still depend on the source domain data during adaptation and do offline batch training. However, TTA-COPE adapts the model sequentially in an online manner without accessing the source data, which is more practical for real applications.

- The authors design a pose ensemble approach with self-training loss to effectively generate robust pseudo labels and infer accurate poses during test-time adaptation. This handles the noise and errors inherently present when using pseudo-labels for self-training.

- Experiments validate that the proposed method outperforms strong test-time adaptation baselines and achieves state-of-the-art under both semi-supervised and fully unsupervised settings.

In summary, the key research question is how to perform online test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation without any target labels or access to the source domain. The paper proposes a novel pose ensemble strategy with self-training loss to address this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation called TTA-COPE. The key ideas are:

- TTA-COPE is the first approach to do test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation. It handles domain shifts from source to target without requiring target labels or access to source data at test time.

- A pose ensemble method is proposed that utilizes predictions from both a teacher and student model to generate robust pseudo labels for training the student, as well as for estimating accurate poses at inference time. 

- A self-training loss is designed using the pose ensemble that helps align the target predictions to the observed target point cloud. This reduces the domain gap.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance compared to strong baselines under semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. The benefits of the pose ensemble and self-training loss are demonstrated through ablation studies.

In summary, the main contribution is being the first work to do test-time adaptation for category-level object pose, and proposing the pose ensemble and self-training loss to effectively adapt the model online without target labels or access to source data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a test-time adaptation method for category-level object pose estimation that handles domain shifts without labeling target data and without accessing source data during test time.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research in category-level object pose estimation:

- It focuses on test-time adaptation (TTA), adapting a pretrained model to a new target domain without access to source data or target labels. Most prior work has focused on offline unsupervised domain adaptation. TTA is more practical but also more challenging.

- The proposed method uses a pose ensemble approach to generate pseudo labels and infer poses. This allows filtering unreliable pseudo labels and making the adaptation process more robust. Other methods have not used pose-specific strategies.

- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the REAL275 dataset compared to other unsupervised methods. The method also outperforms standard TTA baselines like TENT.

- Unlike some prior work that requires multiple models (one per category), this method efficiently adapts all categories with a single model.

- The proposed self-training loss based on transformed point clouds provides an unsupervised training signal to align the target predictions with the observations. This is a simple but effective strategy.

Overall, the key novelty of this work is in formulating and addressing the test-time adaptation problem for category-level pose estimation. The pose ensemble and self-training losses seem to work well, but the main contribution is in identifying this practical problem setting and showing it can effectively adapt to new target domains. This represents an advance over prior offline unsupervised work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the method to also adapt the segmentation model and 2D labels during test time. Currently, TTA-COPE only generates pseudo labels for 6D pose and does not affect the segmentation model. Jointly adapting the segmentation model could lead to further performance improvements.

- Using a differentiable pose estimation method instead of relying on non-differentiable pose estimation like Umeyama. This could allow end-to-end training and optimization of the full model. The authors suggest exploring methods like TheseusNet.

- Applying the test-time adaptation approach to other tasks beyond category-level 6D object pose estimation. The authors have demonstrated the benefits for this specific task, but the overall idea could potentially be extended to other vision tasks.

- Evaluating the method on more complex real-world datasets with greater domain shifts. The experiments are mainly on relatively simple indoor tabletop scenes. Testing on more challenging real-world data could reveal opportunities for improvement.

- Combining with other complementary self-supervised or unsupervised learning techniques to further reduce the need for labels.

- Developing online adaptation methods that can handle continually changing distributions during test time. The current method assumes a stationary test distribution.

In summary, the main future directions are around extending the approach to more tasks and scenarios, combining it with other self-supervised methods, enabling end-to-end joint adaptation, and evaluating on more complex and dynamic test distributions. The core idea shows promise on simpler datasets so far.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This CVPR 2022 paper proposes TTA-COPE, a method for test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation. The goal is to handle domain shifts from source to target data without requiring labels on the target data. The method consists of a two-stage learning scheme. First, a network is pretrained on labeled source data. Then at test time, the pretrained model is adapted on unlabeled target data in an online manner. To enable this, batch normalization is added to the network. The main contributions are a pose ensemble approach and a self-training loss to generate robust pseudo labels and perform accurate pose estimation. Specifically, the pose ensemble jointly utilizes teacher and student model predictions based on pose-aware confidence for both pseudo label generation and inference. The self-training loss helps reduce the domain gap. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance compared to strong test-time adaptation baselines under semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. The proposed pose ensemble and self-training loss are shown to be beneficial.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a method for test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation called TTA-COPE. The goal is to handle domain shifts from source to target data without requiring target labels or access to source data during test time. The authors design a pose ensemble approach with self-training loss using pose-aware confidence. Specifically, they use an ensemble of teacher-student models to generate robust pseudo labels and also perform inference. The pose ensemble selects the pose with higher confidence based on inlier counts for both pseudo label generation and final inference. In addition, a self-training loss is used alongside the pseudo label loss to reduce the domain gap. Experiments compare against test-time adaptation baselines and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. The pose ensemble and self-training loss are shown to provide noticeable gains.

In summary, the key ideas presented are: 1) A pose ensemble method that leverages teacher and student models for pseudo label generation and inference based on pose-aware confidence. 2) A self-training loss that complements the pseudo label loss and reduces the domain shift. 3) Comparisons showing the benefits of the proposed approach over test-time adaptation baselines for category-level object pose estimation in the challenging unlabeled target setting. The method is the first to investigate this practical test-time adaptation scenario for category-level pose estimation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a test-time adaptation method for category-level object pose estimation called TTA-COPE. The method consists of two stages - first the network is pretrained on labeled source data in a supervised manner. Then the pretrained model is adapted on unlabeled target data without accessing the source data, which is a more challenging setting. For test-time adaptation, the method designs a pose ensemble approach that utilizes predictions from both a teacher and student model to generate robust pseudo labels and accurate pose estimates. Specifically, it calculates a pose-aware confidence score based on the number of inlier points to determine which pose prediction from the teacher or student model is more reliable. This pose ensemble is used for both generating pseudo labels to train the student model and for the final pose inference. Additionally, a self-training loss is used that enforces consistency between the student's predicted NOCS map and the transformed observed depth points, which helps adapt to the target domain. Experiments show the pose ensemble and self-training loss improve performance under semi-supervised and unsupervised settings.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation. Specifically, it aims to handle domain shifts from source (e.g. synthetic) data to target (e.g. real-world) data at test time, without requiring any labeled data from the target domain. 

The key issues and questions it seeks to address are:

- How can we adapt a category-level object pose estimation model to a new target domain in an online manner at test time, without accessing the source domain data? This is a more challenging setting than standard unsupervised domain adaptation.

- Existing test-time adaptation methods like TENT are designed for classification/segmentation tasks. How can we effectively adapt them for the more complex pose estimation task?

- Pseudo-labeling and self-training strategies have issues with noisy/unreliable labels. How can we generate robust pseudo labels and train the model reliably for pose estimation during test time?

- What is an effective way to leverage predictions from both teacher and student models during test-time adaptation for this task?

- Can a pose-aware confidence measure and ensemble approach help address noise and improve adaptation? 

- How do we design losses and objectives that enable effective online test-time adaptation for category-level pose estimation in the absence of target labels?

So in summary, the key focus is on developing a test-time adaptation framework specifically designed for category-level object pose estimation, which can handle domain shift issues online without access to source data or target labels. The paper explores pose-aware techniques to achieve this.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Test-time adaptation (TTA): Adapting a pretrained model to a new target domain during test time without access to the source training data. The paper proposes TTA for category-level object pose estimation.

- Category-level object pose estimation: Estimating the 6D pose of object categories rather than specific object instances. More broadly applicable than instance-level pose estimation.

- Unsupervised / Semi-supervised: Not requiring ground truth labels on the target domain data during training/adaptation. The proposed method is unsupervised (no target labels) or semi-supervised (only 2D segmentation masks on target data).

- Pose ensemble: Simultaneously using predictions from both the teacher and student models for pseudo label generation and inference. Combines predictions based on pose-aware confidence.

- Self-training loss: Additional loss term that helps the model learn the target distribution by comparing predicted NOCS maps to observed target point clouds. Reduces domain gap.

- Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS): Object coordinate system that aligns objects within a category. Used to represent correspondence for pose estimation.

- Online adaptation: Updating the model sequentially on each new target sample rather than batch training. Enables real-time adaptation.

- Source-free: Not requiring access to the source training data during test-time adaptation. More practical but challenging.

In summary, the key focus is on test-time adaptation for category-level pose estimation in an unsupervised, online manner without accessing the source data. The proposed method uses pose ensemble and self-training techniques.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the fundamental question of whether it is possible to obtain low regret in the online learning with experts problem using limited memory. The key hypothesis is that there exist algorithms that can achieve vanishing regret (i.e. regret that is o(T) where T is the number of rounds) while using only sublinear memory in the number of experts n and the number of rounds T. 

Specifically, the paper makes the following main contributions:

1. For the oblivious adversary setting, the paper presents an algorithm that obtains ~O(sqrt(nT/S)) regret using only S memory, nearly matching the lower bound of Ω(sqrt(nT/S)) from prior work. This resolves the open question of whether vanishing regret is possible with limited memory against an oblivious adversary.

2. For the adaptive adversary setting, the paper gives an algorithm that obtains ~O(sqrt(nT/S)) regret with ~O(sqrt(n)) memory, proving that sublinear memory suffices to obtain vanishing regret even against an adaptive adversary. 

3. The paper also provides a new lower bound showing that Ω(sqrt(n)) memory is necessary against an adaptive adversary, proving the optimality of the proposed algorithm.

Overall, this paper significantly advances our understanding of the memory-regret tradeoffs for online learning with experts, obtaining nearly tight upper and lower bounds in both the oblivious and adaptive settings. The techniques introduced, including robust pooling/pruning methods and novel regret amortization schemes, are important contributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides a new online learning algorithm against an oblivious adversary that achieves near-optimal memory-regret tradeoff. Specifically, the algorithm uses $\text{polylog}(nT)$ space and obtains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nT})$ regret, nearly matching the lower bound of Ω(\sqrt{nT/S}) proved in prior work. This resolves the open question on optimal memory-regret tradeoff posed by previous work. 

2. It gives the first online learning algorithm against an adaptive adversary that achieves sublinear regret using sublinear space. In particular, the algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ space and achieves $o(T)$ regret.

3. It provides a novel lower bound showing that $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ space is necessary to obtain $o(T)$ regret against an adaptive adversary. This lower bound is based on a reduction to the direct sum problem in communication complexity.

4. The techniques introduced, including the eviction rules for maintaining experts, interval regret guarantees, and the accounting scheme for amortizing regret, seem novel and potentially useful for other online learning problems.

In summary, this paper significantly advances our understanding of the interplay between memory and regret in online learning against oblivious and adaptive adversaries. The memory-regret tradeoffs obtained are essentially optimal, resolving open questions from prior work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper provides improved algorithms and lower bounds for online learning with limited memory against oblivious and adaptive adversaries, nearly resolving the memory-regret tradeoff.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several important contributions to the field of online learning theory with limited memory:

1. It presents new algorithms for online learning against oblivious and adaptive adversaries that achieve near-optimal memory-regret tradeoffs. Specifically, against an oblivious adversary the algorithm achieves Õ(nT/S) regret using S memory, nearly matching known lower bounds. Against an adaptive adversary, the algorithm achieves Õ(√nT/S) regret using S memory. 

2. The algorithm against oblivious adversaries improves upon prior work by Peng and Zhang (2022) by using a more sophisticated eviction strategy and analysis. Key innovations include a "covering benchmark" for deciding which experts to evict, as well as a robust eviction procedure that is insensitive to changes in the expert pool. 

3. The algorithm against adaptive adversaries is novel, as prior work focused on oblivious adversaries. The high level approach of maintaining a pool of "random" and "long-term" experts is new in this context. The analysis relating the performance of random and long-term experts is also novel.

4. The lower bound against adaptive adversaries of Ω(√n/ε) memory for o(ε^2T) regret is new. The reduction to a communication problem and application of direct product theorems is an interesting proof technique in this setting. 

5. The work further develops the nascent area of understanding memory-regret tradeoffs in online learning. It significantly improves tradeoffs for both oblivious and adaptive adversaries compared to prior work, and leaves open many interesting questions on tight tradeoffs in other settings.

In summary, this paper pushes forward the state-of-the-art in memory-limited online learning through new algorithmic ideas and lower bound techniques. The near tight bounds obtained are a major advance over prior work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the ideas to develop sub-linear space algorithms for other online learning problems and applications where experts advice is used. The authors suggest it is interesting to see if their techniques can lead to better space-bounded algorithms for multi-arm bandits, pure exploration, game playing agents, optimization algorithms, etc. that rely on experts.

- Understanding the memory-regret tradeoffs with additional structure on the experts or loss functions. The general worst-case bounds may not be tight if there is extra structure like small Littlestone dimension for the experts or succinct representation for loss vectors. 

- Developing algorithms that work in more restrictive models like bandit feedback. The current work relies heavily on full-information feedback so extending the techniques to bandit settings is an open direction.

- Improving the space complexity and regret bounds. There is still a gap between the upper and lower bounds so closing this gap in terms of dependence on key parameters is an open problem.

- Generalizing the adaptive adversary results. The adaptive bounds currently hold for the standard adversary but extending them to other notions like the stronger adaptive adversary is an open question.

- Applying the techniques for online learning with restrictions on memory to other machine learning problems with limited memory, like continual learning.

So in summary, the main directions are: exploring applications to other online learning settings, incorporating structural assumptions, considering bandit feedback, tightening bounds, handling stronger adversaries, and connections to broader machine learning problems with memory constraints. The combination of online learning and space-bounded computation seems like a fruitful area for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies the problem of online learning with limited memory, where the learner has insufficient space to store information about all experts over many time steps. It focuses on the tradeoff between the memory used by the learner and the regret, which measures how much worse the learner performs compared to the best expert in hindsight. The paper gives a new algorithm against an oblivious adversary, improving upon prior work and nearly matching a known lower bound. It also considers an adaptive adversary and gives both a new algorithm and a novel lower bound, showing that roughly √n memory is necessary and sufficient to obtain a sublinear regret. The algorithms are simple and computationally efficient, using ideas like robust pooling, merging and pruning of experts. The lower bounds employ reductions from communication complexity problems. Overall, the paper significantly advances our understanding of the memory requirements for online learning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies the memory-regret tradeoffs for the online learning with expert advice problem. In this problem, there are n experts and over T rounds, the learner has to pick one expert per round and suffers the loss of that expert, while observing the losses of all experts. The goal is to minimize regret, which is the difference between the learner's total loss and the loss of the best expert in hindsight. 

The paper provides new algorithms and lower bounds for this problem in the limited memory setting, where the learner cannot store the entire history. For an oblivious adversary, the paper gives an algorithm using polylog(nT) memory that achieves nearly optimal Õ(√nT) regret. For an adaptive adversary, the paper gives an Õ(sqrt(n)/eps) memory algorithm with O(epsT) regret. It also proves an Ω(sqrt(n)/eps) memory lower bound, showing the algorithm is nearly optimal. The techniques involve carefully merging and filtering experts while bounding the memory, exploiting properties of second order regret algorithms, and reductions from communication complexity problems. Overall, this provides an almost complete understanding of the memory-regret tradeoff for online learning against oblivious and adaptive adversaries.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new online learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal memory-regret tradeoffs against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries. For the oblivious setting, the key ideas are a new eviction rule based on covering benchmarks and a robust merging procedure to control the pool size. The algorithm runs in epochs, maintaining disjoint subpools that are merged periodically. Experts are evicted if covered by a filter set, selected in a way that is insensitive to perturbations. To optimize regret, multiple threads with inherited pools are maintained, and regret is amortized over carefully constructed intervals. For the adaptive setting, the algorithm maintains random short-term experts to hedge performance and selectively retains good experts for longer epochs. The analysis handles adaptive attacks by isolating randomness and reducing to an oblivious adversary per epoch. Overall, the methods develop new techniques for online learning under memory constraints, achieving near-optimal regret while using limited space.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper addresses the fundamental tradeoff between memory usage and regret guarantees in online learning algorithms. Specifically, it considers the online learning problem where an agent sequentially makes decisions by following the advice of "experts", and after each decision observes the loss incurred by all experts. 

The key question is - how well can an agent perform if it has limited memory and cannot store full information about all experts over a long time horizon? 

Previous work showed tight memory-regret tradeoffs when losses are i.i.d. or randomly ordered. This paper focuses on the setting without stochastic assumptions, considering both an oblivious adversary and an adaptive adversary.

The main contributions are:

1) An improved algorithm against an oblivious adversary, attaining nearly optimal memory-regret tradeoffs.

2) The first algorithm and lower bound for the adaptive adversary case, showing that $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ memory is both necessary and sufficient for obtaining sublinear regret.

So in summary, this paper pushes forward our understanding of the interplay between memory and regret in online learning, providing tight bounds in the non-stochastic setting for both oblivious and adaptive adversaries. The techniques develop new ideas like robust pooling mechanisms and careful epoch accounting that may find broader applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract, some key terms and concepts include:

- Online learning - The problem of an agent making sequential decisions in an unknown, changing environment. The abstract focuses on the experts setting where the agent chooses between advice from different "experts".

- Regret - The difference between the agent's cumulative loss and the loss of the single best expert in hindsight. Minimizing regret is a key goal. 

- Memory bounds - Studying online learning algorithms that use limited memory, as opposed to traditional algorithms that may require remembering all experts' losses so far.

- Oblivious vs adaptive adversary - The abstract considers both an oblivious adversary who chooses losses ahead of time, and an adaptive adversary who can react to the agent's past actions.

- Memory-regret tradeoff - A main contribution is characterizing the tradeoff between the amount of memory used by the algorithm and the regret it can achieve.

- Lower bounds - The abstract provides both upper bounds (new algorithms) and lower bounds, showing limitations on what is possible with limited memory.

In summary, this seems to be a theoretical computer science paper studying fundamental tradeoffs between memory and regret in online learning against different types of adversaries. The key innovations are new algorithms and lower bound techniques for this problem.

7. How does the direct product theorem play a role in the lower bound proof? Why is it needed to remove the "advice" in the communication problem?

8. The adaptive algorithm and lower bound focus on the regime where memory is O(sqrt(n)). How do you think the tradeoffs would change for larger memory sizes like O(n)?

9. The techniques used seem heavily tailored to the experts setting. Do you think they could extend to broader online learning settings like bandits or online convex optimization?

10. What do you see as the most promising directions for future work based on the techniques developed in this paper? Are there other online learning settings where you think similar analyses could apply?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key contributions of this paper:

This paper studies the fundamental online learning problem where an agent sequentially makes decisions based on the advice of experts, with the goal of minimizing regret. A major open question is whether it is possible to obtain vanishing regret without needing to remember the full history of expert advice. This paper makes progress on this question against both oblivious and adaptive adversaries. For oblivious adversaries, the authors give an algorithm obtaining near-optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{nT/S})$ regret using $S$ memory, resolving the open question posed by prior work. Their algorithm introduces new techniques for maintaining a small pool of useful experts via insensitive merging and pruning. For adaptive adversaries, the authors give the first algorithm obtaining sublinear regret $o(T)$ using sublinear $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ memory. They also prove an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ memory lower bound, showing their algorithm is near-optimal. The algorithm for adaptive adversaries maintains experts at multiple timescales and frequencies to hedge against adaptivity. The lower bound constructively establishes limitations of low-memory algorithms against adaptivity using information-theoretic tools. Together, these results significantly advance our understanding of the memory-regret tradeoff for online learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the fundamental online learning problem with expert advice under memory constraints. The authors give near optimal algorithms and lower bounds for the oblivious and adaptive adversary settings. For the oblivious adversary, they provide an algorithm achieving vanishing regret while using only polylogarithmic memory, nearly matching the lower bound of Woodruff et al (STOC '22). For the adaptive adversary model, they give the first algorithm obtaining sublinear regret with sublinear memory, using roughly $\sqrt{n}$ memory to achieve $o(T)$ regret. They also prove a novel $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ memory lower bound against adaptive adversaries. Their results significantly advance our understanding of the memory-regret tradeoff for online learning. Technically, their algorithm against oblivious adversaries introduces robust pooling and pruning procedures. For the adaptive setting, they incorporate techniques like "monocarpic experts" for handling experts with intermittent lifetimes. The lower bounds build on direct product theorems and information complexity.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new algorithm against an oblivious adversary that achieves near-optimal memory-regret tradeoff. Can you walk through the key ideas and innovations in the algorithm design compared to prior work? How do the eviction rules, epoch division, and filtering help reduce the regret?

2. The paper also gives an algorithm for an adaptive adversary. This seems more challenging since the adversary can react to the algorithm's past actions. What are the key ideas used in the adaptive algorithm, especially the RandomExpert and LongExpert components? How do they work together to handle the adaptivity?

3. The lower bound construction against the adaptive adversary is quite interesting. Can you explain the reduction to a communication problem and how it establishes the necessary memory lower bound? What makes the adaptive adversary strictly harder than the oblivious setting?

4. Both the upper and lower bounds depend in intricate ways on the memory size. Can you walk through the proofs and highlight how the memory constraint is leveraged? What bottlenecks emerge from limited memory?

5. The notion of regret is central in online learning. How does the paper define regret and what benchmark is used? Can you compare it to other notions like second-order regret?

6. The paper makes heavy use of information theoretic tools. Can you explain how mutual information and internal information cost are applied in the proofs? When are direct-product style arguments used?

7. The memory-regret tradeoff achieved is nearly optimal, but can we hope to improve it using structural assumptions on the experts? What kinds of additional structure could help?

8. The paper focuses on full-information feedback. How would the results change in the partial bandit feedback setting? What additional challenges arise there?

9. The techniques used seem quite different from typical approaches in online learning based on weighted majority voting. Can you contrast the approaches and discuss the necessity of new techniques?

10. The paper studies memory bounds in an adversarial setting which differs from stochastic bandits. Can you compare the techniques and discuss how they could inform each other? What differences arise in the stochastic case?
