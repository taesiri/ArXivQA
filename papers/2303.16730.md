# [TTA-COPE: Test-Time Adaptation for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16730)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation without accessing the source domain or labeled target data during test time. The key points are:- The paper proposes a novel method called TTA-COPE (Test-Time Adaptation for Category-Level Object Pose Estimation) to handle domain shifts from source (e.g. synthetic) to target (e.g. real-world) without requiring any labels on the target data. - Previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods for this task still depend on the source domain data during adaptation and do offline batch training. However, TTA-COPE adapts the model sequentially in an online manner without accessing the source data, which is more practical for real applications.- The authors design a pose ensemble approach with self-training loss to effectively generate robust pseudo labels and infer accurate poses during test-time adaptation. This handles the noise and errors inherently present when using pseudo-labels for self-training.- Experiments validate that the proposed method outperforms strong test-time adaptation baselines and achieves state-of-the-art under both semi-supervised and fully unsupervised settings.In summary, the key research question is how to perform online test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation without any target labels or access to the source domain. The paper proposes a novel pose ensemble strategy with self-training loss to address this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation called TTA-COPE. The key ideas are:- TTA-COPE is the first approach to do test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation. It handles domain shifts from source to target without requiring target labels or access to source data at test time.- A pose ensemble method is proposed that utilizes predictions from both a teacher and student model to generate robust pseudo labels for training the student, as well as for estimating accurate poses at inference time. - A self-training loss is designed using the pose ensemble that helps align the target predictions to the observed target point cloud. This reduces the domain gap.- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance compared to strong baselines under semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. The benefits of the pose ensemble and self-training loss are demonstrated through ablation studies.In summary, the main contribution is being the first work to do test-time adaptation for category-level object pose, and proposing the pose ensemble and self-training loss to effectively adapt the model online without target labels or access to source data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a test-time adaptation method for category-level object pose estimation that handles domain shifts without labeling target data and without accessing source data during test time.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research in category-level object pose estimation:- It focuses on test-time adaptation (TTA), adapting a pretrained model to a new target domain without access to source data or target labels. Most prior work has focused on offline unsupervised domain adaptation. TTA is more practical but also more challenging.- The proposed method uses a pose ensemble approach to generate pseudo labels and infer poses. This allows filtering unreliable pseudo labels and making the adaptation process more robust. Other methods have not used pose-specific strategies.- Experiments show state-of-the-art results on the REAL275 dataset compared to other unsupervised methods. The method also outperforms standard TTA baselines like TENT.- Unlike some prior work that requires multiple models (one per category), this method efficiently adapts all categories with a single model.- The proposed self-training loss based on transformed point clouds provides an unsupervised training signal to align the target predictions with the observations. This is a simple but effective strategy.Overall, the key novelty of this work is in formulating and addressing the test-time adaptation problem for category-level pose estimation. The pose ensemble and self-training losses seem to work well, but the main contribution is in identifying this practical problem setting and showing it can effectively adapt to new target domains. This represents an advance over prior offline unsupervised work.
