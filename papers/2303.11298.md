# [Reliability in Semantic Segmentation: Are We on the Right Track?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11298)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract, this paper focuses on assessing the reliability of recent semantic segmentation models in terms of robustness and uncertainty estimation under domain shifts. The key research question seems to be: 

Are state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models improving in terms of robustness and uncertainty estimation under domain shifts?

The authors evaluate a variety of recent segmentation models on natural domain shifts and analyze their performance in terms of robustness (prediction quality out-of-domain), calibration, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. The main goal is to understand if progress on semantic segmentation is also leading to more reliable models that are robust and provide good uncertainty estimates when deployed out-of-domain.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that while segmentation performance is improving steadily in-domain, model reliability in terms of robustness and uncertainty estimation may not be advancing at the same pace, especially under domain shifts. The paper aims to substantiate this claim through a systematic evaluation using metrics like ECE, PRR, and AUROC on natural domain shifts.
