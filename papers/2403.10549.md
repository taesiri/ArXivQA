# [On-Device Domain Learning for Keyword Spotting on Low-Power Extreme Edge   Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10549)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Keyword spotting (KWS) models suffer severe accuracy drops when deployed in noisy environments with noise conditions different from the training data. 
- On-device adaptation is needed to specialize models to the target noise without compromising privacy or increasing communication costs. 
- Existing on-device learning solutions are not suited for extremely resource-constrained edge devices.

Proposed Solution:
- An on-device domain adaptation (ODDA) methodology to specialize pretrained noise-aware KWS models to unseen noise conditions.
- Optimization strategies to make ODDA feasible under tight memory, storage and energy constraints:
   - Enable flexible adaptation depths by partial model freezing.
   - Use only a fraction of available training samples.
- Lightweight implementation validated on an ultra low-power GAP9 microcontroller.  

Main Contributions:
- Achieve up to 14% accuracy gains over robust KWS models in unseen noisy environments.  
- Recover 5% accuracy using only 10kB memory and 100 labeled samples.
- Outperform 17Ã— larger models by 8% through ODDA of a small model. 
- Demonstrate ODDA on GAP9 in 14 sec at 806 mJ, enabling continuous adaptation.

In summary, the paper proposes resource-constrained on-device domain adaptation strategies to effectively specialize noise-aware keyword spotting models to unseen noise conditions at extremely low energy and memory costs compatible with tiny battery-powered devices. Key optimizations and practical ultra low-power implementation demonstrate accuracy recovery with minimal overhead.
