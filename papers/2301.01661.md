# [RecRecNet: Rectangling Rectified Wide-Angle Images by Thin-Plate Spline   Model and DoF-based Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01661)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we rectify wide-angle lens images to correct radial distortion while also keeping the image boundaries rectangular?The key points are:- Existing methods for correcting radial distortion in wide-angle images distort the image boundaries, making them irregularly shaped. - This is problematic because irregular boundaries can degrade performance of downstream computer vision models that expect rectangular image inputs.- The authors propose a new method called RecRecNet that can rectify wide-angle image content while keeping boundaries rectangular.In summary, the main research contribution is developing a technique to achieve distortion correction and boundary rectangling jointly for wide-angle images. The proposed RecRecNet model aims to address the limitations of prior work that focused only on distortion correction at the expense of boundary shape.
