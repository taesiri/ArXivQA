# [RecRecNet: Rectangling Rectified Wide-Angle Images by Thin-Plate Spline   Model and DoF-based Curriculum Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01661)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we rectify wide-angle lens images to correct radial distortion while also keeping the image boundaries rectangular?

The key points are:

- Existing methods for correcting radial distortion in wide-angle images distort the image boundaries, making them irregularly shaped. 

- This is problematic because irregular boundaries can degrade performance of downstream computer vision models that expect rectangular image inputs.

- The authors propose a new method called RecRecNet that can rectify wide-angle image content while keeping boundaries rectangular.

In summary, the main research contribution is developing a technique to achieve distortion correction and boundary rectangling jointly for wide-angle images. The proposed RecRecNet model aims to address the limitations of prior work that focused only on distortion correction at the expense of boundary shape.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a deep learning method called Rectangling Rectification Network (RecRecNet) to produce rectangular rectified images from wide-angle lens images. The key contributions are:

- Proposes RecRecNet to generate rectangular rectified images that have undistorted content and regular boundaries, which is better for downstream vision tasks. This is a new problem that has not been explored before.

- Uses a thin-plate spline (TPS) motion module to flexibly formulate the non-linear rectangling transformation from the rectified image to the rectangular image. 

- Designs a curriculum learning strategy to progressively train the network from simpler transformations to more complex ones, making training faster and more effective.

- Provides analysis on why deformed image boundaries negatively impact vision models, showing it introduces new features that confuse models. 

- Achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results compared to prior rectification and image extrapolation methods. Demonstrates improved performance on object detection and segmentation.

In summary, this paper introduces the task of generating rectangular rectified images and proposes an end-to-end trainable network with TPS motion modeling and curriculum learning to address it effectively. The rectangular images are shown to be better for downstream computer vision tasks.
