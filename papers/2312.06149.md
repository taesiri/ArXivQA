# [Unlocking Anticipatory Text Generation: A Constrained Approach for   Faithful Decoding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06149)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a novel approach for text generation with large language models that aims to minimize undesirable behaviors and enforce faithfulness to instructions. 

Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:

1) Formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem, where the future constraint satisfaction helps guide the generation process towards desired behaviors and alignment with instructions.

2) Estimating the future constraint satisfaction score using large language models by assessing the likelihood of generating the desired output. This score then helps steer the decoding process.

3) Presenting a beam search-based algorithm that recursively generates sequences left-to-right while incorporating the future constraint satisfaction scores at each step.

4) Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three distinct text generation tasks - keyword-constrained generation, toxicity reduction, and factual correctness in question answering. The results exhibit improvements in adhering to specified constraints and guidelines.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel constrained decoding approach for large language models that leverages future constraint satisfaction signals to generate more faithful and controlled outputs. The flexible framework allows specifying verbalized constraints tailored to goals.

The paper proposes formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem to minimize undesirable behaviors of LLMs and enforce faithfulness to instructions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes formalizing text generation as a future-constrained generation problem. Can you elaborate on why this is an effective approach for minimizing undesirable behaviors and enforcing faithfulness to instructions? What are the main benefits?

2. The estimation of future constraint satisfaction is a key aspect of the proposed method. Can you explain in more detail how this estimation is accomplished using large language models (LLMs)? What signals or metrics from the LLMs are leveraged? 

3. The paper utilizes a beam-based search algorithm to solve the optimization problem for text generation. What modifications were made to the standard beam search algorithm and why were they necessary? How does the recursive generation process left-to-right enhance efficiency and efficacy?

4. Three distinct text generation tasks were used to evaluate the method - keyword-constrained generation, toxicity reduction, and factual correctness in QA. Can you analyze the results for each task and discuss where the most significant gains were observed compared to baselines?

5. For the keyword-constrained generation task, the constraint coverage scores were much higher for the proposed method. What explanations are provided in the paper for this? Does the estimation of future lexical constraint satisfaction play a key role?

6. In the analysis section, the decoding time/speed is compared between the proposed approach and baselines like greedy decoding and beam search. What accounts for the slowdown and how can this be mitigated in practice?

7. Could the proposed future-constrained decoding method be applied to other conditional text generation tasks beyond the three investigated in this paper? What kinds of tasks could benefit and why?

8. The constraint satisfaction score is estimated solely based on the likelihood from pretrained LLMs. What are some ways this estimation could be improved with further tuning or modifications to be more accurate? 

9. How does the concept of future constraint satisfaction in this work differ from past approaches that use heuristics to estimate look-ahead scores? What are the advantages of the verbalizable constraints and use of LLMs?

10. The method still relies on a pretrained LLM for text generation. Could the benefits of future constraint satisfaction transfer to other types of generative models besides autoregressive LLMs? What changes would need to be made?
