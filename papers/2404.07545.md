# [Stereo-LiDAR Depth Estimation with Deformable Propagation and Learned   Disparity-Depth Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07545)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate and dense depth estimation from stereo cameras and LiDAR is an important task for autonomous driving and robotics. Stereo matching can produce dense depth maps but struggles in challenging scenarios like textureless regions. Incorporating sparse LiDAR depth can improve stereo matching, but the sparsity and non-uniformity of LiDAR depth limits its effectiveness. Another issue is that recovering accurate depth from disparity is difficult, especially at longer distances, due to triangulation errors that grow quadratically with distance.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel stereo-LiDAR depth estimation network called SDG-Depth, which addresses the above issues. It includes:

1) A deformable propagation module that expands the sparse LiDAR depth into a semi-dense depth map and confidence map. This helps provide guidance across occlusion and depth discontinuities. 

2) A confidence-based Gaussian module that modulates the stereo cost volume using the semi-dense depth and confidence to improve aggregation.

3) A disparity-depth conversion module that predicts residual adjustments in both disparity and depth spaces. This mitigates triangulation errors and enables more accurate depth recovery.

Main Contributions:

- A stereo-LiDAR fusion network that sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks for accuracy and speed on multiple datasets like KITTI, Virtual KITTI2 and MS2.

- A deformable propagation module that effectively expands sparse depth hints across occlusions and boundaries by propagating within learned deformable windows.

- A lightweight disparity-depth conversion module that enables precise depth recovery from disparity predictions while being computationally efficient.

The method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art techniques, producing more accurate depth maps while retaining high computational efficiency. Key advantages are in distant regions and at object boundaries.
