# [Clash of the Explainers: Argumentation for Context-Appropriate   Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07635)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Selecting the most appropriate XAI technique for a given context is challenging. There is no single best approach and different stakeholders have diverse needs. 
- Current XAI methods mostly serve system developers and make assumptions about users' expertise to interpret explanations.
- More transparency is needed into why a particular explanation technique was selected.

Proposed Solution:
- A modular reasoning system to select the most context-appropriate XAI technique consisting of:
  - Stakeholder mental model component: Represents relevant knowledge about stakeholder values, requirements, etc.  
  - Multi-explainer component: Contains multiple XAI techniques, each with characteristics that support different user needs.
  - Reasoner component: Uses computational argumentation to reason over explainers and select the one best suited to the stakeholder mental model and context. Includes a knowledge base and argumentation solver.
  - ML system component: The model requiring explanation (can be any dataset and ML model).

- Formalizes characteristics of explainers and stakeholder needs to create a knowledge base that the argumentation solver uses to prioritize the best explainer for the context.
- Offers transparency into explainer selection by making all reasoning steps and assumptions explicit.

Main Contributions:
- A framework to formally represent:
  - Characteristics of XAI techniques
  - How these characteristics map to stakeholder needs
  - Contexts in which explanations will be used
- Enables transparent, context-appropriate selection from existing XAI methods 
- Reasoning component accounts for biases and designer assumptions through argumentation
- Selection transparency further shapes stakeholder's understanding of system & explanation dependency  

In summary, the paper proposes a modular system to transparently select the most suitable XAI technique given a representation of the stakeholder and context. Formal argumentation over explainer characteristics and stakeholder needs facilitates context-appropriate explanation generation.
