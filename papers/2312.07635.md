# [Clash of the Explainers: Argumentation for Context-Appropriate   Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07635)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Selecting the most appropriate XAI technique for a given context is challenging. There is no single best approach and different stakeholders have diverse needs. 
- Current XAI methods mostly serve system developers and make assumptions about users' expertise to interpret explanations.
- More transparency is needed into why a particular explanation technique was selected.

Proposed Solution:
- A modular reasoning system to select the most context-appropriate XAI technique consisting of:
  - Stakeholder mental model component: Represents relevant knowledge about stakeholder values, requirements, etc.  
  - Multi-explainer component: Contains multiple XAI techniques, each with characteristics that support different user needs.
  - Reasoner component: Uses computational argumentation to reason over explainers and select the one best suited to the stakeholder mental model and context. Includes a knowledge base and argumentation solver.
  - ML system component: The model requiring explanation (can be any dataset and ML model).

- Formalizes characteristics of explainers and stakeholder needs to create a knowledge base that the argumentation solver uses to prioritize the best explainer for the context.
- Offers transparency into explainer selection by making all reasoning steps and assumptions explicit.

Main Contributions:
- A framework to formally represent:
  - Characteristics of XAI techniques
  - How these characteristics map to stakeholder needs
  - Contexts in which explanations will be used
- Enables transparent, context-appropriate selection from existing XAI methods 
- Reasoning component accounts for biases and designer assumptions through argumentation
- Selection transparency further shapes stakeholder's understanding of system & explanation dependency  

In summary, the paper proposes a modular system to transparently select the most suitable XAI technique given a representation of the stakeholder and context. Formal argumentation over explainer characteristics and stakeholder needs facilitates context-appropriate explanation generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modular system comprising a reasoner over multiple explainers to select the most appropriate explanation technique given the context, which includes a representation of the stakeholder's needs and the characteristics of the available explanation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

A framework for the formalisation of and reasoning over: 
i) the characteristics of explanation techniques; 
ii) the properties that make them well-suited or ill-suited towards various contexts; and  
iii) the contexts in which the produced explanations are to be used. 

With such a formalization, the paper argues that transparency into the selection of existing explainer methods that also maps needs to their capabilities is afforded. This is proposed through the introduction of a reasoning component on top of a multi-explainer system. The goal is to take an appropriate mental model of a target explainee into account when offering explanations, without assuming that the user has full expertise to interpret the output of each explanation method.

In summary, the main contribution is a modular reasoning system to select context-appropriate explainers based on formalized knowledge about explainers, contexts, and explainee needs. This aims to provide transparency into the explainer selection process.

The paper proposes a modular reasoning system consisting of components like a mental model, a reasoner, a multi-explainer system, and a machine learning model to select the most appropriate explainer for generating explanations based on the context. It utilizes argumentation and reasoning over facts, beliefs, values, and preferences to map stakeholder needs to explainer capabilities and choose the optimal one. The goal is to provide transparency into the selection process through exposing the assumptions and inferences. Key terms like XAI, HCXAI, argumentation, reasoning, mental models, and context-appropriateness capture the essence.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a modular reasoning system consisting of four key components: the mental model, the reasoner, the multi-explainer, and the ML system. Can you elaborate on how these different components interact with each other to select the most appropriate explainer? What are the inputs and outputs?

2. The reasoner component contains both a knowledge base and an argumentation solver. What types of facts and rules are contained in the knowledge base? And what argumentation framework and semantics are used by the solver? 

3. The multi-explainer component can contain multiple explanation techniques. Can the same technique be included multiple times but with different parameters? What is the benefit of having multiple instances of the same explainer?

4. The paper states that the ML system component should contain metadata and the trained model. What types of metadata would be relevant to include? And why access to the training data important for some explanation techniques?

5. One unique aspect proposed is the continuous updates to the mental model based on interactions with the system. How can neurosymbolic AI help extract symbolic knowledge from natural language conversations to update the mental model?

6. The paper focuses on selecting the most appropriate single explainer, while mentioning aggregated explanations as future work. What are some challenges or ethical issues that could arise from explainers generating conflicting or incompatible explanations?  

7. Since argumentation frameworks can reflect the biases of system designers, how does transparency into the reasoning process help mitigate issues around "ethics washing"? What opportunities exist for contestability?

8. What are some real-world use cases where a modular explanation system architecture would be valuable? What types of stakeholder interactions could it support?

9. The paper proposes an interactive system with user feedback, but evaluation through human subject studies is still needed. What key research questions should the user study aim to address? And what metrics determine success?

10. If the argumentation solver returns no accepted arguments, the system defaults to a trivial explanation. Could there be scenarios where providing no explanation is preferable to providing a misleading one? How to balance transparency and ethics here?
