# [Measurement in the Age of LLMs: An Application to Ideological Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09203)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-quality paragraph summarizing the main points of the paper:

This paper explores the potential for using large language models (LLMs) to measure complex social science constructs like political ideology. It showcases an approach called "direct elicitation" whereby an LLM like GPT-3.5 is prompted to directly furnish ideological scores for legislators and tweets rather than relying on traditional modeling of roll-call votes or word counts. Remarkably, the ideologies the LLM assigns to senators correlate highly with those from well-established methods. The flexibility of direct elicitation is demonstrated through additional experiments that have the LLM detect subtle ideological signals in constructed tweets and character vignettes. By handling inherent ambiguities and requiring holistic synthesis of information, the direct elicitation approach suggests LLMs can help study such slippery constructs while avoiding prematurely ripping them from their natural linguistic habitat into the numeric realm. The results overall support LLMs as promising tools for social scientific measurement that complement both qualitative linguistic analysis and quantitative statistical modeling.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Social science concepts like "ideology" are difficult to precisely define and measure due to their linguistic nature and dependence on context. Traditional quantitative approaches have tried to "rip" these concepts from their linguistic habitat by focusing only on quantified behaviors, at the cost of meaning. Meanwhile qualitative methods embrace the linguistic aspect but don't scale. Large language models (LLMs) open a third potential path by leveraging neural networks' linguistic fluency. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose directly eliciting ideological scores and judgements from LLMs through natural language conversations. They converse with models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to rate politicians, tweets, scenarios, and other text on numerical left/right ideological scales. The flexibility of conversational prompting allows tailoring to different tasks. Self-anchoring, order randomization, scale normalization, and elaboration help address concerns around LLM limitations.

Main Contributions:
- Show LLMs can directly rate legislators' ideological positions highly consistent with scales from votes, donations, speeches 
- Demonstrate flexibility to adapt this approach many ways, rating tweet ideology subtly and precisely
- Trace Trump's ideological tweeting showing spike after 2011 event, corroborating political lore 
- Detect ideological signals in complex dinner conversation vignettes
- Classify and scale Senators' tweets consistently with their name-only scores
- Identify tradeoffs between reliability and flexibility vs a complementary pairwise rating approach

The authors argue this methodology allows studying ideological concepts in their natural habitat at scale, mitigating lingual ambiguities through elaboration while avoiding premature quantification. The flexibility and strong results support the promise of leveraging neural language fluency for social science measurement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores using large language models to directly elicit ideological scores for legislators and text, finding they can measure subtle manifestations of ideology and exhibit consistency across different elicitation strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to directly elicit ideological scores and scales from text. The main contributions are:

- Showcasing a variety of ways that LLMs can be prompted to flexibly measure ideological content in text. This includes eliciting ideal points for legislators, detecting ideological content in tweets, identifying dog whistles, and interpreting political leanings from subtle cues in contrived scenarios.

- Demonstrating that the ideological scores and scales elicited by the LLM exhibit validity when compared to established methods or when examined for meaningful patterns over time. This suggests LLMs are capable of sophisticated ideological measurement.

- Proposing that the linguistic fluency of LLMs allows social scientists to study complex political constructs with both the scalability of quantitative methods and the richness of qualitative methods. LLMs open a third front distinct from the traditional qualitative vs quantitative divide.

- Highlighting strategies to mitigate issues with eliciting subjective judgements from LLMs, like using dynamic self-anchoring, encouraging chain of thought explanations, and marginalizing over variations in the prompt.

So in summary, the main contribution is showcasing the potential for LLMs to measure ideological content and constructs directly through natural language conversations, in a way that is flexible, valid, and bridges qualitative and quantitative methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that LLMs allow social scientists to study complex constructs without prematurely ripping them from their "natural linguistic habitat." However, how can we ensure that the linguistic representations learned by LLMs genuinely reflect the constructs of interest, rather than spurious correlations in the training data?

2. When eliciting scores directly, what strategies can be used to promote consistency and mitigate against sensitivity to small prompt variations? Should prompts be standardized similarly to survey instruments? 

3. The paper relies on notions of face, construct, and criterion validity. However, what other validity evidence is needed to establish the validity of LLM-based measurements as a general approach?

4. The paper examines the internal consistency between elicited ideal points and tweet scores. But what other tests of reliability are needed to establish the reliability of measurements elicited from stochastic language models? 

5. The paper examines ideological content, but how might this approach extend to other latent attributes like personality traits? What challenges might arise when attempting to scale less tangible constructs?  

6. The paper relies heavily on the autoregressive and few-shot capabilities of LLMs. How might capabilities like retrieval and reasoning more explicitly support the measurement process in ways that autoregression cannot?

7. The paper examines the U.S. Senate, but how well might this approach work in other cultural contexts where ideological spectrums may be defined very differently? How can cultural specificity be accounted for?

8. The paper argues LLMs mitigate the need for quantification. But are there ways that traditional quantified data could complement LLM-based measurements to arrive at an even richer understanding? 

9. The paper examines sensitivity to minor prompt changes as an issue, but are there potentially ways to take advantage of, rather than mitigate, an LLM's sensitivity to subtle linguistic cues?

10. The paper introduces direct elicitation as an approach complementary to pairwise elicitation. How might these two approaches be combined? Could the reliability of pairwise judgements improve direct elicitation?
