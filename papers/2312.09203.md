# [Measurement in the Age of LLMs: An Application to Ideological Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09203)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a potential high-quality paragraph summarizing the main points of the paper:

This paper explores the potential for using large language models (LLMs) to measure complex social science constructs like political ideology. It showcases an approach called "direct elicitation" whereby an LLM like GPT-3.5 is prompted to directly furnish ideological scores for legislators and tweets rather than relying on traditional modeling of roll-call votes or word counts. Remarkably, the ideologies the LLM assigns to senators correlate highly with those from well-established methods. The flexibility of direct elicitation is demonstrated through additional experiments that have the LLM detect subtle ideological signals in constructed tweets and character vignettes. By handling inherent ambiguities and requiring holistic synthesis of information, the direct elicitation approach suggests LLMs can help study such slippery constructs while avoiding prematurely ripping them from their natural linguistic habitat into the numeric realm. The results overall support LLMs as promising tools for social scientific measurement that complement both qualitative linguistic analysis and quantitative statistical modeling.
