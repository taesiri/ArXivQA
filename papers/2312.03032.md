## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most learning-based point cloud registration methods require extensive training on large datasets, limiting their applicability. Traditional methods using handcrafted features do not require training but struggle with performance. This paper aims to develop a point cloud registration approach that does not require training on 3D point cloud datasets while achieving better performance than traditional methods.

Proposed Solution - ZeroReg:
The paper proposes ZeroReg, the first zero-shot learning method for point cloud registration that eliminates the need for training on point cloud datasets. The key ideas are:

1) Extract reliable keypoints from 2D RGB image pairs using an off-the-shelf method (SuperPoint). Project these keypoints onto the corresponding 3D point clouds to establish 2D-3D correspondences.

2) Use a pretrained 2D backbone (ResUNet-50) to extract pixel-level features and transfer them to 3D points. 

3) Propose a novel parameter-free geometric decoder to integrate geometric information from the 3D structure into the 2D visual features. This enhances feature distinctiveness.

4) Establish coarse correspondences between keypoints using optimal transport. Expand keypoints into patches using nearest neighbors. Compute fine-level correspondences using patched descriptors.

5) Estimate final transformation with RANSAC using the obtained correspondences.

Main Contributions:

1) First zero-shot learning approach for point cloud registration that eliminates training on 3D data.

2) Novel integration of 2D visual features and 3D geometry using a parameter-free decoder to refine descriptors.

3) Extensive experiments showing ZeroReg outperforms traditional methods and competes with supervised learning methods. For example, on 3DMatch dataset, ZeroReg achieves 84.4% registration recall compared to 75.5% for the best traditional method.

In summary, ZeroReg pioneers a new direction for point cloud registration without requiring training on 3D data, enabling better generalization. The novel fusion of 2D and 3D information also improves performance over traditional methods.
