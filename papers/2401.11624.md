# [In-context Learning with Retrieved Demonstrations for Language Models: A   Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "In-context Learning with Retrieved Demonstrations for Language Models: A Survey":

Problem:
- In-context learning (ICL) allows language models to adapt to new tasks using just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, model performance is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations. 
- Using a fixed, context-insensitive set of demonstrations for all queries can limit unlocking the full potential of language models.

Proposed Solution: 
- Retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query instead of using the same examples for all queries. This is called retrieval-based ICL (RetICL).

Key Aspects of RetICL:
- Retrieval Objectives: Maximize similarity and/or diversity of retrieved demonstrations.
- Retrieval Models: Off-the-shelf models (BM25, SBERT) or custom models trained using signals from language models.  
- Retrieval Corpus: In-domain training data, cross-domain data, unlabeled queries with LLM-generated answers.
- Retrieval Strategies: One-shot retrieval, iterative retrieval, clustering-based retrieval.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of 22 papers on RetICL, outlining design choices for key components. 
- Identified areas where RetICL surpasses previous ICL methods, especially reduced sensitivity to demonstration order/formatting.
- Review of applications showing improvements on NLU, reasoning, QA, and text generation tasks.
- Discussed limitations of current approaches and provided insights into promising future research directions.

In summary, the paper provides a thorough overview of existing literature on using demonstration retrieval to enhance in-context learning for language models and highlights open challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this survey paper on in-context learning with retrieved demonstrations:

1. The paper discusses various retrieval objectives like similarity and diversity. How do you determine which objective is most suitable for a given task? What are some heuristics to decide this?

2. When using an iterative retrieval strategy, how do you determine the criteria for updating the query representation at each step? What impact does this choice of update criteria have on demonstration quality? 

3. What are some advanced clustering techniques beyond k-means that can be used for demonstration retrieval to improve cluster quality? How can we evaluate if better clusters lead to better demonstrations?

4. The paper talks about using scoring LLMs to provide signals for training demonstration retrievers. What is a good strategy to select the optimal scoring LLM for a task given constraints on model size and computational budgets?

5. When using self-consistency of LLM predictions to filter demonstrations, what thresholds should be used for agreement rates to qualify an example as a good demonstration? How sensitive is model performance to this threshold value?

6. For text generation tasks like data-to-text, how should demonstration relevance be defined - is it based primarily on input similarity or expected output similarity or both? What impact does this choice have?

7. How can active learning principles and criteria be integrated with retrieval to progressively expand demonstration pools over time as new queries come in?

8. What theoretical insights can explain why similar demonstrations are more useful for in-context learning compared to random demonstrations? Are there any counter-examples?  

9. How should the evaluation metrics and processes be designed to effectively compare different demonstration retriever architectures and objective functions? What are the limitations of current practices?

10. How do optimal demonstration retrieval strategies differ between small versus large language models? What modifications need to be made to scale retrieval techniques from small to large models?
