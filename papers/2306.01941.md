# [AI Transparency in the Age of LLMs: A Human-Centered Research Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01941)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to be making a single central claim or testing a specific hypothesis. Rather, it seems to be more of a perspective/opinion piece that lays out a roadmap and open questions for future research on transparency approaches for large language models (LLMs). 

Some of the key points and themes I picked up are:

- LLMs introduce unique challenges for transparency (e.g. complex capabilities, massive scale, proprietary nature) compared to past AI systems that transparency research has focused on.

- There are lessons learned from past human-centered AI and HCI research on transparency that are relevant, like taking a goal-oriented perspective, supporting appropriate trust, and considering people's mental models.

- Existing transparency approaches like model reporting, evaluation, explanations, and uncertainty communication can serve as a starting point but may need to be rethought for LLMs. The paper discusses open questions around how to adapt these approaches.

- Overall, there is a need for more research taking a human-centered approach to transparency for LLMs, considering the needs of diverse new stakeholders and usage contexts. The paper aims to lay out a roadmap for this research.

So in summary, I would say the paper is intended to synthesize past work, articulate the new challenges introduced by LLMs, and outline open questions and opportunities to guide future human-centered research on transparency for LLMs. It does not make a single central claim.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper lays out a human-centered research roadmap for transparency approaches to support responsible development and use of large language models, reflecting on the unique challenges posed by LLMs, lessons from prior HCI/FATE research, and open questions around applying common transparency techniques like model reporting, evaluation, explanation, and uncertainty communication.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on AI transparency:

- It takes a human-centered perspective on transparency, focusing on the needs of diverse stakeholders and how they process and interact with transparency information. Much prior work focuses more narrowly on developing technical approaches without considering human factors.

- It provides a comprehensive overview across transparency techniques like model reporting, evaluation, explanations, and uncertainty communication. Many papers focus on just one technique in isolation. 

- It explores open questions and future directions for transparency research specifically for large language models (LLMs). Most existing work predates the rise of LLMs or focuses on other types of models.

- It synthesizes lessons from the HCI and FATE literature on human mental models, appropriate trust, control, and effective communication. Many technical papers do not connect to this related work.

- It considers transparency needs across the LLM ecosystem, including base models, adapted models, and LLM-powered applications. Most work looks at transparency for isolated models.

- It takes a critical perspective, considering challenges like proprietary models and organizational incentives that may limit transparency. Much work presumes unfettered access to models.

Overall, this paper provides a broad, human-centered perspective on transparency for LLMs, synthesizing a wide range of prior work. It lays out a research agenda considering the unique aspects of LLMs and connects technical approaches to human needs and impact. This provides useful guidance for the field at a critical juncture as LLMs become more widespread.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions in the paper:

- Investigating the new transparency goals that arise for stakeholders interacting with LLMs, such as supporting ideation, model adaptation, prompting, and discovering risky model behaviors. 

- Studying which approaches to transparency can best help people develop appropriate levels of trust in LLMs. This includes conceptualizing and measuring trust, and empirically evaluating the impact of different transparency approaches.

- Exploring how transparency approaches can contribute to better control mechanisms for LLMs, enabling stakeholders to steer LLM behavior.

- Unpacking people's mental models of LLMs and supporting the formation of more accurate and complete mental models through transparency.

- Distilling principles for effectively communicating necessary information about LLMs during natural language interactions.

- Developing new evaluation techniques and communication patterns to evaluate LLMs in a transparent manner, considering their unpredictable capabilities.

- Pursuing more faithful explanations for LLMs, potentially by articulating different types of explanations and their uses.

- Defining useful notions of uncertainty for LLMs based on human needs and studying effective ways to communicate uncertainty.

- Considering transparency around temporal changes in LLMs and their downstream effects.

- Exploring the role of external auditors, regulators, and the general public in achieving transparency for LLMs.

The authors highlight the need for a human-centered perspective on LLM transparency and encourage research attending to the technology, stakeholders, and broader socio-organizational context.
