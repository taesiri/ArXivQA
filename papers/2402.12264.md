# [Uncertainty quantification in fine-tuned LLMs using LoRA ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can improve performance on specialized tasks, but there is limited understanding of what knowledge is retained, forgotten or gained during fine-tuning. 
- Quantifying the uncertainty in the predictions of fine-tuned LLMs is important for their reliable and informed application.

Proposed Solution: 
- Derive principled uncertainty quantification for fine-tuned LLMs using posterior approximations with computationally efficient Bayesian ensembles of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) members.
- Analyze common multiple-choice QA datasets using LoRA ensembles and entropic uncertainty measures (predictive entropy and mutual information) to draw conclusions about dataset complexity, out-of-distribution behavior and model efficacy.

Key Contributions:
- Provided a Bayesian interpretation of fine-tuning LLMs, early stopping and conditional generative tasks.
- Introduced a method to derive posterior approximations for fine-tuned LLMs using ensembles of LoRA members. 
- Demonstrated how analysis of the evolution of entropic uncertainty measures can provide insights into dataset complexity, out-of-distribution samples and limitations of model architecture.
- Analyzed multiple choice QA datasets (CQA, MMLU STEM, MMLU Social Sciences) using LoRA ensembles derived from Mistral-7b model. Drew quantitative conclusions about their relative complexity and efficacy of fine-tuning.

In summary, the paper introduces a principled Bayesian method using LoRA ensembles to quantify uncertainty in fine-tuned LLMs and shows how analysis of entropic measures can provide valuable insights into the fine-tuning process across different datasets.
