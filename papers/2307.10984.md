# [Metric3D: Towards Zero-shot Metric 3D Prediction from A Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10984)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we learn a zero-shot, single view, metric depth model that can generalize to unseen cameras and scenes?

The key points are:

- Existing monocular depth estimation methods either learn metric depth specific to a dataset/camera model, or learn affine-invariant depth that lacks metric information. 

- The paper aims to learn a model that can estimate metric depth in a zero-shot manner, generalizing to new scenes and camera models not seen during training.

- To achieve this, the paper proposes:

1) A canonical camera space transformation to resolve metric ambiguity issues from different cameras during training. 

2) Training with a large and diverse dataset of 8M images from 11 datasets covering different scenes and 10K+ camera models.

3) A random proposal normalization loss to improve depth accuracy.

4) Evaluating on multiple unseen datasets to demonstrate zero-shot generalization ability.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that through the proposed canonical camera space transformation and large-scale diverse training, the model can learn to estimate metric depth in a zero-shot manner for new scenes and camera models. The experiments aim to demonstrate this generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a canonical camera space transformation method to solve the metric depth ambiguity caused by varying camera parameters during training. This enables learning a robust metric depth model from large-scale mixed training data. 

2. It introduces a random proposal normalization loss to further improve depth accuracy by emphasizing local contrasts.

3. The trained metric depth model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 zero-shot benchmarks and enables high-quality metric 3D reconstruction from single images. 

4. The predicted metric depths can benefit downstream applications like monocular SLAM by reducing scale drift.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing solutions to train a single view metric depth model from large diverse data that generalizes zero-shot across scenes and camera models. This enables accurate metric 3D reconstruction from single images in the wild. The predicted metric depths also improve downstream tasks like SLAM.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes a canonical camera space transformation method to enable training monocular depth estimation models on large-scale mixed datasets with many different camera models, allowing the models to achieve robust zero-shot metric depth prediction on new scenes and camera models not seen during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for learning a zero-shot, single view, metric depth estimation model from monocular images. Here are some key comparisons to other related works:

- Most prior works on monocular depth estimation focus on either metric depth trained on a single dataset/camera model, or affine-invariant depth trained on mixed datasets. This paper proposes a method to learn a metric depth model from large-scale mixed training data, achieving both generalization and metric accuracy.

- Compared to metric depth methods like Adabins and NeWCRFs, this paper's model shows better generalization to unseen datasets/cameras without finetuning. It also demonstrates robustness on a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes.

- Compared to affine-invariant methods like MiDaS and LeReS, this model can recover metric 3D structure rather than up to an unknown scale. This enables metrology applications and improves downstream tasks like SLAM.

- The proposed canonical camera space transformation is a simple yet effective way to handle varying cameras in mixed training. It avoids directly encoding camera models like CamConv.

- The random proposal normalization loss improves over standard losses by emphasizing local scale-invariant geometry.

- By training on a large 8M image dataset, this model achieves state-of-the-art performance on depth generalization benchmarks, outperforming recent methods like HDN and DPT.

- The experiments demonstrate practical applications like SLAM improvement and in-the-wild metrology that benefit from the learned metric depths.

Overall, the key novelty is the ability to learn a single image metric depth model with strong generalization. This is enabled by the canonical space training strategy and large-scale data. The experiments show accurate metric 3D reconstruction on diverse real images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing better methods to solve the metric ambiguity issues in monocular depth estimation when training on diverse camera models. The authors propose a canonical camera space transformation, but suggest this could be further improved. 

- Exploring different network architectures and self-supervised methods to take advantage of the large-scale mixed training data. The authors show improved results by using ConvNeXt, but there may be room for bigger gains.

- Applying the metric depth prediction model to more downstream tasks beyond SLAM and 3D reconstruction. For example, using it for occlusion-aware profscene completion, novel view synthesis, etc.

- Improving the speed and efficiency of the model to make it more practical for real-time applications like autonomous vehicles. The current model involves resizing images which is computationally expensive.

- Testing the generalization abilities on an even more diverse set of internet images captured completely in the wild. The Flickr images used for metrology were still somewhat constrained.

- Developing techniques to estimate camera intrinsics directly from the images themselves, rather than relying on metadata. This could expand applicability.

- Exploring the use of predicted metric depths as extra training signal for multi-view stereo and SLAM systems to improve their performance. 

- Applying the method to video inputs for temporally consistent metric depth estimation.

So in summary, the main directions are improving the camera invariance, scaling up with more advanced networks and data, testing on more challenging wild image sets, and integrating the metric depths to benefit various applications.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to learn a zero-shot, single view, metric depth model from a single image. The key ideas are using a canonical camera space transformation during training to resolve ambiguity issues from varying camera models, and training on a large and diverse dataset of 8 million images to achieve strong generalization. 

The canonical camera space transforms all training images to appear as if captured by the same camera model. This is done by either rescaling the input images or the ground truth depth labels. The transformation resolves supervision and appearance conflicts caused by different camera intrinsics. After this transformation, the model is trained on a large 11-dataset training set covering diverse indoor and outdoor scenes and thousands of camera models. The model learns to implicitly understand camera models and bridge image appearance to real-world scale. At inference, a de-canonical transformation recovers the original metric scale. Further improvements come from a proposed random proposal normalization loss to enhance local depth contrasts. Evaluations show state-of-the-art performance on 7 zero-shot benchmarks. The method enables accurate metric 3D reconstruction from internet images. It also improves monocular SLAM systems by resolving scale drift.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a canonical camera space transformation module to enable learning of a single image metric depth model from large-scale diverse datasets with thousands of camera models. The key idea is to transform all training data into a canonical camera space where images can be regarded as captured by the same camera. Two transformation methods are proposed - transforming the input images to simulate the canonical camera's imaging effect, or transforming the ground truth depth labels for supervision. After this transformation, standard depth estimation models can be trained on the large mixed dataset. To further improve accuracy, a random proposal normalization loss is used to enhance local contrast. For inference, a reverse de-canonical transformation is done to recover metric information. By training with 8 million images from 11 diverse datasets, the method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and enables metric 3D recovery from images in the wild. Applications like monocular SLAM and metrology are also demonstrated.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of learning to predict metric depth from a single image in a way that can generalize to new datasets with different cameras. Two main issues it tries to tackle are: 

1) Current monocular depth estimation methods rely on being trained and tested on data from the same camera, so they don't generalize well to new datasets. 

2) Recent methods that train on large diverse datasets can generalize well but only predict depth up to an unknown scale, not in absolute metric units.

The key questions the paper tries to answer are:

- How can a model be trained on diverse datasets with different cameras while still being able to predict metric depth?

- How can a monocular depth model generalize to new scenes and camera types without needing to finetune or adapt the scale?

The main contributions are proposing methods to resolve the ambiguity from different camera intrinsics during training, as well as losses and training procedures to enable strong generalization. The end result is a single monocular depth model that can predict metric depth accurately in the wild across different datasets.
