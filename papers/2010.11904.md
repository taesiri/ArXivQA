# [Transcription Is All You Need: Learning to Separate Musical Mixtures   with Score as Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11904)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether musical scores alone can be used as a weak label to train a music source separation system without access to isolated stems. The key hypothesis is that by using a musical score as a training target, the model can learn to separate mixtures into individual instrument sources, even though it only has access to the mixed signal and score during training, not isolated tracks.Some key points:- Most prior work on score-informed source separation uses isolated tracks during training. This work explores only using mixtures and scores.- The proposed model uses a transcriptor as a critic to guide learning of a separator. The separator tries to separate the mixture so the transcriptor can predict the correct score from each estimated source. - Harmonic mask constraints and adversarial losses are introduced to further improve separation and transcription performance when training with weak score labels.So in summary, the main research question is whether score alone provides enough information to train a source separation system without isolated stems, which they test through their proposed transcriptor-separator model trained on mixtures and scores.
