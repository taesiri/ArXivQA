# [Transcription Is All You Need: Learning to Separate Musical Mixtures   with Score as Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11904)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether musical scores alone can be used as a weak label to train a music source separation system without access to isolated stems. The key hypothesis is that by using a musical score as a training target, the model can learn to separate mixtures into individual instrument sources, even though it only has access to the mixed signal and score during training, not isolated tracks.Some key points:- Most prior work on score-informed source separation uses isolated tracks during training. This work explores only using mixtures and scores.- The proposed model uses a transcriptor as a critic to guide learning of a separator. The separator tries to separate the mixture so the transcriptor can predict the correct score from each estimated source. - Harmonic mask constraints and adversarial losses are introduced to further improve separation and transcription performance when training with weak score labels.So in summary, the main research question is whether score alone provides enough information to train a source separation system without isolated stems, which they test through their proposed transcriptor-separator model trained on mixtures and scores.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel weakly-supervised training approach for music source separation that only requires a music mixture and its musical score during training. The key ideas are:- Using a musical score as a weak label to train a source separation system, instead of requiring isolated music stems. - A 3-step training strategy involving:   1) Pre-training a "transcriptor" on mixtures and scores   2) Using the transcriptor to supervise training of a "separator"   3) Jointly fine-tuning the transcriptor and separator with adversarial losses- Introducing harmonic mask constraints derived from the score to improve separation of harmonic instruments.- Novel adversarial losses during joint training to improve the transcriptor's sensitivity to errors in the separated outputs.The proposed approach achieves competitive separation performance without needing isolated training data, only requiring widely available musical scores and mixtures during training. The use of musical scores provides both temporal and harmonic supervision, outperforming methods relying only on temporal activity labels.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in music source separation and weakly supervised learning:- Most prior work in music source separation relies on supervised training with isolated source tracks. This paper proposes a novel approach to train a separation model using only mixtures and musical scores.- Other weakly supervised separation methods use sound event class labels or visual information as weak supervision. This paper is unique in using musical scores, which provide both temporal and harmonic supervision.- The proposed three-step training strategy builds on prior work like Pishdadian et al. that used a classifier for weak supervision. But this paper argues musical scores can provide better supervision for separating harmonic instruments.- The adversarial losses proposed for fine-tuning are novel compared to prior score-informed separation work, and help improve separation and transcription.- Results demonstrate their proposed method outperforms a classifier-based baseline, but still lags supervised training. Most prior score-informed methods still require isolated tracks.- This paper focuses on separating a few harmonic instruments. Extending the approach to drums or larger ensembles could be interesting future work.In summary, this paper makes innovative contributions in leveraging musical scores for weakly supervised separation, outperforming prior work that relied only on temporal supervision. The adversarial training strategies are also novel for this problem domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Tackling the alignment problem between audio and musical scores in order to expand the range of training data that can be used. The current method assumes the audio and scores are already well-aligned, but the authors suggest incorporating alignment algorithms as a pre-processing step. - Separating non-harmonic instruments like drums within their proposed framework. The current experiments focus on harmonic instruments like piano, guitar and bass.- Exploring semi-supervised approaches that combine small amounts of fully-supervised training data (with isolated sources) along with large amounts of weakly labeled data (mixtures + scores only).- Improving the adversarial training strategies, for example by using more advanced GAN techniques. - Testing the approach on real (non-synthesized) music datasets to evaluate how well it generalizes.- Incorporating score information at test time as well as training time to further improve separation performance.- Comparing to and combining with other weakly supervised separation techniques like using other types of weak labels (class labels, video, etc).In summary, the main directions are improving the training data and alignment, expanding the range of instruments, exploring semi-supervised and adversarial training, and evaluating on real-world datasets. The authors lay out promising future work to make their score-supervised separation approach more practical and better performing.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a novel weakly-supervised approach to train a music source separation system using only mixtures and their corresponding musical scores, without needing isolated instrument tracks. The model consists of a separator that outputs time-frequency masks for each instrument, and a transcriptor that acts as a critic to guide the separator's training. The transcriptor provides both temporal and frequency supervision derived from the score. A harmonic mask constraint is introduced to further leverage score information. Two adversarial losses are proposed to fine-tune the transcriptor and separator. Experiments on the Slakh2100 dataset demonstrate that using score supervision outperforms using only temporal activity labels. The adversarial training strategies lead to additional improvements in separation and transcription performance compared to training the components in isolation. The results show the potential of scores as a weak label for training source separation systems without access to isolated instrument tracks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method for training a music source separation system using only mixtures of music and their corresponding musical scores, without needing isolated tracks. The model contains two components - a separator that outputs time-frequency masks to separate each instrument, and a transcriptor that acts as a critic to provide supervision. The transcriptor is first pre-trained to transcribe mixtures to scores. The pretrained transcriptor is then fixed and used to guide training of the separator, by updating the separator so its separated outputs can be correctly transcribed. Two novel loss functions are introduced during separator training to incorporate score information - a clip level mixture loss using activity from the score, and a harmonic mixture loss utilizing harmonic masks derived from the score. Finally, the transcriptor and separator are jointly trained with two new adversarial losses that encourage the transcriptor to be more sensitive to errors in the separated tracks. Experiments on the Slakh2100 dataset show this approach outperforms a baseline using only a classifier for supervision. The proposed harmonic loss and adversarial losses are shown to further improve separation and transcription performance compared to just using the transcriptor outputs as training targets.In summary, this work demonstrates a music source separation system can be trained using only mixtures and scores as training data, without needing isolated tracks. The proposed method of using a pretrained transcriptor as a critic, along with harmonic and adversarial losses, is able to effectively leverage the weak labels provided by musical scores. Results approach those obtained with isolated tracks, demonstrating the feasibility of score-supervised separation.
