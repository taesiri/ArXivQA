# [Supersizing Self-supervision: Learning to Grasp from 50K Tries and 700   Robot Hours](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether it is possible to scale up trial-and-error experiments to collect large datasets for training high-capacity deep learning models, like CNNs, to predict grasp locations for novel objects. The key hypotheses are:1) Large-scale datasets collected from physical robot trial-and-error interactions are needed to train high-capacity models like CNNs for grasp prediction without overfitting. 2) Formulating grasp prediction as a multi-class classification over grasp angles for image patches works better than regression.3) A multi-stage reinforcement learning approach allows collecting hard negatives to train better grasp prediction models.4) Larger datasets and multi-stage training lead to better generalization performance in grasp prediction for novel objects.The paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale self-supervised data collection for grasp prediction, and show that larger datasets and multi-stage training can improve grasp prediction performance, especially for novel objects.
