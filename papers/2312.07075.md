# [Motion Planning and Control of A Morphing Quadrotor in Restricted   Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07075)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework enabling morphing quadrotors to autonomously adapt and efficiently traverse confined spaces by changing their geometric structure. Compared to fixed drones limited by size restrictions, the morphing mechanism with four external actuators allows the arms to fold and transform into different shapes like H, T or Y configurations. The framework integrates a real-time trajectory optimizer that considers structural changes and generates collision-free spatial-temporal trajectories encompassing position and orientation. It also employs a nonlinear controller that dynamically adapts to time-varying inertia, center of gravity, aerodynamic drag and thrust coefficients induced during morphing transitions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate traversing challenging narrow gaps, pipes and complex geometries, demonstrating enhanced efficiency over existing methods. The unified planning and control approach enables robust autonomous navigation in cluttered environments by exploiting morphology adaptation capabilities beyond limitations of conventional quadrotor platforms.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Motion Planning and Control of A Morphing Quadrotor in Restricted Scenarios":

Problem:
Conventional quadrotors have a fixed geometric structure which limits their ability to navigate through narrow spaces smaller than their size. While prior works have presented morphing quadrotors that can reduce their size by folding arms, existing methods have limitations in motion planning and control during morphological changes. Specifically, there are two main challenges: (1) Existing planning algorithms don't consider morphological changes which can lead to safety and dynamic feasibility issues. (2) Sudden changes in inertia and center of gravity during morphing compromise control accuracy. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a unified planning and control framework for morphing quadrotors to autonomously and efficiently deform in restricted environments. The main components are:

1. A real-time trajectory optimizer that incorporates the quadrotor's morphological changes to generate full-body collision-free trajectories with position and attitude. It constructs safe flight corridors using weighted A* search and represents the quadrotor body as dynamic polyhedral constraints during deformation.  

2. A nonlinear cascade control framework with feedforward compensation and online estimation of thrust coefficient to account for varying inertia, center of gravity, and other parameters during morphing. This enhances control accuracy.

Main Contributions:

1. A milliseconds-level trajectory optimizer considering morphological changes to produce full-body safety trajectories in real-time.

2. A unified nonlinear controller that adjusts time-varying parameters like inertia tensor, center of gravity, and thrust coefficient to maintain stable flight during morphing.  

3. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments in complex restricted environments to validate the proposed framework's performance and robustness in enabling autonomous deformation and navigation.

4. Comparisons with prior methods demonstrating the proposed controller's superior accuracy and stability in trajectory tracking for morphing quadrotors.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative planning and control framework for morphing drones to safely and efficiently maneuver restricted spaces by deforming themselves.
