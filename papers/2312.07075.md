# [Motion Planning and Control of A Morphing Quadrotor in Restricted   Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07075)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework enabling morphing quadrotors to autonomously adapt and efficiently traverse confined spaces by changing their geometric structure. Compared to fixed drones limited by size restrictions, the morphing mechanism with four external actuators allows the arms to fold and transform into different shapes like H, T or Y configurations. The framework integrates a real-time trajectory optimizer that considers structural changes and generates collision-free spatial-temporal trajectories encompassing position and orientation. It also employs a nonlinear controller that dynamically adapts to time-varying inertia, center of gravity, aerodynamic drag and thrust coefficients induced during morphing transitions. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate traversing challenging narrow gaps, pipes and complex geometries, demonstrating enhanced efficiency over existing methods. The unified planning and control approach enables robust autonomous navigation in cluttered environments by exploiting morphology adaptation capabilities beyond limitations of conventional quadrotor platforms.
