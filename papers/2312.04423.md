# [Scalable Knowledge Graph Construction and Inference on Human Genome   Variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04423)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the construction of a large-scale knowledge graph representing variant-level genomic information extracted from RNA sequencing data of COVID-19 patients. The raw sequencing data is processed through various tools to generate VCF files containing variants and associated CADD scores indicating variant deleteriousness. An ontology is defined to represent concepts like chromosomes, variants, scores, etc. and their relationships. The VCF data is translated to RDF triples using the SPARQLing Genomics tool and integrated with CADD scores and metadata to create the unified knowledge graph. This allows efficient storage, integration, querying and downstream analysis of complex genomic data. The authors demonstrate the utility of the knowledge graph via a case study of node classification to categorize variants based on CADD scores, using graph neural networks. Comparisons are provided between GCN and GraphSAGE models, with GraphSAGE achieving 91.02% test accuracy, highlighting knowledge graphs as a valuable asset for genomic data mining. Key contributions include the RNA variant-level knowledge graph creation methodology and a practical demonstration of its applicability for genomic inference tasks.
