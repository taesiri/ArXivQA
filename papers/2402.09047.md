# [FGeo-TP: A Language Model-Enhanced Solver for Geometry Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09047)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Solving geometry problems automatically using computers has been a long-standing challenge in AI. Prior work developed the FormalGeo system and FormalGeo7k dataset of geometry problems. 
- The Formal Geometry Problem Solver (FGPS) can solve problems from this dataset when given the sequence of theorems to apply, but struggles to search for the needed theorems itself, often timing out without finding a solution.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a Transformer-based neural Theorem Predictor module to guide and prune the search space for FGPS. This combined system is called FGeo-TP.
- Fine-tune various Transformer model architectures on predicting theorem sequences from the formal problem representations in FormalGeo7k. BART performs best with 86.29% accuracy.
- Have FGeo-TP first apply the predicted theorems before running FGPS's search, in order to narrow down the search space.

Main Contributions:
- FGeo-TP solves 80.86% of problems, more than doubling FGPS's 39.71% success rate, with lower timeout and unsolved rates.
- Average solving time reduced by over 25% and average steps by over 80% compared to FGPS.
- Performance gains are shown across easy to hard problem levels, with higher gains on easier problems.
- There is still room for improvement via more accurate theorem prediction and sequence ordering.

In summary, the paper demonstrates combining neural theorem prediction with a formal geometric solver to substantially improve automated reasoning capability for geometry problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FGeo-TP, an enhanced geometry problem solver that integrates a Transformer-based theorem predictor with FGPS to significantly improve solving rates and efficiency by pruning the search space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing the combination of the Formal Geometry Problem Solver (FGPS) and language models to streamline the search process for solving geometry problems. 

2. Evaluating multiple language models on the FormalGeo7k dataset for theorem sequence prediction, achieving high degrees of sequence matching. The BART-base model had the best performance with 86.29% average sequence matching.

3. Implementing FGeo-TP which integrates FGPS with the BART-base theorem predictor. This significantly improved the success rate of problem-solving on the FormalGeo7k dataset from 39.7% with FGPS alone to 80.86% with FGeo-TP.

4. Showing that FGeo-TP greatly reduces the search time and number of steps required to solve geometry problems across varying difficulty levels compared to using FGPS alone.

In summary, the key contribution is using language models to guide and prune the search process of a geometry problem solver, enabling much faster and more accurate automated solving of geometry questions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes combining a language model with FGPS to enhance automatic problem-solving capability for plane geometry problems. What are the key advantages of using a language model over other AI methods for predicting theorems? How does it help prune the search space?

2. The FormalGeo7k dataset plays a crucial role in training and evaluating the models. What are some key aspects of this dataset? How was it created and what makes it superior to other geometry datasets? 

3. The paper experiments with multiple Transformer-based language models like BART, T5, etc. for theorem prediction. What are the key architectural differences between these models? Why does BART perform the best for this particular task?

4. The predicted theorems are executed first by the solver before initiating search. How does executing these theorems help optimize the search process? Could executing incorrect theorems predicted by the model harm the solver?

5. Both forward and backward search strategies are evaluated. Why does backward search tend to perform better with FGeo-TP while forward search worked better for the original FGPS?

6. How is the formalized language in FormalGeo7k different from natural text data typically used in NLP tasks? What accommodations had to be made in the models to process this formal language effectively?  

7. Beam search is used during prediction to get multiple high-probability theorem sequences. How is the final predicted sequence derived from these? How does beam size impact model accuracy and efficiency?

8. The paper observes that combining FGeo-TP and FGPS performs better than using FGeo-TP alone for forward search. What is the hypothesized reason behind unnecessary theorems diluting performance?  

9. The gains from FGeo-TP are much more pronounced for lower difficulty level problems. Why does its effectiveness decrease for higher-difficulty problems? How can this be improved?

10. The theorem predictor matches about 86% of theorems on average currently. What are some ways in which the accuracy of the predictor can be further improved to minimize unnecessary predictions?
