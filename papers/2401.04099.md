# [AGG: Amortized Generative 3D Gaussians for Single Image to 3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04099)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Generating 3D objects represented as 3D Gaussian splatting models from a single image is an important capability for automatic 3D content creation. 
- Existing methods rely on costly per-instance optimization or sampling processes. Building an amortized feedforward model is challenging due to the dynamic number of Gaussians and difficulty of joint optimization of geometry and texture.

Proposed Method:
- The authors propose AGG, an amortized generative 3D Gaussian framework with a cascaded generation pipeline.

- Stage 1: A coarse hybrid generator predicts Gaussian locations and a texture field separately using transformers. This allows stable joint optimization. Locations query the texture field for other attributes. 

- Stage 2: A UNet-based network with point-voxel layers super-resolves the coarse Gaussians by expanding the feature dimension as a proxy for increasing number of points. RGB features are incorporated via cross-attention for better textures.

- Canonical isotropic scales and rotations stabilize training without access to optimization-based density control operations. The network is pre-trained with pseudo-labels for better initialization.

Contributions:
- First work on amortized single image to 3D Gaussian generation without per-instance optimization.

- Novel cascaded pipeline with hybrid generator and super-resolution module.

- Decomposed geometry and texture prediction enables stable training.  

- Demonstrated competitive image quality and orders of magnitude faster inference than optimization-based and sampling-based baselines.

In summary, the paper introduces a new cascaded deep generative model to tackle amortized single image to 3D Gaussian conversion, which is orders of magnitude faster while achieving competitive visual quality. The decomposed hybrid representation and incorporation of pseudo-labels enable effective end-to-end training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes AGG, an amortized generative framework with a cascaded pipeline to instantly produce 3D Gaussian representations from a single image input, without needing per-instance optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing AGG, the first amortized framework that can generate 3D Gaussians from a single image input in one shot. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Conducting a pilot study on the task of amortized single image-to-3D Gaussian generation, unlike existing works that operate on individual objects through optimization.

2) Proposing a novel cascaded generation pipeline, comprising a coarse hybrid generator that predicts 3D Gaussians at low resolution, and a Gaussian super-resolution module to produce dense 3D Gaussians. 

3) Decomposing the geometry and texture generation through separate transformers in the coarse hybrid generator for more stable training.

4) Introducing a UNet-based architecture with point-voxel layers for effectively super-resolving the 3D Gaussians in the second stage.

5) Demonstrating competitive quantitative and qualitative performance compared to optimization-based 3D Gaussian methods and other sampling-based pipelines, while enabling feed-forward image-to-3D generation and being orders of magnitude faster.

In summary, the main contribution is designing the first amortized framework AGG that can instantly generate 3D Gaussians from a single image without needing per-instance optimization.
