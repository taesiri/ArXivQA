# [VIALM: A Survey and Benchmark of Visually Impaired Assistance with Large   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper introduces the task of Visually Impaired Assistance with Large Models (VIALM). The goal is to leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs) and embodied agents to assist visually impaired (VI) people in their daily lives.  

- Specifically, given an image of a physical environment and a linguistic request from a VI user, VIALM aims to output step-by-step guidance grounded in the environment to help the user complete their request.

- The paper conducts a literature survey showing rapid progress in LLMs, VLMs and embodied agents, and raises the question whether these models can transform visually impaired assistance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper constructs the first VIALM benchmark comprising 200 image-question-answer samples covering home and supermarket environments.

- Six state-of-the-art VLMs are evaluated on this benchmark in a zero-shot setting: GPT-4, CogVLM, MiniGPT, Qwen-VL, LLaVA and BLIVA. Both automatic metrics and human evaluation are used.

Key Findings:
- Benchmark experiments reveal two main limitations in current VLMs: (1) lack of environment grounding - 25.7% of GPT-4's responses are not grounded; (2) lack of fine-grained guidance - 32.1% of GPT-4's responses are not fine-grained.

- Analysis shows visually-focused models (like CogVLM) better understand environments, while linguistically-focused models (like LLaVA) generate easier-to-follow guidance.

- Tactile sensations are rarely incorporated even when explicitly prompted, with only GPT-4 providing some general tactile guidance.

Main Contributions:
- First extensive study investigating how LMs can transform visually impaired assistance. 

- Comprehensive survey of latest LMs - LLMs, VLMs and embodied agents.

- New VIALM benchmark and empirical findings regarding limitations of state-of-the-art LMs on this assistive task.

- Analysis providing guidance for developing LMs better suited for visually impaired assistance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces the task of Visually Impaired Assistance with Large Models (VIALM), surveys related work on large language, vision-language, and embodied agent models, constructs a benchmark dataset, and conducts an empirical evaluation revealing limitations in grounding and fine-grained guidance generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1) The paper introduces a novel task called VIALM (Visual Impaired Assistance with Language Models) to extensively investigate how large language models (LLMs) can transform the landscape of visually impaired assistance (VIA). 

2) The paper thoroughly surveys important LLM work, including LLMs, large visual-language models (VLMs), and embodied agents, that hold potential benefits for VIA.

3) The paper presents a fundamental benchmark for empirical studies of the VIALM task by formulating it to follow a visual question answering (VQA) setup. The benchmark comprises 200 visual environment images paired with questions (user requests) and answers (VIA guidance). Experiments are conducted on the benchmark to examine selected SOTA VLMs.

In summary, the main contributions are proposing the VIALM task, surveying relevant LM work, and constructing an initial benchmark to facilitate empirical analysis of LMs on the VIALM task.
