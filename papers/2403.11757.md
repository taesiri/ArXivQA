## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The paper tackles the problem of cross-cultural humor detection from multimodal data, consisting of video, audio and text. Specifically, the task is to detect humor from German training data and transfer the knowledge to identify humor from English test data.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a Multi-Modal Transformer with Graph Distillation (MMT-GD) model. It extracts the best unimodal features from video (ResNet50), audio (Wav2Vec2.0) and text (BERT).  
- The features are input to three separate Multimodal Transformers that leverage self-attention and cross-attention to model unimodal and cross-modal interactions.
- The MMT outputs are concatenated and passed to a classifier to predict humor. Graph distillation is used to transfer knowledge between modalities.
- Data augmentation via modality dropout during training improves model robustness.

Main Contributions:

- Novel MMT-GD model architecture combining multimodal transformer and graph distillation for cross-cultural humor detection.

- Evaluation of multiple advanced unimodal features like MANet, ResNet50 and Wav2Vec2.0 tailored for the task.

- Demonstration of promising performance - AUC of 0.8704 on the test set, with relative gains over baseline and securing 3rd position in the MuSe 2023 challenge.

The summary conveys the key aspects around the problem being addressed, the techniques used to tackle it, as well as the main outcomes of the research described in the paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
