# [Multi Agent Pathfinding for Noise Restricted Hybrid Fuel Unmanned Aerial   Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17849)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of multi-agent path finding (MAPF) for a fleet of hybrid-fuel unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are subject to location-dependent noise restrictions. Specifically, the UAVs have a combustion engine to recharge the battery, but the engine cannot be used in noise-restricted areas. The goal is to find optimal, conflict-free paths for all UAVs from their start locations to goal locations, while respecting the UAVs' fuel/energy constraints and avoiding the noise-restricted areas when the engine is on. This is called the Noise-Restricted Hybrid-Fuel MAPF (NRHF-MAPF) problem.

Solution:
The authors solve the NRHF-MAPF problem by using the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm. CBS searches a constraint tree where each node contains a set of single-agent path finding problems, one for each UAV. Constraints are added to avoid conflicts as they are encountered. The key subproblem that must be solved at each node is a Noise-Restricted Hybrid-Fuel Shortest Path Problem (NRHFSPP) for each UAV, which finds the minimum-cost path subject to the fuel/energy and noise restrictions. The authors adapt an existing labeling algorithm for the NRHFSPP to handle conflict zones as dynamic obstacles.

Contributions:
(1) Formulation and study of the NRHF-MAPF, a new MAPF variant.
(2) MILP formulation of NRHF-MAPF.  
(3) Adaptation of a labeling algorithm for the NP-hard NRHFSPP subproblem to enable use within CBS by treating conflict zones as dynamic obstacles.
(4) Computational results showing the effectiveness of CBS paired with the labeling algorithm for solving test instances of the NRHF-MAPF for up to 10 agents and 225 nodes.

In summary, the paper presents a new variant of the MAPF problem for hybrid-fuel UAVs, provides a MILP formulation, leverages CBS with a tailored labeling algorithm subroutine to find solutions, and demonstrates the capability on test scenarios.
