# [Linking Emergent and Natural Languages via Corpus Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13344)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we effectively link emergent and natural languages to enable transfer of knowledge between them?Specifically, the authors aim to investigate whether an emergent language developed through a referential game can provide beneficial transfer to downstream natural language tasks like language modeling and image captioning. They propose and explore a novel corpus transfer approach, where they pretrain models on a corpus of emergent language messages before fine-tuning on natural language data. The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Emergent languages developed through grounded multi-agent communication can provide non-trivial benefits when transferred to natural language tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios.2) Corpus-level transfer is more effective than transfer at the level of emergent communication agents.3) Translation from emergent to natural language provides a better measure of emergent language quality than metrics based on game accuracy or topological similarity.So in summary, the central research question is whether and how emergent and natural languages can be effectively linked to enable mutually beneficial transfer, with a focus on corpus-level transfer and translation-based evaluation of emergent languages. The authors aim to bridge the gap between emergent communication research and natural language processing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the abstract, it seems this paper proposes a novel method to link emergent and natural languages by using corpus transfer, i.e. pretraining a model on a corpus of emergent language from a referential game for downstream natural language tasks like language modeling and image captioning. The key contributions appear to be:- Showing that pretraining on an emergent language corpus can provide non-trivial benefits for downstream natural language tasks, especially in low-resource setups. For example, pretraining on 2 million emergent tokens reduces perplexity by 24.6% on average for modeling 10 different languages with only 2 million natural tokens each.- Proposing a new emergent-to-natural language translation metric to evaluate emergent languages, and showing it correlates better with downstream performance than common in-game metrics like accuracy and topographic similarity.- Demonstrating that corpus transfer is more effective for transferring emergent languages compared to directly transferring trained EC model parameters as in prior work.- Highlighting the potential of leveraging natural language resources and models to improve emergent communication research, instead of focusing only on synthetic setups.In summary, the key contribution seems to be presenting corpus transfer as a novel paradigm to link emergent and natural languages for mutual benefits, supported by experiments showing non-trivial transfer results and analysis into what properties contribute to transferability.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in the field of emergent communication:- This paper proposes a new approach of evaluating emergent languages by transferring them to natural language tasks, rather than just analyzing properties within the communication game itself. Most prior work focuses on in-game metrics like accuracy or attribute disentanglement. This allows for assessing emergent languages in terms of real-world usefulness.- The paper shows that an emergent language corpus can help pre-train models for natural language tasks, especially in low-resource settings. This provides evidence that emergent languages can transfer outside of the game they are developed in. Prior work has not extensively explored such out-of-game transfer.- The paper introduces a new metric based on emergent-to-natural language translation, and shows it better correlates with transfer performance than game accuracy or topographic similarity. This challenges common assumptions on what properties of emergent languages are most important.- The approach relies on standard natural language resources (e.g. Wikipedia corpora) and models (e.g. Transformers). Many prior emergent communication studies use synthetic environments and simple recurrent models. This work demonstrates the potential benefits of leveraging advanced NLP techniques.- Overall, the core idea of directly linking emergent and natural languages is novel. The paper makes good progress toward bridging the gap between the emergent communication and natural language processing fields. Evaluating based on natural language tasks and models could become a paradigm shift.In summary, this paper pushes emergent communication research to go beyond in-game metrics and synthetic setups, toward more standardized evaluations grounded in real language data and tasks. It opens up many new directions at the intersection of emergent communication and natural language processing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring how to evolve emergent languages with more complexities and structures that better resemble natural language. The authors suggest this could be done by testing existing approaches for improving emergent communication through their proposed transfer scheme.- Using natural language resources and models to potentially improve emergent communication research. For example, leveraging large text corpora or pre-trained language models as inductive biases.- Developing more fine-grained metrics and evaluations tailored to specific structural properties of natural language (e.g. morphology, argument structure), beyond the current game metrics. - Studying the potential synergies between emergent communication and natural language processing research. For example, using emergent languages to improve sample efficiency and generalization in NLP models.- Designing tasks and environments where emergent communication could provide greater benefits for downstream NLP applications, such as in low-resource settings or for vision-and-language tasks where annotation is costly.- Analyzing the tradeoffs between simpler emergent languages that are easier to acquire and complex natural languages with more expressivity, in order to determine optimal language designs.- Exploring the paradigm of directly evaluating and analyzing emergent languages by linking them to natural language tasks and metrics, rather than solely analyzing intrinsic properties within each game.In summary, the key suggested directions are: closer integration between emergent communication and natural language research, developing more realistic and complex emergent languages, designing appropriate tasks and metrics for evaluation, and shifting overall paradigms for analyzing language emergence.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a novel way to link emergent and natural languages by pretraining on a corpus of emergent language for downstream natural language tasks. Emergent communication (EC) aims to understand how languages emerge from multi-agent interactions grounded in perception, but emergent languages are typically only analyzed within the game framework. This work proposes corpus transfer, where an emergent language corpus is used to pretrain models for natural language tasks like language modeling and image captioning. Experiments show non-trivial benefits from emergent language pretraining, especially when natural language resources are limited. For example, pretraining on 2 million tokens of emergent language reduces perplexity by 24.6% on average for modeling 10 low-resource languages. This demonstrates emergent languages can transfer usefulness beyond just game success.The paper also proposes translating emergent to natural language as a metric to evaluate emergent languages, instead of common in-game metrics like accuracy or attribute disentanglement. This translation metric better correlates with downstream performance, suggesting rigid disentanglement may be flawed for capturing complexities of natural language like morphology and context. Overall, this work links emergent and natural languages via corpus transfer and translation, demonstrating emergent languages can be analyzed beyond synthetic games. The paradigm shift of utilizing natural language resources and models could mutually benefit emergent communication and NLP research.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach to link emergent languages from referential games to natural languages by leveraging corpus transfer. Specifically, the authors first train a speaker model on a referential game with images as inputs to generate a corpus of emergent language messages. Then they use this emergent language corpus to pre-train language models for two downstream tasks - language modeling and image captioning - with natural language data. By evaluating the transfer performance from emergent to natural language tasks, especially in low-resource setups, they demonstrate that emergent languages can provide non-trivial benefits for modeling natural languages. The key novelty is the use of corpus transfer to evaluate and understand emergent languages, compared to prior work that focuses on in-game metrics or directly transfers emergent communication models. The authors also propose a simpler metric based on translating emergent to natural language captions on shared images, and show it better correlates with downstream performance than game accuracy or message disentanglement. Overall, the work provides new techniques to link emergent and natural languages for mutual benefits.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper aims to link emergent languages from multi-agent communication games with natural languages. Emergent languages are protocols developed by artificial agents through interactions and perceptual grounding, while natural languages are human languages like English. - Prior work on emergent communication focuses on analyzing properties of the learned protocols within game environments. However, it is unclear if and how emergent languages connect to real-world natural language processing. - This paper proposes a new way to establish such a link by transferring an emergent language corpus to pre-train models for downstream natural language tasks like language modeling and image captioning.- Through experiments, the paper shows that pretraining on emergent language corpora provides non-trivial benefits for low-resource natural language modeling across diverse languages.- The paper also proposes a new metric to evaluate emergent languages based on how well they can be translated to corresponding natural language captions. This metric better correlates with downstream task performance than common in-game metrics.In summary, the key problem is bridging emergent and natural languages to understand if and how emergent languages developed by AI agents can be useful for real-world language tasks and exhibit properties of natural languages. The paper offers corpus transfer and translation as solutions to link the two types of languages.
