# [Linking Emergent and Natural Languages via Corpus Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13344)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we effectively link emergent and natural languages to enable transfer of knowledge between them?Specifically, the authors aim to investigate whether an emergent language developed through a referential game can provide beneficial transfer to downstream natural language tasks like language modeling and image captioning. They propose and explore a novel corpus transfer approach, where they pretrain models on a corpus of emergent language messages before fine-tuning on natural language data. The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Emergent languages developed through grounded multi-agent communication can provide non-trivial benefits when transferred to natural language tasks, especially in low-resource scenarios.2) Corpus-level transfer is more effective than transfer at the level of emergent communication agents.3) Translation from emergent to natural language provides a better measure of emergent language quality than metrics based on game accuracy or topological similarity.So in summary, the central research question is whether and how emergent and natural languages can be effectively linked to enable mutually beneficial transfer, with a focus on corpus-level transfer and translation-based evaluation of emergent languages. The authors aim to bridge the gap between emergent communication research and natural language processing.
