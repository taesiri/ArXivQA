## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes ZeroRF, a novel method for fast and high-quality 360-degree scene reconstruction from sparse views. ZeroRF integrates a tailored deep image prior into a factorized neural radiance field to enable efficient optimization without pretraining or regularization. Specifically, it parametrizes the feature grids of representations like TensoRF using randomly-initialized deep generator networks. This allows the model to learn multi-scale patterns from sparse observations and naturally generalize to novel views. Extensive experiments demonstrate ZeroRF's state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, reconstructing high-quality novel views in as little as 30 seconds. The method requires no additional supervision or priors beyond the input images. ZeroRF also shows promising applications for 3D content generation and editing tasks. Its overall versatility, speed, and quality establish ZeroRF as an impactful advancement for sparse view reconstruction and related domains.
