# [Active Reinforcement Learning for Robust Building Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10289)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents for tasks like building HVAC control often overfit to their training environments and fail to generalize to new settings. This is problematic as weather conditions often exhibit extremes or drift over time.
- Current work on making RL agents robust focuses on long-term climate change, not short-term extreme weather events. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new algorithm called ActivePLR that uses uncertainty-aware neural networks to actively seek out training environments on the frontier of the agent's capabilities. 
- ActivePLR incorporates both hard constraints and soft constraints when generating new environments to ensure realism and prioritization of key conditions.
- It builds on prioritized level replay (PLR) by using gradient ascent to maximize uncertainty when selecting new environments.

Contributions:
- First use of neural network uncertainty for unsupervised environment design.
- First gradient-based approach to optimizing environment parameters (rather than evolutionary or separate networks).
- Evaluation in HVAC control showing ActivePLR agents optimize energy and comfort better than baselines during extreme weather.
- Experiments demonstrate ActivePLR agents transfer better from simulation to real-world than alternatives.
- Analysis on 120 real weather patterns shows advantage of ActivePLR over methods that can generate unrealistic environments.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and empirical contributions in using active learning based on model uncertainty to improve simulator-based RL agent robustness for short-term extreme weather events. The HVAC control experiments demonstrate clear advantages over existing alternative methods.
