# [On Hallucinating Context and Background Pixels from a Face Mask using
  Multi-scale GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07104)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to hallucinate realistic context and background pixels from only a face mask input using a multi-scale generative adversarial network (GAN) model. 

The key hypothesis is that a cascaded network of GAN blocks, with each block operating at a different resolution and guided by the previous block, can generate high quality and identity-preserving synthetic context and background for a face mask. The model aims to produce realistic full face images starting only from the provided face region, without requiring any additional user input or annotation.

In summary, the main research questions and hypotheses are:

- Can a GAN model directly generate realistic context and background pixels from only a face mask, without any user guidance? 

- Will a cascaded multi-resolution approach, with each GAN block predicting pixels at a certain scale while being guided by lower resolution predictions, produce better results compared to a single resolution model?

- Can such a model generate identity-preserving and realistic synthetic face images for varied datasets not seen during training?

- How does this approach compare with existing facial inpainting and face swapping methods in terms of image realism and identity preservation?

- Can the model act as a data augmentation technique by generating supplemental training images with diverse context/background for existing datasets?

The paper presents experiments to validate these hypotheses and demonstrates the model's ability to produce high quality synthetic face images starting from varied face masks across different datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is a multi-scale GAN model to automatically generate realistic context (forehead, hair, neck, clothes) and background pixels from only an input face mask, without requiring any user supervision. 

Specifically, the key aspects of the proposed method are:

- A cascaded network of GAN blocks, with each block tasked with hallucinating missing pixels at a particular resolution, while guiding the synthesis process of the next block.

- The model takes just a face mask as input, with all context/background pixels masked to black, and generates a full face image with hallucinated context and background.

- The hallucinated output is made photo-realistic through a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial and identity preserving losses at each GAN block.

- Although trained on images from a controlled dataset, the model generalizes well to diverse real-world face images, as demonstrated through experiments on LFW and IJB-B datasets.

- Comparisons with facial inpainting and face swapping methods show the proposed model generates more identity-preserving and realistic results when having to hallucinate large missing regions.

- Analysis of using the model for data augmentation shows improved CNN training, validating its ability to generate supplemental synthetic training data.

In summary, the key contribution is a GAN framework to automatically generate context and background for a face mask input, without user guidance, through a multi-scale cascaded network trained with multiple losses. The method shows good generalization and utility for tasks like data augmentation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper: 

The paper proposes a multi-scale GAN model composed of cascaded encoder-decoder networks that can hallucinate realistic context and background pixels from an input face mask, without requiring any user annotations, using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial and identity preserving losses at different resolutions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on hallucinating face context and background compares to other related work:

- Rather than face swapping or inpainting, it focuses on generating the entire context and background from just a face mask. Most prior work focuses on manipulating part of the face or filling in small missing regions, not hallucinating the whole surrounding image.

- It uses a cascaded GAN architecture to generate missing pixels at multiple resolutions. This is a unique approach compared to other face synthesis methods that use single-stage GANs. The cascaded approach allows guiding the synthesis process across scales.

- The method requires only a small training set of a few thousand images. Many recent face synthesis techniques rely on very large datasets or generative models pre-trained on massive image collections. This work shows good results can be achieved with a fairly small custom dataset.

- Quantitative experiments compare the method to recent face inpainting and swapping techniques. The cascaded GANs outperform these approaches in terms of identity preservation, realism, and perceptual quality.

- Ablation studies analyze the effect of different loss components and the impact of cascaded training versus progressive growing. This provides useful analysis and insights for the field.

- The potential application for data augmentation is demonstrated by showing improved CNN training when adding synthetic context/background to existing face images. This is a novel application area compared to most face manipulation works.

Overall, the cascaded GAN approach, experiments, and focus on full context/background generation rather than just face manipulation help differentiate this work from prior art in face synthesis and editing. The comparisons and ablations provide useful analysis to advance the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Increasing the resolution of the synthesized face images, possibly by adding more generator blocks to the cascaded network in a progressive manner similar to ProGANs (Progressive Growing of GANs). The authors suggest this could allow generating higher resolution and more detailed synthetic faces.

- Varying the soft facial features and style of the generated faces by adding style-based noise to the generator, while keeping the subject identity constant. This could help produce more diversity in the synthesized faces. 

- Extending the approach to work on full face videos rather than just individual images. Generating synthetic video sequences could be useful for applications like data augmentation and creating synthetic media.

- Using the model as a data augmentation module to generate supplemental training data for CNNs. The authors show it can be used to augment real datasets by generating varied hair, backgrounds, etc. Expanding this to augment synthetic data could also be worthwhile.

- Addressing limitations like handling occlusions, preserving identity-related attributes like gender consistently, and handling accessories like glasses better. The authors suggest ideas like training on more diverse data, using attribute-preserving losses, and data augmentation.

- Exploring variations of the model architecture and training process, such as using different GAN loss functions or using more advanced architectures. This could potentially improve the results.

- Evaluating the generated images on additional benchmarks and metrics to better understand the strengths and limitations. The authors use metrics like SSIM, FID score and perceptual error but more analyses could be useful.

So in summary, the main directions mentioned are increasing resolution, improving diversity, extending to video, using for data augmentation, addressing current limitations, and further benchmarking and analysis. The core idea seems promising for face synthesis and manipulation tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-scale cascaded GAN model to hallucinate realistic context and background pixels from an input masked face image. The model is composed of a series of GAN blocks that each learn to generate missing pixels at a particular resolution, with the output of one block fed to the next to guide the synthesis process. The final 128x128 hallucinated face image is made photo-realistic through a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, adversarial, and identity-preserving losses at each block. Experiments demonstrate the model can generate diverse and identity-preserving results on challenging real-world face images, outperforming facial inpainting and swapping methods. Potential applications include data augmentation by generating supplemental training images and creating synthetic face images for media usage without privacy concerns. A cascaded training approach is shown to produce better results than progressive growing of GANs for this task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-scale cascaded GAN model to hallucinate realistic context and background pixels given only an input face mask. The model is composed of multiple GAN blocks, with each block tasked with generating missing pixels at a particular resolution, starting from low resolution and progressively increasing. At each block, the model combines various losses - pixel-wise, perceptual, adversarial, identity preserving - to generate realistic and identity-preserving results. The output of each block is upscaled and provided as input to the next block, giving a rough initial estimate to guide the hallucination process. Though trained on a small dataset of 12K face images only, the model can synthesize diverse, realistic context and background pixels for face masks from other datasets with variety in pose, expression and lighting. Experiments demonstrate the model generates more realistic and identity-preserving results compared to facial inpainting and face swapping methods. The synthesized images could also be used to augment training data for CNNs by increasing variability in hair, clothing and background.

In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: (1) A cascaded GAN model to hallucinate entire context/background from only a face mask, without needing other face images or user guidance. (2) Comparisons showing the model generates more realistic and identity-preserving results than facial inpainting and face swapping methods. (3) Analysis of the model's use for augmenting CNN training data by generating varied context/background for existing subjects. (4) Ablation studies analyzing the role of different losses, and comparison of cascaded training versus progressive growing. The model provides an effective approach for synthesizing context and background pixels from limited facial information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a multi-scale cascaded generative adversarial network (GAN) model to hallucinate realistic context and background pixels from an input face mask. The key points are:

- The model uses a cascaded network of GAN blocks to synthesize missing context and background pixels at multiple resolutions (from 8x8 to 128x128). Each block contains an encoder-decoder generator and a discriminator. 

- The input to the first block is a low-resolution masked face image. The output of each block is upscaled and fed as input to the next block, providing a rough hallucination to guide the next block.

- The generator in each block is trained with a weighted combination of reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, adversarial loss from the discriminator, and identity preserving loss using VGG-Face features. This results in photo-realistic and identity-preserving hallucinations.

- The cascaded architecture allows progressive refinement of the hallucinated pixels across resolutions. Experiments show it generates better results than training the blocks independently or using a progressively growing GAN approach.

- The model is trained on 12K face images but can generalize to diverse datasets like LFW and IJB-B. It outperforms facial inpainting methods in realism and identity preservation when hallucinating large missing regions.

- The hallucinated images can also be used to augment training data for CNNs by adding synthetic context/background to existing subjects. This improves recognition performance.

In summary, the cascaded multi-scale GAN model can hallucinate photo-realistic context and background pixels from just a face mask input using a combination of losses, without requiring any user annotations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to automatically hallucinate (synthesize) realistic context and background pixels for a face image, given only the face mask as input. 

In more detail:

- The paper notes that existing generative models for face synthesis require the full face image, including context (forehead, hair, neck, clothes) and background pixels, in order to generate realistic results. They fail when only a face mask is provided.

- Facial inpainting models can fill in small missing regions on or near the face, but struggle when the entire context and background need to be hallucinated.

- Face swapping methods replace the face in one image with a face from another, but require full images and have constraints on appearance similarity. 

- The key problem is how to automatically generate realistic context and background pixels for a face mask input, without requiring the full face image or user guidance/supervision.

- The paper proposes a multi-scale cascaded GAN model to address this problem. It learns to hallucinate missing context/background pixels at multiple resolutions, using a combination of losses to produce realistic and identity-preserving results.

So in summary, the main problem is how to hallucinate realistic context and background for a face mask input, which existing generative and inpainting models fail to adequately address. The paper proposes a cascaded GAN approach to tackle this problem in an automatic, unsupervised manner.
