# [Emotion Classification in Low and Moderate Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- There are over 7,100 languages spoken globally, but building emotion classification models for each one is very labor intensive. This is especially challenging for low-resource and endangered languages. 
- The paper explores how to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages (like English) to low and moderate resource languages to create cross-lingual emotion classifiers without needing machine translation.

Proposed Solutions:
1) Annotation Projection 
- Uses parallel corpora between English and the target language to project emotion labels from English to the target language. This creates a labeled dataset in the target language that can train an emotion classifier.

2) Direct Cross-Lingual Transfer
- Learns unified multilingual representations between English and the target language using embedding alignment techniques. Then trains an emotion classifier on English and applies it to the target language.

Main Contributions:
- Evaluates and compares the annotation projection and direct transfer methods on 6 languages spanning low to moderate resource.
- Annotation projection achieves good performance using in-genre parallel data. Direct transfer works better for out-of-genre scenarios.
- Introduces techniques like pivoting through related languages and using emotion lexicon features to improve cross-lingual transfer.
- Creates and releases new emotion classified corpora for four low-resource languages - Farsi, Azerbaijani, Ilocano and Odia. Also builds emotion lexicons for Ilocano and Odia.

In summary, the paper explores different techniques for cross-lingual transfer of emotion classifiers to low resource languages. The techniques are evaluated on languages from diverse families and resource levels. Both annotation projection and direct transfer methods are able to outperform random baseline indicating successful cross-lingual transfer of emotions.
