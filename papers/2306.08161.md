# [h2oGPT: Democratizing Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08161)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the key research focus of this paper is on developing open source large language models (LLMs) and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) through the h2oGPT project. The overarching goal seems to be creating the "world's best truly open-source alternative" to proprietary and closed-source LLMs and GPTs. Specifically, some of the central research aims appear to be:- Developing open source LLMs/GPTs ranging from 7B to 40B parameters using existing open source foundation models like GPT-NeoX and Falcon.- Creating curated fine-tuning datasets and methods to effectively adapt these foundation models for conversational chatbots and document search capabilities.- Optimizing model training techniques like LoRA and low-precision training for efficient fine-tuning on commodity hardware. - Building an ecosystem of open source tools and frameworks like the h2oGPT repository, LLM Studio, chatbots, and document search to enable widespread adoption.- Validating the capabilities and limitations of the open source h2oGPT models in areas like general chat, summarization, creativity etc.So in summary, the core research focus seems to be on developing, fine-tuning and validating open source LLMs/GPTs to match or exceed proprietary alternatives, while promoting openness, customizability and accessibility. The hypothesis appears to be that this open source strategy can successfully democratize large language models.
