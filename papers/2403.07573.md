## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Future 6G systems will see explosive growth in devices, data, and new immersive services like the Metaverse. This will create huge demands for computing and network resources that need to be jointly orchestrated to meet stringent QoS/QoE requirements.  
- Existing resource orchestration approaches operate in silos and cannot handle the dynamic nature of user behavior, services, and resources in future systems.

Proposed Solution - Adaptable Computing-Network Convergence (ACNC):
- An integrated orchestration framework that brings together computing and network resources for joint optimization, enabled by machine learning.
- Key innovations:
   - Hierarchical state recognition - Efficiently extracts and reduces the complexity of system states across users, services, computing and network domains.  
   - Context detection - Categorizes reduced system states into contexts and dedicates ML agents to each one to enable efficient decision making.
   - Continual learning - Allows agents to adapt to changes in their context without forgetting previously learned knowledge.
- Components: Service, end-to-end, domain and resource orchestrators that collaborate in a closed control loop.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualizes adaptable computing-network convergence and proposes a detailed architecture.
- Applies continual learning and context detection to address resource orchestration in highly dynamic 6G systems.
- Evaluates ACNC in a Metaverse use case and shows superior performance over optimal and random allocation strategies.
- Discusses multiple challenges and future research directions related to digital twin integration, end-to-end performance evaluation, and balancing precision vs. cost in ML decisions.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative machine learning-driven resource orchestration framework to jointly optimize computing and network resources in future extremely dynamic 6G systems to enable new immersive services.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an adaptable machine learning framework called Adaptable Computing-Network Convergence (ACNC) to enable efficient joint orchestration of dynamic computing and network resources to support future connected services through techniques like hierarchical state construction, continual learning for context detection, segment routing, and closed-loop optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Adaptable Computing-Network Convergence (ACNC) framework for the joint orchestration of computing and network resources. Specifically, ACNC employs machine learning techniques for state recognition and context detection to efficiently allocate resources and handle the dynamic nature of users, services, and infrastructure in future networks like 6G. Key aspects of ACNC include:

- Hierarchical state construction and dimension reduction to extract live, holistic system states representing the complex user-service-computing-network space
- Context detection to categorize system states and enable dedicated ML agents to make efficient resource allocation decisions for similar states within a context
- Integration of Continual Learning principles to mitigate catastrophic forgetting across different contexts
- Closed-loop system with domain and end-to-end orchestrators overseeing resources to construct system states and adjust resource allocations
- Analysis showing superior performance of ACNC compared to optimal and random allocation strategies

In summary, ACNC introduces a novel approach to tackle the joint orchestration problem in dynamic future networks by combining computing-network convergence with adaptable machine learning techniques for state recognition and context detection.
