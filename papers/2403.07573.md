# [Towards a Dynamic Future with Adaptable Computing and Network   Convergence (ACNC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07573)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Future 6G systems will see explosive growth in devices, data, and new immersive services like the Metaverse. This will create huge demands for computing and network resources that need to be jointly orchestrated to meet stringent QoS/QoE requirements.  
- Existing resource orchestration approaches operate in silos and cannot handle the dynamic nature of user behavior, services, and resources in future systems.

Proposed Solution - Adaptable Computing-Network Convergence (ACNC):
- An integrated orchestration framework that brings together computing and network resources for joint optimization, enabled by machine learning.
- Key innovations:
   - Hierarchical state recognition - Efficiently extracts and reduces the complexity of system states across users, services, computing and network domains.  
   - Context detection - Categorizes reduced system states into contexts and dedicates ML agents to each one to enable efficient decision making.
   - Continual learning - Allows agents to adapt to changes in their context without forgetting previously learned knowledge.
- Components: Service, end-to-end, domain and resource orchestrators that collaborate in a closed control loop.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualizes adaptable computing-network convergence and proposes a detailed architecture.
- Applies continual learning and context detection to address resource orchestration in highly dynamic 6G systems.
- Evaluates ACNC in a Metaverse use case and shows superior performance over optimal and random allocation strategies.
- Discusses multiple challenges and future research directions related to digital twin integration, end-to-end performance evaluation, and balancing precision vs. cost in ML decisions.

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative machine learning-driven resource orchestration framework to jointly optimize computing and network resources in future extremely dynamic 6G systems to enable new immersive services.
