# [Learning Curricula in Open-Ended Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents easily overfit to their training environments and struggle to generalize to new scenarios. This limits their applicability in real-world settings which are inherently open-ended.
- Simply randomizing training environments is not enough, as useful instances may rarely or never be sampled. An intelligent curriculum over environments is needed.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop a class of methods called Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) to automatically generate a curriculum of environments tailored to continually improve the agent's capabilities. 
- UED formulates the curriculum generation problem as a competitive game between a student agent and teacher(s). The student tries to solve environments while the teacher creates new challenges at the frontier of the student's abilities.

Key Contributions:
1. Prioritized Level Replay (PLR): Scalable method to curate random environments by estimating learning potential of replaying them. Significantly improves generalization.

2. Dual Curriculum Design (DCD): New perspective to unify PLR with adversarial UED methods like PAIRED. Provides theoretical guarantees on robustness. Introduces Robust PLR and REPAIRED with such guarantees.

3. Adversarially Compounding Complexity by Editing Levels (ACCEL): Powerful combination of PLR with evolution to generate environments, avoiding need for separate teacher models. Produces high complexity levels using far less compute than alternatives.

4. Sample-Matched PLR (SAMPLR): Formalizes and provides solution to curriculum-induced covariate shift, ensuring optimality on ground-truth distribution while allowing biased curricula over aleatoric parameters.

Overall, the thesis develops more scalable, efficient and principled UED methods to produce agents with improved robustness and generality, serving as stepping stones toward open-ended learning systems.
