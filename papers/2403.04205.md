# [OGMP: Oracle Guided Multimodal Policies for Agile and Versatile Robot   Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods for robot control achieve good empirical performance but lack a unified framework for systematically constructing optimal policies to solve general tasks. They have issues like finite exploration, reward engineering challenges, and susceptibility to local optima.

- There is a need for a theoretically grounded framework that addresses the above limitations and enables agile and versatile robot control through behavioral multimodality.

Proposed Solution - Oracle Guided Multimodal Policies (OGMP):

- Breaks down a task into principal behavioral modes and mode parameter sets required to solve the task sufficiently.

- Designs an oracle that provides approximate state trajectory references to guide policy exploration. The oracle leverages task-based priors and dynamics models. 

- Trains a latent-conditioned multimodal policy that operates in the behavioral modes defined by the task. The policy is optimized to track the oracle's references, enabling efficient guided exploration.

- Performs latent mode space reachability analysis to quantify policy versatility using a feasible mode set function.

Key Contributions:

- Theoretical framework for task-centered control synthesis using oracle-guided optimization and task-vital multimodality. Addresses limitations of standard RL methods.

- Demonstrated extreme agility and versatility for bipedal parkour and diving using a single OGMP policy per task. Policies generalize across wide variations of leaps, jumps, flips.

- Introduced novel latent mode space reachability analysis to characterize multimodal policy's versatility using feasible mode set computations. Quantifies generalization in and out of training domain.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled approach for robot learning that synergistically combines priors and multimodality to enable agile, generalizable policies without needing extensive reward engineering or demonstrations.
