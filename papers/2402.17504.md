# [Real-Time Estimation of Relative Pose for UAVs Using a Dual-Channel   Feature Association](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Achieving real-time relative pose estimation between multiple UAVs using onboard cameras is challenging. The key steps are high-rate cross-camera feature association and frame-rate relative pose estimation. However, existing methods for feature detection and matching are too slow to achieve frame-rate performance on resource-constrained onboard computers. The delay in feature association degrades the real-time performance and accuracy of the back-end estimator. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a dual-channel structure to accelerate cross-camera feature association to match the frame rate of the image stream. The guidance channel performs feature detection and matching periodically using SuperPoint and SuperGlue. The prediction channel tracks and predicts the feature matches to current frames using Lucas-Kanade optical flow. This decouples time-consuming feature extraction from the high-rate image stream and utilizes previously skipped frames. 

An MSCKF-based back-end fuses visual-inertial odometry from the two UAVs with measurements of common features to estimate the relative pose in real-time. It is redesigned for multi-UAV scenario with relative state initialization, propagation, update and landmark initialization.

Main Contributions:
1) A dual-channel feature association method that achieves frame-rate performance by periodic guidance and fast prediction, improving from 13Hz to 30Hz using SuperPoint+SuperGlue on an NVIDIA NX.

2) An MSCKF-based relative pose estimator that fuses local visual-inertial odometry and common feature observations. The high-rate feature association enhances its real-time performance.

3) Real-world experiments that validate the dual-channel algorithm's superior runtime over previous methods and the accurate relative pose estimation of the back-end system.
