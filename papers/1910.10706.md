# [KnowIT VQA: Answering Knowledge-Based Questions about Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10706)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the central research question of this paper is:

How can we develop an effective video understanding model that incorporates both visual information from the video content as well as background knowledge needed to answer complex natural language questions about the video?

The key hypothesis appears to be that fusing multi-modal video representations (visual, textual, temporal) with external knowledge will allow for answering more complex video questions that require reasoning beyond just the visual content. 

Specifically, the paper introduces a new video question answering dataset called KnowIT VQA that contains knowledge-based questions on video clips that require knowledge of the broader context/plot to answer correctly. The paper then proposes a model called ROCK that retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge base and fuses it with visual and textual features from the video to answer the complex questions. The central research direction is developing and evaluating this knowledge-enabled video QA model on their new benchmark dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing KnowIT VQA, a new video question answering dataset that combines visual, textual, temporal, and knowledge-based reasoning. The dataset contains over 24,000 human-generated question-answer pairs about the TV show The Big Bang Theory. 

2. Proposing a video understanding model called ROCK that retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge base and fuses it with visual and textual features from the video to predict answers. 

3. Demonstrating through experiments that incorporating external knowledge provides significant improvements in video QA performance on KnowIT VQA compared to methods that just use the visual and textual content.

4. Showing that there is still a large gap between the performance of the proposed ROCK model and human accuracy on KnowIT VQA, indicating it is a challenging benchmark that can encourage further progress in video and knowledge-based reasoning.

In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of a new knowledge-based video QA dataset, along with a proposed model that retrieves and reasons over external knowledge to answer questions that require real-world understanding beyond just the visual content. The work highlights the importance of knowledge in video QA and provides a challenging benchmark for future research in this area.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper introduces KnowIT VQA, a new video question answering dataset requiring knowledge about the show to answer real-world natural language questions, along with a proposed model that retrieves relevant knowledge and fuses it with video and text representations to reason about the questions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in knowledge-based visual question answering:

- It introduces a new video dataset (KnowIT VQA) for studying knowledge-based VQA, which is the first such dataset based on videos rather than static images. This allows probing questions that require temporal reasoning in addition to external knowledge.

- Most prior work in knowledge-based VQA relies on structured knowledge bases. This paper takes a different approach of using natural language descriptions as the knowledge source, which better fits the open-domain nature of the questions.

- The proposed model incorporates a knowledge retrieval module to find relevant knowledge from a pool of unstructured text. This is more flexible than methods that query knowledge bases, but may require more training data to learn effective retrieval.

- Evaluation shows substantial gains from incorporating retrieved knowledge, demonstrating the value of knowledge-based reasoning. But performance still lags well behind human accuracy, suggesting room for improvement in knowledge modeling.

- Compared to concurrent work like FVQA and OK-VQA, KnowIT VQA appears more challenging due to its video domain and less constrained question types.

In summary, this paper makes a solid contribution in pushing VQA capabilities by combining external knowledge with complex video data. The introduced dataset and models open up new research directions in knowledge-based video understanding. More work is still needed to achieve human-level proficiency on this challenging task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the knowledge retrieval module, such as by developing methods to automatically extract relevant knowledge from watching the video content rather than relying on human annotations. The authors note that using the ground truth knowledge labels leads to much better performance, suggesting room for improvement in knowledge retrieval.

- Exploring different visual features and fusion methods for encoding the video content. The paper tested different visual features like image features, concepts, facial features etc. but performance using just visual features lags behind human accuracy. Developing better video representations could improve results.

- Applying the framework to other video domains beyond just sitcoms. The authors propose sitcoms as a good testbed for studying knowledge-based VQA, but suggest expanding to other types of videos as future work.

- Studying how to acquire, represent and incorporate knowledge in a more structured format using knowledge graphs instead of natural language sentences. The current knowledge base uses free-form natural language which may limit reasoning ability.

- Evaluating on more complex forms of reasoning beyond multi-choice prediction, such as generation based tasks. Multi-choice was used as a first evaluation paradigm but richer reasoning could be explored.

- Developing datasets that require deeper temporal reasoning or causal reasoning, since the current work focuses more on knowledge rather than complex temporal dependencies.

In summary, the main future directions are improving the knowledge components, expanding the video domains and tasks, and developing more complex benchmarks requiring deeper reasoning. The paper proposes an initial framework but there is significant room for advancing knowledge-based video understanding.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video understanding task called KnowIT VQA, which fuses knowledge-based and video question answering. The authors introduce a video dataset called KnowIT VQA containing over 24,000 human-generated question-answer pairs about video clips from the TV show The Big Bang Theory. The questions require knowledge about the show as well as reasoning about the video content to answer correctly. To address this task, the authors propose a model called ROCK that contains two main components: 1) A knowledge retrieval module that takes the question and candidate answers as input and retrieves relevant knowledge sentences from a knowledge base built from explanatory annotations provided with the dataset. 2) A video reasoning module that encodes the video frames, subtitles, questions, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge sentences using BERT, fuses the visual and textual representations, and predicts the answer through a classifier. Experiments show that incorporating retrieved knowledge substantially improves performance on KnowIT VQA compared to methods that just use the textual and visual content, demonstrating the importance of external knowledge for video understanding.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem/question it is addressing is:

How to develop models for knowledge-based visual question answering in videos that can effectively incorporate external knowledge to answer questions that require reasoning beyond just the visual content of the video clip. 

The authors note that standard visual question answering models are limited in two ways:

1) They only use static image features, and don't capture temporal coherence in videos.

2) They don't have enough information to answer knowledge-based questions that require external knowledge beyond what is contained in the visual content. 

To address these limitations, the paper introduces a new dataset called KnowIT VQA that contains knowledge-based questions on video clips that require temporal reasoning and external knowledge to answer. It also proposes a model called ROCK that retrieves relevant knowledge from a knowledge base and fuses it with visual features from the video clip and language features from subtitles, questions, and answers to predict the correct response.

The key research contribution is demonstrating how external knowledge can be incorporated in an end-to-end model for knowledge-based video question answering, and highlighting the performance gap between models and humans on this challenging task.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper: 

The paper proposes KnowIT VQA, a new video question answering dataset that combines knowledge-based and video question answering. The dataset is based on videos and subtitles from the TV sitcom The Big Bang Theory and contains 24,282 human-generated question-answer pairs that require knowledge of the show to answer correctly. The authors argue that popular sitcoms like this provide an ideal testbed for knowledge-based VQA. The questions in KnowIT VQA cover four types - visual, textual, temporal, and knowledge-based. To model the knowledge viewers acquire from watching the show, the dataset provides knowledge annotations for each question. The authors also propose a model called ROCK that incorporates specific knowledge retrieved from a knowledge base along with multimodal video features to predict answers. Experiments show that incorporating knowledge provides substantial gains, with ROCK outperforming previous methods by 6.5%. However, ROCK still lags behind human performance, indicating the dataset's usefulness for developing better video understanding models. Overall, by combining knowledge-based and video QA, KnowIT VQA requires joint visual, textual and temporal reasoning.
