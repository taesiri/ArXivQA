# [Using Motion Cues to Supervise Single-Frame Body Pose and Shape   Estimation in Low Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Supervised deep learning methods for estimating 3D human pose and shape from images require large amounts of annotated training data. However, obtaining such data is labor intensive and restricted due to privacy/licensing issues. 
- Semi-supervised methods require additional information like 3D keypoints, silhouettes, etc which is also laborious to collect.
- Video-based methods require input sequences at test time so don't apply to single images.

Proposed Solution: 
- Leverage easy-to-obtain unlabeled video sequences to provide additional supervision at training time without needing more annotations.
- Take a pretrained network that estimates SMPL parameters from single images. Compute poses in consecutive frames and optical flow between them. 
- Enforce consistency between image optical flow and flow inferred from change in pose across frames. Use this as additional loss to refine network weights.
- Allows refining a poorly trained single-image network without modifying architecture or needing additional labeled data.  

Key Contributions:
- Novel semi-supervised approach to exploit temporal information in videos to refine a single-image human mesh recovery model, using only off-the-shelf optical flow.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised TexturePose method. Combining both color and motion consistency works even better.
- More unlabeled videos improves performance further. Can even use test videos.  
- Adding lightweight temporal context allows single-image model to exploit sequences at test time and approach video-based methods.
- Agnostic to network architecture. Consistently improves various backbone models.
- Key idea is optical flow provides better proxy for motion than flow inferred from poorly trained model, so serves as useful weak supervision.

In summary, they introduce an effective way to use easy-to-obtain unlabeled video data to overcome lack of annotated images for training single-image human pose & shape estimation models.
