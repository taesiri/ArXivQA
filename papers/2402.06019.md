# [Checking the Sufficiently Scattered Condition using a Global Non-Convex   Optimization Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of checking the "sufficiently scattered condition" (SSC) for low-rank matrix factorization problems with nonnegativity constraints, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). The SSC is a key condition that guarantees the identifiability/uniqueness of the solution to these problems. However, checking the SSC is NP-hard in general. The paper provides the first approach to check the SSC exactly for problems of reasonable size.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors formulate the SSC checking problem as a non-convex quadratic optimization problem with box constraints. They then use the global optimization solver Gurobi to find the globally optimal solution. If the optimal objective value is 1 and the optimal solutions are the standard basis vectors, then the SSC is satisfied. 

The workflow is:
1) Check a necessary condition (NC-SSC) which can be done efficiently
2) Formulate the SSC checking as a quadratic optimization problem
3) Modify the formulation to have box constraints so that Gurobi can be applied
4) Use Gurobi to solve the problem globally. If optimal value > 1 then SSC violated. If optimal value = 1, check optimal solutions.

Key Contributions:
- First approach to check SSC exactly, up to machine precision
- Reformulation of SSC checking as a non-convex quadratic program with box constraints so that global solvers like Gurobi can be leveraged
- Evaluation on synthetic and real-world hyperspectral image data showing the approach can handle problems with factorization ranks around 10-20
- Guaranteed identifiability of NMF solutions for hyperspectral images

The proposed approach makes it possible, for the first time, to provide guarantees on the identifiability of solutions to nonnegativity-constrained matrix factorization problems on real datasets. This has significant implications for the interpretability of the solutions.
