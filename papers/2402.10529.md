# [Energy-aware Multi-UAV Coverage Mission Planning with Optimal Speed of   Flight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10529)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of energy-aware multi-UAV coverage path planning (mCPP). Existing mCPP methods aim to minimize path length, but this does not directly translate to minimum energy consumption. Moreover, they do not account for battery capacity constraints during planning. The authors argue that optimizing energy consumption is crucial for applications with limited flight time. However, estimating energy consumption during planning is challenging.

Solution:
The authors propose a new boustrophedon decomposition-based mCPP method that:
1) Uses the optimal speed for energy-efficient coverage trajectories. 
2) Employs a fast algorithm to estimate trajectory energy consumption during planning. This allows minimizing energy and respecting battery constraints.
3) Formulates the mCPP as a Multiple Set Traveling Salesman Problem (MS-TSP) and solves it with a proposed heuristic.

The optimal speed calculation and energy estimation algorithms leverage an existing analytical method. The MS-TSP formulation assigns a node to each coverage trajectory within a sub-area. Edge weights correspond to inter-trajectory travel costs. The solver heuristically optimizes the max and average energy objectives.

Contributions:  
1) First mCPP method optimizing energy consumption by utilizing optimal speed.
2) Novel MS-TSP representation enabling energy minimization under battery constraints.
3) Fast energy estimation technique enabling online energy-aware planning.
4) Experimental validation showing 40% energy savings over state-of-the-art methods and 97% energy estimation accuracy.
5) Real 2 UAV coverage experiment demonstrating system feasibility.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel energy optimization perspective to mCPP and provides practical algorithms leveraging it. The improvements in solution quality and planning speed are demonstrated in simulations and real flights.
