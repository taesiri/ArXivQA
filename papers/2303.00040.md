# [Towards Generalisable Video Moment Retrieval: Visual-Dynamic Injection   to Image-Text Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00040)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How can we exploit large-scale image-text pre-training models to benefit video moment retrieval (VMR) by learning universal visual-textual correlations, despite the limitations of image-text models in capturing video dynamics?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Large-scale image-text pre-training can provide useful universal visual-textual correlations that could aid VMR, if the limitations in capturing video dynamics can be addressed.2) Injecting visual context and spatial dynamic information into the text embeddings can make image-text models more sensitive to video changes and dynamics. 3) By injecting visual and dynamic information with a focus on phrases describing video changes (e.g. verbs), the text encoder can be adapted to better align with dynamic video content.4) This visual-dynamic injection method can be integrated into existing VMR models to improve their generalizability to novel scenes and vocabulary.So in summary, the central goal is to take advantage of image-text pre-training for VMR, while overcoming the limitations in modeling video dynamics, by injecting relevant visual and dynamic information into the text encoder. The hypothesis is that this will enable more accurate video-text alignment and superior generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) to enable image-text pre-training models to better understand videos for the task of video moment retrieval (VMR). The key ideas are:1. Extract visual context and spatial dynamic information from video frames. 2. Inject this information into the text embeddings during training, with a focus on words that describe video changes (e.g. verbs). This makes the text embeddings sensitive to video dynamics.3. Integrate VDI into existing VMR models to take advantage of the correlations learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, while adapting the text encoder to understand video changes.4. Achieve state-of-the-art performance on VMR benchmarks Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions. Show notable improvements on out-of-distribution test sets with novel scenes and vocabulary.In summary, the main contribution is proposing VDI to address the limitations of image-text pre-training models in capturing video dynamics, and enable better video-text alignment for more generalizable video moment retrieval. The key novelty is injecting visual context and dynamics into text embeddings to make them video-change sensitive.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) that adapts image-text pre-trained models for video moment retrieval by extracting visual context and spatial dynamic information from videos and injecting it into the text encoder to make it sensitive to video changes and enable more accurate video-text alignment.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in video moment retrieval:- The paper focuses on adapting image-text pre-training models like CLIP to the task of video moment retrieval. Most prior work uses separate pre-trained models for video and text feature extraction. Using a joint image-text pre-trained model allows leveraging more universal visual-textual correlations.- To address the limitations of image-text models in capturing video dynamics, the paper proposes a novel visual-dynamic injection method. This injects visual context and spatial dynamic information into the text encoder to make it more sensitive to describing video changes. Most prior work focuses only on improving the video feature extraction.- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets - Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions. More importantly, it shows significant gains on out-of-distribution splits with novel scenes and vocabulary. This demonstrates the method's superior generalization ability.- The visual-dynamic injection framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing VMR models. The only change needed is adapting the text encoder during training. No extra computations are needed during inference.- The ablation studies validate the contributions of the key components of the method - the visual context and spatial dynamic injection losses. The comparative retrievals using static vs dynamic queries also demonstrate the improved video dynamics sensitivity.Overall, the key novelty of this paper is in adapting image-text models to effectively exploit their pre-trained correlations for video moment retrieval via targeted injection of visual dynamics into the text encoder. The strong results verify the benefit of this approach for generalization.
