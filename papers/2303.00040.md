# [Towards Generalisable Video Moment Retrieval: Visual-Dynamic Injection   to Image-Text Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00040)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:How can we exploit large-scale image-text pre-training models to benefit video moment retrieval (VMR) by learning universal visual-textual correlations, despite the limitations of image-text models in capturing video dynamics?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Large-scale image-text pre-training can provide useful universal visual-textual correlations that could aid VMR, if the limitations in capturing video dynamics can be addressed.2) Injecting visual context and spatial dynamic information into the text embeddings can make image-text models more sensitive to video changes and dynamics. 3) By injecting visual and dynamic information with a focus on phrases describing video changes (e.g. verbs), the text encoder can be adapted to better align with dynamic video content.4) This visual-dynamic injection method can be integrated into existing VMR models to improve their generalizability to novel scenes and vocabulary.So in summary, the central goal is to take advantage of image-text pre-training for VMR, while overcoming the limitations in modeling video dynamics, by injecting relevant visual and dynamic information into the text encoder. The hypothesis is that this will enable more accurate video-text alignment and superior generalization ability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) to enable image-text pre-training models to better understand videos for the task of video moment retrieval (VMR). The key ideas are:1. Extract visual context and spatial dynamic information from video frames. 2. Inject this information into the text embeddings during training, with a focus on words that describe video changes (e.g. verbs). This makes the text embeddings sensitive to video dynamics.3. Integrate VDI into existing VMR models to take advantage of the correlations learned from large-scale image-text pre-training, while adapting the text encoder to understand video changes.4. Achieve state-of-the-art performance on VMR benchmarks Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions. Show notable improvements on out-of-distribution test sets with novel scenes and vocabulary.In summary, the main contribution is proposing VDI to address the limitations of image-text pre-training models in capturing video dynamics, and enable better video-text alignment for more generalizable video moment retrieval. The key novelty is injecting visual context and dynamics into text embeddings to make them video-change sensitive.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) that adapts image-text pre-trained models for video moment retrieval by extracting visual context and spatial dynamic information from videos and injecting it into the text encoder to make it sensitive to video changes and enable more accurate video-text alignment.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in video moment retrieval:- The paper focuses on adapting image-text pre-training models like CLIP to the task of video moment retrieval. Most prior work uses separate pre-trained models for video and text feature extraction. Using a joint image-text pre-trained model allows leveraging more universal visual-textual correlations.- To address the limitations of image-text models in capturing video dynamics, the paper proposes a novel visual-dynamic injection method. This injects visual context and spatial dynamic information into the text encoder to make it more sensitive to describing video changes. Most prior work focuses only on improving the video feature extraction.- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets - Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions. More importantly, it shows significant gains on out-of-distribution splits with novel scenes and vocabulary. This demonstrates the method's superior generalization ability.- The visual-dynamic injection framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing VMR models. The only change needed is adapting the text encoder during training. No extra computations are needed during inference.- The ablation studies validate the contributions of the key components of the method - the visual context and spatial dynamic injection losses. The comparative retrievals using static vs dynamic queries also demonstrate the improved video dynamics sensitivity.Overall, the key novelty of this paper is in adapting image-text models to effectively exploit their pre-trained correlations for video moment retrieval via targeted injection of visual dynamics into the text encoder. The strong results verify the benefit of this approach for generalization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more robust and generalizable video moment retrieval methods. The authors suggest exploring ways to better transfer image-text pre-training models like CLIP to the video domain while retaining their alignment capabilities. This includes finding better ways to inject visual context and dynamics into the text encoder.- Improving video change modeling. The paper introduces visual context and spatial dynamic injection as a way to make image-text models more sensitive to video changes. The authors suggest further exploring this direction, such as using different sequence modeling techniques for the spatial dynamics.- Applying VDI to other VMR frameworks. The VDI approach is model-agnostic, so the authors suggest integrating it into other state-of-the-art VMR frameworks beyond just the MMN model used in this work.- Exploring different pre-training objectives. The authors used a standard contrastive learning objective for pre-training, but suggest exploring other objectives that may produce better video-text alignment capabilities.- More comprehensive evaluations. The authors evaluated VDI on two datasets, but suggest more extensive testing on a wider variety of video moment retrieval benchmarks. They also suggest evaluating on more diverse out-of-distribution test sets.- Real-world applications. The authors propose applying video moment retrieval to real-world uses like human-computer interaction and surveillance. Testing VDI in these applied settings is suggested.In general, the main future directions are improving the video-text alignment modeling, enhancing the generalizability, and expanding the applications of video moment retrieval methods like the VDI approach proposed in this work. More robust video change modeling and transfer learning from large image-text datasets seem to be the core recommended focuses.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:This CVPR 2023 paper proposes a method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) to enable generalizable video moment retrieval (VMR) by leveraging image-text pre-trained models like CLIP. The key insight is that image-text pre-training overlooks temporal changes in videos and the words that describe those changes. So the authors propose to extract visual context and spatial dynamic information from videos and inject it into the text encoder, with a focus on phrases that describe change (e.g. verbs). This makes the text embeddings sensitive to video dynamics. VDI can be integrated into existing VMR models like MMN with no extra compute at inference time. Experiments on Charades-STA and ActivityNet show VDI achieves state-of-the-art VMR performance, especially on out-of-distribution splits with novel scenes and vocabulary. This demonstrates VDI's ability to adapt image-text pre-training to video tasks requiring fine-grained vision-language alignment. The main contributions are: (1) novel visual-dynamic injection method to make image-text pre-training useful for VMR, (2) integratable formulation to benefit existing VMR models, (3) superior generalizability demonstrated by SOTA performance on benchmarks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) to enable generalizable video moment retrieval (VMR). VMR aims to locate a target moment in a long, untrimmed video according to a natural language query. Existing methods rely on separate pre-trained visual and text encoders which must learn alignments from scratch. VDI instead leverages image-text pre-training models like CLIP which have universal visual-textual correlations. However, CLIP is insensitive to video dynamics. VDI extracts visual context and spatial dynamics from video frames to inject into the text encoder, emphasizing phrases like verbs that describe changes. This encodes relevant visual patterns into text embeddings for better video-text alignment. Experiments on Charades-STA and ActivityNet show state-of-the-art performance, especially on out-of-distribution splits with novel scenes/words. VDI demonstrates adapting image-text pre-training for video tasks requiring fine-grained comprehension. Key ideas are probing visual context using static noun phrases, and enforcing consistency between spatial dynamics and dynamic verb phrases.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) to enable generalizable video moment retrieval (VMR) by leveraging image-text pre-trained models. The key idea is to extract visual context and spatial dynamic information from video frames and inject them into the text embeddings to align with phrases describing video changes (e.g. verbs). Specifically, visual context indicates scene backgrounds, object appearances, etc. and spatial dynamics capture location changes of salient entities over time. These are encoded into text embeddings matched to dynamic queries describing video changes through two losses: visual context injection aligns dynamic queries with visual context-enriched static queries, and spatial dynamic injection enforces consistency between video and text spatial dynamics. By adapting the text encoder this way, video-text alignments become more accurate for arbitrary scenes and vocabulary. The VDI method can be integrated into existing VMR models with no extra inference cost. Experiments on Charades-STA and ActivityNet show VDI enables state-of-the-art VMR, especially for out-of-distribution generalization.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of building generalizable video moment retrieval (VMR) models that can locate video moments described by natural language queries. Specifically, it aims to tackle two key challenges:1) Lack of sufficient temporal boundary annotations for training VMR models from scratch. Existing methods rely on pre-trained visual and textual encoders, but it is difficult to align these modalities well without a large labeled VMR dataset. 2) Limitations of using pre-trained image-text models for VMR. While image-text models (e.g. CLIP) learn strong visual representations, they are insensitive to temporal changes in videos and the words describing those changes. Directly applying them to VMR is suboptimal.To address these issues, the paper proposes a method called Visual-Dynamic Injection (VDI) that adapts image-text models to understand video dynamics and enable more accurate video-text alignment for generalizable VMR.The key ideas are:1) Extract visual context and spatial dynamic information from video frames.2) Inject this information into the text encoder to make it sensitive to words describing video changes (verbs). 3) Transfer universal visual-textual correlations learned from image-text pre-training to VMR.So in summary, the paper introduces a way to adapt image-text models for fine-grained video understanding tasks like VMR by injecting visual dynamics, without requiring a large labeled VMR dataset.
