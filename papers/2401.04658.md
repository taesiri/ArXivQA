# [Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence   Lengths in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04658)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard softmax attention scales quadratically in computational complexity with sequence length, making it difficult to model extremely long sequences in large language models (LLMs). 
- Existing linear attention methods have theoretical complexity of O(n) but struggle in practice due to the need for cumulative summation (cumsum) in causal attention scenarios.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose Lightning Attention-2, which separates the attention computation into intra-block and inter-block components.  
- For intra-blocks, standard attention is used to compute QKV products. For inter-blocks, the linear attention kernel trick is used.
- Tiling techniques are employed in both forward and backward passes to maximize hardware utilization. The method is implemented in Triton to be IO-aware.

Main Contributions:
- Lightning Attention-2 is the first linear attention method that achieves the theoretical O(n) complexity in practice for causal attention, maintaining constant training speed regardless of sequence length.
- Experiments across diverse model sizes and sequence lengths show Lightning Attention-2 is significantly faster than prior attention mechanisms like FlashAttention-2, with reduced memory footprint.
- Analysis on the 15B parameter TransNormerLLM model shows strong performance on commonsense reasoning and multiple choice benchmarks, surpassing a 12B model.

In summary, Lightning Attention-2 enables linear attention to achieve its theoretical benefits, allowing LLMs to effectively handle unlimited length sequences with no additional computational cost, a significant breakthrough for modeling long sequences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Lightning Attention-2, a linear attention method that can handle unlimited sequence lengths in large language models without sacrificing training speed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Lightning Attention-2, an innovative linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits in practice. Specifically:

1) Lightning Attention-2 separates the computation into intra-block and inter-block components, using conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This allows it to avoid issues with cumulative summation in the causal setting that hindered prior linear attention methods.

2) Lightning Attention-2 adopts tiling techniques in both the forward and backward passes to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. This makes the algorithm IO-aware and hardware-friendly. 

3) Experiments show that Lightning Attention-2 maintains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length. It is significantly faster than softmax attention and prior linear attention methods, especially for long sequences.

In summary, Lightning Attention-2 is the first linear attention implementation that truly realizes linear attention's theoretical O(n) computational complexity in practice for unlimited sequence lengths, overcoming limitations of previous methods. This enables efficient training and inference for large language models on extremely long sequences.
