# [One-class anomaly detection through color-to-thermal AI for building   envelope inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02963)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Thermographic inspection of building envelopes is useful to locate energy efficiency issues, but interpreting thermal images requires expertise and is prone to artifacts. This makes the process labor-intensive, time-consuming, and difficult to automate with traditional algorithms.
- Applying AI/machine learning methods has been limited due to lack of datasets, need for labeling, and gap between building experts and AI researchers. Existing literature focuses on supervised deep learning requiring extensive labeling.
- There is a need for alternative anomaly detection methods that do not rely heavily on expert knowledge and labeling effort.

Proposed Solution: 
- Present a label-free anomaly detection method using aligned RGB-thermal image pairs of building facades. 
- Uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to predict expected thermal image from RGB, compares it with actual thermal image. Mismatches indicate anomalies.
- Network learns to identify features as normal/anomalous based on training data conditions. Demonstrated by training with different outdoor temps to detect thermal bridges.

Key Contributions:
- Method can overcome challenges like generalization, uncontrolled capturing, extensive labeling effort.
- Careful data preprocessing and training found critical for good network performance in RGB-thermal prediction.  
- Network qualitative performance seems better than previous literature.
- Changing training/testing conditions allows detecting relevant anomalies e.g. thermal bridges.
- Principle demonstrated, can be extended to other building envelope anomalies or combined with other methods.
- Can assist professionals during inspection or enable automation by deployment on mobile platforms.

In summary, the paper presents an AI-based label-free method to detect anomalies in building thermographic inspection by comparing expected and actual thermal distributions, overcoming some key challenges. It shows promising qualitative results on thermal bridge detection.
