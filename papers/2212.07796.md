# [CREPE: Can Vision-Language Foundation Models Reason Compositionally?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07796)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question being addressed is: 

Can existing large-scale vision-language models demonstrate compositional reasoning abilities? Specifically, do they exhibit systematicity (the ability to recombine known components to understand novel combinations) and productivity (the ability to understand increasingly complex inputs)?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Current vision-language models struggle with systematic generalization, and will perform worse when tested on novel visual concept compositions compared to seen compositions.

2) Vision-language models' ability to correctly comprehend scenes will degrade as the complexity of the textual description increases.

To evaluate these hypotheses, the authors introduce a new benchmark called CREPE that tests systematicity via seen/unseen splits of compounds, and productivity by testing on captions of increasing complexity. The experiments assess whether current models exhibit the expected deficiencies in these two aspects of compositional reasoning.

So in summary, the paper sets out to probe whether existing vision-language models actually demonstrate robust compositional abilities, or whether their strong performance on many downstream tasks may be relying more on simply recognizing familiar patterns. The introduction of CREPE provides a way to directly test models for these hypothesized limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces a new benchmark called CREPE (Compositional REPresentation Evaluation) to evaluate the compositional reasoning abilities of vision-language foundation models. The key contributions are:

- It proposes evaluating two important aspects of compositionality from cognitive science - systematicity and productivity. 

- It introduces large-scale datasets to test systematicity and productivity via image-text retrieval. For systematicity, it provides three splits to test generalization to seen compounds, unseen compounds, and unseen atoms. For productivity, it generates examples across 9 levels of complexity.

- It generates hard negatives for the datasets corresponding to different failure modes like ignoring incorrect atoms or improper binding of atoms. 

- It evaluates various CLIP-style models on these datasets and finds that they struggle at compositional reasoning, with performance dropping on unseen compounds and higher complexity.

- The benchmark and datasets are released publicly to facilitate future research on improving compositionality of vision-language models.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a rigorous benchmark to evaluate compositionality of vision-language models, demonstrating current models lack strong compositional abilities. The datasets and analysis provide a means to make progress on this important capability.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called CREPE to evaluate whether vision-language foundation models like CLIP demonstrate compositional reasoning, finding that they struggle at systematic generalization to novel compositions and understanding increasingly complex expressions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new benchmark called CREPE to evaluate compositional reasoning abilities of vision-language foundation models. Here are a few key ways it compares to related work:

- It focuses specifically on evaluating two important aspects of compositionality - systematicity and productivity - whereas most prior work has studied compositionality more indirectly. For example, some papers have looked at how well models can perform retrieval or question answering when there are distractors or variations in word order, but without explicitly measuring generalization to novel compositions.

- The benchmark datasets generated are much larger in scale compared to related prior work. For systematicity, CREPE uses 385K-373K image-text pairs from Visual Genome with carefully controlled splits to test generalization. For productivity, it generates 17K examples across 9 levels of complexity. In contrast, prior work like Winoground only had 800 examples.

- CREPE systematically generates multiple hard negative examples per image-text pair to better isolate compositional abilities. Other benchmarks often use the original dataset images as negatives, which can include false negatives. CREPE creates atomic, swapping, and negation negatives to target specific deficiencies.

- The paper evaluates a range of recent vision-language models (CLIP, ALBEF, FLAVA, etc.) pretrained on various datasets to study the impact of model architecture and training data size. Most prior work evaluates 1 or 2 model architectures. 

- The paper examines both image-text and text-image retrieval directions. Some related studies have only tested image-to-text retrieval.

Overall, CREPE advances compositionality evaluation by creating more comprehensive benchmark datasets, testing more models, and directly targeting systematicity and productivity. The analysis reveals limitations of current models and provides a benchmark to track progress.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Evaluating more vision-language foundation models on the CREPE benchmark as they become available. The authors were limited to evaluating certain architectures and algorithms that were openly released, so applying CREPE to benchmark emerging models will be valuable.

- Developing methods to generate counterfactual negative images for the text-to-image retrieval task. The authors lacked hard negatives for text-to-image retrieval, so generating hard negative images is an important direction.

- Using the hard negative generation techniques introduced in CREPE during training to improve models' compositionality. The authors suggest researchers could leverage their hard negative generation methods to create better training data. 

- Exploring whether larger model sizes could improve compositional systematicity, as the results showed the larger ViT-L-14 model performed better on unseen compounds. Scaling up models may be a promising direction.

- Studying whether changes to pretraining objectives could improve compositional reasoning, as the contrastive loss alone did not yield compositional models. New objectives tailored for compositionality are worth exploring.

- Developing datasets with different compositional languages beyond visual concepts to generalize the methodology. The visual concept language could be extended to common sense or abstract concepts.

- Designing compositionality benchmarks that do not rely solely on retrieval, to complement CREPE's methodology. For example, using generation or question answering.

In summary, the key suggested directions are evaluating more models on CREPE, generating hard negative images, using CREPE's data generation techniques during training, scaling up model size, modifying pretraining objectives, expanding the compositional language, and complementary evaluation paradigms. The authors lay out an important research agenda for improving compositionality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces CREPE (Compositional REPresentation Evaluation), a new benchmark to evaluate the compositional reasoning abilities of vision-language foundation models. The benchmark measures two key aspects of compositionality identified in cognitive science - systematicity and productivity. To evaluate systematicity, CREPE contains test sets parsed from three popular pretraining datasets (CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M) to test generalization to seen atoms, unseen compounds, and unseen atoms. To evaluate productivity, CREPE contains 17K image-text pairs across 9 levels of complexity, plus hard negatives. Experiments across 7 architectures and 4 algorithms find that despite massive datasets, vision-language models struggle at compositionality - models see performance drops between seen and unseen compounds, and retrieval decays with complexity. The results hold regardless of model and dataset size. CREPE provides a systematic benchmark to track emergent compositional abilities in future vision-language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new benchmark called CREPE (Compositional REPresentation Evaluation) to evaluate compositional reasoning in vision-language foundation models. Compositional reasoning, combining known concepts into novel combinations, is an important capability for both human vision and language. However, current benchmarks lack the ability to directly test compositionality in vision-language models. 

The CREPE benchmark measures two key aspects of compositionality: systematicity and productivity. To test systematicity, CREPE provides three test sets paired with training datasets of different sizes to evaluate how well models generalize to novel atomic compositions. To test productivity, CREPE generates image-caption pairs of varying complexity along with controlled negatives. Experiments on 7 model architectures find significant deficiencies in compositional reasoning, with performance decaying on unseen compositions and higher complexity. The results hold regardless of model or training set size. CREPE provides a rigorous test of compositionality to guide progress in vision-language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces \nameemoji{}, a new large-scale benchmark to evaluate two key aspects of compositionality in vision-language models: systematicity and productivity. 

To evaluate systematicity, the authors parse three popular vision-language training datasets (CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M) to identify the atoms (objects, attributes, relations) and compounds (combinations of atoms) that models have seen during training. They then create test sets with image-text pairs split into seen compounds, unseen compounds, and unseen atoms, allowing them to test how well models systematically recombine seen building blocks. 

To evaluate productivity, the authors generate a dataset of image-text pairs with varying levels of compositional complexity, as measured by the number of atoms in the text. This allows testing models' ability to comprehend novel inputs of increasing complexity. 

The datasets contain carefully constructed hard negatives to ensure the evaluation specifically probes compositional abilities. Experiments across 7 architectures and 3 training datasets find models struggle at both systematicity and productivity, with performance decreasing as novelty and complexity increase. The benchmark and analysis provide a rigorous way to track progress on this key capability.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper introduces a new benchmark called CREPE (Compositional REPresentation Evaluation) to evaluate compositionality in vision-language models. Compositionality - the ability to understand meaning by composing smaller meaningful parts - is an important capability for both human vision and language.

- The benchmark tests two key aspects of compositionality: systematicity (ability to generalize to novel combinations of known parts) and productivity (ability to understand increasingly complex inputs).

- To test systematicity, the authors create datasets based on 3 popular pretraining datasets (CC, YFCC, LAION) with different types of splits: seen compounds, unseen compounds, unseen atoms.

- To test productivity, they generate a dataset with captions of varying complexity levels (number of atoms) along with different types of hard negatives.

- The paper evaluates several existing vision-language models like CLIP on these datasets. The key findings are:

1) Performance drops on unseen compositions for systematicity. 

2) Performance decays with complexity for productivity.

3) No clear correlation between dataset size/model size and compositional abilities. 

4) ImageNet accuracy correlates with retrieval but not with compositional generalization.

- Overall, the paper demonstrates that existing vision-language models struggle with systematic and productive compositionality through this new benchmark. The datasets created could help future efforts to improve compositional abilities.

In summary, the paper identifies compositionality as an important but insufficiently evaluated capability and creates rigorous benchmarks and datasets to analyze this in existing vision-language models. The results reveal a deficiency in compositional reasoning that needs to be addressed.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper introduces CREPE, a new benchmark to evaluate whether vision-language foundation models demonstrate compositional reasoning by measuring systematicity and productivity. To evaluate systematicity, CREPE utilizes Visual Genome to create test sets that contain novel combinations of seen atoms, with hard negatives for popular pretraining datasets like CC-12M, YFCC-15M, and LAION-400M.
