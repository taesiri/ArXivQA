# [Variational Learning is Effective for Large Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17641)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Variational Bayesian methods for deep learning have shown promise for improving model uncertainty and other aspects, but it has been challenging to scale them to large modern neural networks. Popular variational methods like Bayes by Backprop (BBB) struggle on even moderately-sized problems. This has led to doubts whether variational learning can be effective for large-scale deep learning without sacrifices in accuracy or efficiency. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a new optimizer called Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) which is adapted from recent theoretical work to enable effective variational learning at scale. IVON uses a stochastic natural gradient descent rule with practical tricks for stability, such as damping and momentum on the Hessian estimation. This allows it to directly optimize the variational objective at a similar computational cost to Adam.

Main Contributions:

- IVON matches or improves accuracy over Adam in training large networks like GPT-2 (700M+ parameters), ResNets, and CNNs from scratch while providing well-calibrated uncertainty.

- It has a simple Adam-like implementation and computational overhead nearly identical to Adam, unlike prior 2nd-order variational methods.

- IVON enables new use cases by leveraging its learned weight posterior: improved finetuning and model merging for large language models, sensitivity analysis to identify influential examples, and on-the-fly validation by predicting generalization error.

- Extensive experiments on image classification, language modeling, model finetuning, out-of-distribution detection, etc. demonstrate broad effectiveness of variational learning using IVON on modern large-scale tasks.

Overall, through both theoretical adaptation and practical tricks, the authors show that variational learning can be highly effective for large deep networks, overcoming prior challenges that limited its scalability. The proposed IVON optimizer matches or improves optimization performance over Adam in various settings while also enabling probabilistic capabilities.
