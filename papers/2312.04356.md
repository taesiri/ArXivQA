# [NeuJeans: Private Neural Network Inference with Joint Optimization of   Convolution and Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04356)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes NeuJeans, a set of optimizations for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to enable efficient private inference of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key innovation is a nested encoding method for FHE ciphertexts that allows efficient convolution algorithms to be developed. By structuring ciphertexts to have local transformations corresponding to convolutions, costly rotations of data can be avoided. Further optimizations fuse convolution operations with the FHE bootstrapping operation. Carefully designed execution flows minimize expensive FHE operations like bootstrapping for various CNN layer types. Together, these advances enable NeuJeans to perform inference of complex CNNs like ResNet18 on ImageNet images in just seconds on a GPU server, providing strong confidentiality guarantees through FHE while inducing low computational and communication overhead for clients. Experiments exhibit over 5X speedups for convolution layers and 2X faster end-to-end ResNet18 inference compared to prior FHE-based solutions. The efficiency of NeuJeans brings practical private deep learning much closer to reality.
