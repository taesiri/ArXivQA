# [NeuJeans: Private Neural Network Inference with Joint Optimization of   Convolution and Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04356)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes NeuJeans, a set of optimizations for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to enable efficient private inference of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key innovation is a nested encoding method for FHE ciphertexts that allows efficient convolution algorithms to be developed. By structuring ciphertexts to have local transformations corresponding to convolutions, costly rotations of data can be avoided. Further optimizations fuse convolution operations with the FHE bootstrapping operation. Carefully designed execution flows minimize expensive FHE operations like bootstrapping for various CNN layer types. Together, these advances enable NeuJeans to perform inference of complex CNNs like ResNet18 on ImageNet images in just seconds on a GPU server, providing strong confidentiality guarantees through FHE while inducing low computational and communication overhead for clients. Experiments exhibit over 5X speedups for convolution layers and 2X faster end-to-end ResNet18 inference compared to prior FHE-based solutions. The efficiency of NeuJeans brings practical private deep learning much closer to reality.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes NeuJeans, an optimized solution for private inference of deep convolutional neural networks using homomorphic encryption that incorporates a novel nested encoding method enabling efficient convolution algorithms and execution flows, achieving up to 5.68x faster convolutional layer performance and enabling ResNet18 ImageNet classification in 6.34 seconds.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to Section 1.3.1, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) A novel "nested encoding" method for CKKS ciphertexts that enables efficient convolutional layer (conv2d) algorithms by supporting localized convolutions and element-wise operations within nested vector structures. This significantly reduces the computational complexity of conv2d.

2) A technique to "fuse conv2d with bootstrapping" that eliminates redundant computations required for switching between encoding methods. By merging parts of the bootstrapping process with conv2d computations, overall efficiency is improved.  

3) Optimized "execution flows" for applying the proposed techniques to full CNN models. This includes a decomposition method for downsampling conv2d to reduce bootstrapping overhead, and efficient scheduling of operations for various conv2d layer types.

4) An implementation and evaluation of the proposed methods. Experiments show up to 5.68x faster conv2d than prior art, and enable inference of complex CNNs like ResNet18 on ImageNet in just seconds. The techniques provide substantial speedups to state-of-the-art in FHE-based private inference.

In summary, the main contribution is a set of optimizations for FHE-based private inference of CNNs, centered around a new nested encoding strategy and associated conv2d algorithms. By jointly optimizing encoding, bootstrapping, and execution flows, much faster CNN inference is achieved.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables private neural network inference by allowing clients to offload the computation to a server while keeping their data confidential. However, FHE-based solutions still face significant performance issues, mainly due to the high cost of evaluating convolutional layers and the bootstrapping operation to reset the computation capability of ciphertexts. In particular, data rearrangement in convolutions and handling sparsely encoded outputs incur heavy overheads.

Proposed Solution (named NeuJeans):
The paper proposes a set of optimizations in encoding, algorithms, and execution flows of FHE for efficient convolution evaluation, reducing the costs related to data rearrangement and bootstrapping.

1. A new ciphertext encoding method called nested encoding is introduced. It allows efficient convolution algorithms by partitioning data into slices where local convolutions can be performed. This minimizes costly rotations during convolutions.

2. Convolutional layer evaluation is fused with bootstrapping operations to avoid expensive intermediate computations for changing encodings. The convolution kernels can also be merged with parts of the bootstrapping matrices since they share similar structures.

3. Execution flows are optimized for various convolutional layer types to reduce bootstrapping overheads. Notably, a decomposition method handles downsampling convolutions without producing sparse outputs that incur heavy costs for densification before bootstrapping.


Main Contributions:

- Nested encoding method for FHE enabling efficient algorithms tailored for convolutional layer evaluation

- Fusing convolutional layer evaluation with bootstrapping to avoid expensive intermediate computations   

- Optimized execution flows minimizing bootstrapping costs for different convolutional layer types and downsampling convolutions

- An FHE-based system called NeuJeans implementing the optimizations for private neural network inference  

Results:
- Up to 5.68x faster convolutional layer evaluation compared to prior art
- Complete ResNet18 inference on ImageNet images in only 6.34 seconds, 2.27x faster than previous best result

The paper pushes FHE towards practical private inference of large neural networks with significant performance improvements and negligible overheads for clients.
