# [Federated Online and Bandit Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17586)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies the problem of distributed online and bandit convex optimization against an adaptive adversary. The goal is to minimize regret over $M$ machines working in parallel with intermittent communication. First, the paper shows that when machines have access to first-order gradient information, collaboration provides no benefit - running online gradient descent independently on each machine is optimal. This motivates studying settings with more limited feedback where collaboration can help. For the challenging problem of federated bandit linear optimization, the paper proposes a novel projected stochastic gradient algorithm using single-point feedback that achieves better regret than non-collaborative methods when the problem dimension is sufficiently high. Going beyond linear functions, the paper analyzes a federated stochastic gradient algorithm using two-point bandit feedback. This algorithm attains optimal regret for high-dimensional problems, demonstrating the benefit of collaboration in reducing the variance of stochastic gradient estimates. Finally, the paper provides a clear characterization that connects the adversarial and stochastic versions of the distributed online optimization problem studied. The tight regret bounds derived in this work for both first and zeroth-order feedback bridge the gap between stochastic and adversarial settings for understanding federated online optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies distributed online and bandit convex optimization against an adaptive adversary, aiming to understand when collaboration can be beneficial with limited feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the understanding of distributed online and bandit convex optimization:

1) It shows that with first-order (gradient) feedback, collaboration does not help improve regret guarantees compared to just running algorithms like OGD independently on each machine. This is in contrast to the stochastic setting where collaboration helps.

2) It proposes a novel federated projected online SGD algorithm (FedPOSGD) for the problem of federated adversarial linear bandits that uses one-point bandit feedback. This algorithm is shown to outperform non-collaborative baselines in high dimensions.

3) It analyzes a variant of FedAvg/Local SGD with two-point bandit feedback for general convex functions, showing collaboration can reduce variance and achieve linear speedups in number of machines in high dimensions. This algorithm also attains optimal regret for federated adversarial linear bandits. 

4) More broadly, the paper helps characterize the space of distributed online optimization problems along the axes of stochastic vs adaptive adversaries and type of feedback, clarifying when collaboration helps or not. It makes progress toward bridging the gap between understanding of stochastic and adaptive settings.

In summary, the main contribution is advancing our systematic understanding of when collaboration helps in distributed online optimization with limited feedback against adaptive adversaries. The paper proposes algorithms for bandit feedback that match or improve on non-collaborative baselines.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel projected online stochastic gradient descent algorithm called FedPOSGD for federated adversarial linear bandits. How does the projection step in FedPOSGD help control the variance of the gradient estimator compared to prior approaches? What are the limitations imposed by this extra projection?

2. For the FedPOSGD algorithm, the paper shows a regret bound that has linear dependence on the dimension $d$. Can you modify or extend the analysis to derive a regret bound that is sublinear in $d$? If not, what are the obstacles in achieving a dimension-free or dimension-independent regret guarantee?

3. The regret analysis of FedPOSGD shows dependence on the heterogeneity measure $\zeta$, but the algorithm does not seem to explicitly try to estimate or adapt to heterogeneity. What modifications can be made to FedPOSGD to try to exploit heterogeneity for improved performance? 

4. The paper proposes a two-point bandit feedback algorithm called FedOSGD. How does the use of two-point feedback lead to a lower variance gradient estimator compared to the single point estimator used in FedPOSGD? What is the intuition behind why two-point feedback helps?

5. For smooth functions, the paper shows improved regret guarantees for FedOSGD compared to FedPOSGD. However, the dependence on dimension $d$ still seems worse than optimal based on lower bounds. Can the analysis be tightened to remove the $d^{1/4}$ terms? If not, what barriers prevent achieving dimension-free rates?

6. Both FedPOSGD and FedOSGD aggregate model updates in an unprojected space rather than the projected space. What is the intuition behind why this helps enable collaboration even with noisy gradient estimates? 

7. The regret bounds for FedOSGD show explicit dependence on the heterogeneity measure $\zeta$, unlike FedPOSGD. How does the two-point feedback estimator enable the algorithm to exploit less heterogeneity?

8. The paper focuses on the intermittent communication setting. How do you think the restriction on communication would change the behavior of the federated bandit algorithms compared to a setting with more frequent communication?

9. For what kinds of machine learning tasks do you think the proposed federated bandit (zeroth-order) algorithms would be most suitable? When would first-order methods be preferred despite requiring more information?

10. The paper identifies several open questions at the end. Which of those do you think is the most interesting or important to address in future work and why? What approach would you take to making progress on that question?
