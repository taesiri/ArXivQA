# [Exploring the Limits of Semantic Image Compression at Micro-bits per   Pixel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional image compression methods like JPEG operate by preserving structural information like pixels and frequencies. They work well down to around 1 bit per pixel (bpp).
- In contrast, semantic compression methods store concepts and relationships using natural language. By not preserving precise locations/sizes, they can operate at extremely low bitrates.

Method: 
- Uses GPT-4V to encode images into detailed text descriptions and DALL-E3 to decode text back into images.
- Progressively reduces description length to control compression rate down to 100 micro-bits per pixel (μbpp).
- Introduces "image reflection" method adapted from code generation to iteratively improve decoded images by identifying and fixing differences between original and decoded descriptions.

Results:
- Pushes semantic compression down to 100 μbpp range, over 10,000x smaller than JPEG.
- Quality drops gradually with compression rate. 100 μbpp captures only most salient concepts. 
- Reflection improves quality, especially at higher bitrates. Limitations include object orientations and independent region edits.

Contributions:
- First exploration of extreme semantic image compression limits using GPT-4V and DALL-E3.
- Introduced image reflection to iteratively improve decoding.
- 100 μbpp seems to be a practical limit for current AI capabilities at 1024x1024 resolution.
- Future work involves better decoding models and Variable-Rate algorithms.

In summary, this paper shows impressive semantic compression abilities using the latest AI, and suggests inherent limits around 100 μbpp for today's technology. The method is mostly proof-of-concept using public models.
