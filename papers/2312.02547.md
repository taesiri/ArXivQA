# [On Optimal Consistency-Robustness Trade-Off for Learning-Augmented   Multi-Option Ski Rental](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02547)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper studies the learning-augmented multi-option ski rental problem, which generalizes the classical ski rental problem in two ways: the algorithm is given a prediction on the number of skiing days, and there are multiple rental options with varying durations and costs to choose from. The paper makes significant progress in understanding the optimal trade-off between consistency (performance when the prediction is accurate) and robustness (worst-case performance) for this problem. For deterministic algorithms, the paper presents an optimal algorithm matching a known lower bound on the achievable consistency-robustness trade-off. For randomized algorithms, the paper gives the first non-trivial lower bound on the trade-off, and also provides an improved randomized algorithm. When the desired consistency is small, the algorithm's robustness matches the lower bound up to a factor of e/2. The algorithm uses a carefully designed probability distribution for randomization and proceeds in three phases adapted to the prediction. The analysis involves several delicate arguments. Overall, the paper narrows the gap between existing algorithmic upper bounds and impossibility lower bounds for both deterministic and randomized learning-augmented algorithms.
