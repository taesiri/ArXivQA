# [A Boundary Based Out-of-Distribution Classifier for Generalized   Zero-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04872)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to build an effective out-of-distribution classifier for generalized zero-shot learning using only seen class samples during training?The key points are:- Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to recognize samples from both seen and unseen classes. Using a gating mechanism to distinguish unseen vs seen samples can decompose GZSL into separate zero-shot learning and supervised classification problems. - But training the gating classifier is challenging due to lack of unseen class samples. - This paper proposes a boundary based out-of-distribution (OOD) classifier to address this. It learns bounded manifolds for seen classes on a hypersphere latent space. - By finding the manifold boundaries, unseen samples can be separated from seen ones without needing unseen samples during training.- Two experts are then used to classify seen and unseen samples separately.So in summary, the main research question is how to build an effective OOD classifier for GZSL using only seen class samples, by learning bounded manifolds and leveraging their boundaries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a boundary based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classifier for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL). The key ideas are:1. They learn a shared latent space for visual features and semantic attributes using Hyper-Spherical Variational Autoencoders (SVAE). In this latent space, the distributions of visual features and attributes are aligned class-wisely. 2. Each seen class is represented by a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution in the latent space. By finding the boundary and center of each vMF distribution, they can determine whether a test sample is projected into the manifold of seen classes or not.3. The proposed OOD classifier separates test samples into seen or unseen domains without using any unseen samples for training. It converts the GZSL problem into a conventional ZSL problem and a supervised classification problem.4. They incorporate the OOD classifier with separate experts for seen and unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel boundary based OOD classifier to simplify the GZSL problem, which does not suffer from the bias problem or feature confusion problem in previous methods. The core idea is intuitive yet effective.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in generalized zero-shot learning:- This paper proposes a new approach for generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) using a boundary based out-of-distribution (OOD) classifier. The key idea is to learn bounded manifolds for seen classes and use the manifold boundaries to separate unseen samples from seen samples. This is a unique approach compared to most prior work.- Most prior GZSL work falls into three main categories: embedding methods, generative methods, and gating methods. This paper introduces a new gating method using the proposed boundary based OOD classifier. - Compared to embedding methods, this approach does not suffer from the bias problem of projecting unseen classes too close to seen classes in the embedding space.- Compared to generative methods, this approach does not have the feature confusion problem of synthetic unseen features becoming entangled with real seen features.- Compared to previous gating methods, this approach does not require any unseen data or unseen class semantics during training of the OOD classifier. It only relies on seen data.- The proposed method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art results on several GZSL benchmarks compared to prior work. It performs particularly well when the test/train distributions are similar for seen classes.- The main limitations seem to be lower performance on datasets where the seen test/train distributions are dissimilar, likely due to inability to learn accurate manifold boundaries.- Overall, this paper introduces a novel and intuitive gating approach for GZSL that circumvents some key issues faced by other methods, while achieving strong results on several benchmarks. It represents an important new technique for this challenging problem.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Explore other methods to find the class boundaries in the latent space. The paper presents a simple thresholding approach, but more sophisticated boundary detection techniques could be investigated. - Improve the robustness of the OOD classifier when the train and test distributions are very different. The performance drops on CUB and SUN datasets where the train/test distributions do not match well. Methods to align the distributions or adapt classifiers could help.- Design better losses to learn a more discriminative latent space. The classification loss hurts unseen-unseen class association which limits the generalization ability. New losses that preserve more semantic relationships could be beneficial. - Combine the proposed approach with more powerful ZSL models to further boost the GZSL accuracy. Replacing the ZSL expert module with state-of-the-art models can directly improve the overall performance.- Explore the effectiveness of boundary based OOD classifiers for other generalized learning tasks beyond GZSL, such as open set recognition.- Investigate alternative probabilistic models beyond the von Mises-Fisher distribution used here. Other distributions may better represent complex multimodal data.In summary, the main future directions are improving the OOD classifier, designing better latent spaces, integrating with advanced ZSL models, and extending the idea to other generalized learning problems. There remain many opportunities to build on the boundary based OOD classification approach presented in this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a boundary based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classifier to address the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) problem. The key idea is to learn a bounded manifold for each seen class on a unit hypersphere in the latent space. By finding the manifold boundaries and centers for seen classes, unseen samples can be separated from seen samples. The model consists of two hyper-spherical variational autoencoders, one for visual features and one for semantic attributes. By combining the objectives of the two autoencoders with a cross-reconstruction loss and classification loss, the model aligns the latent distributions of visual features and attributes class-wisely. Each class is represented by a von Mises-Fisher distribution to easily identify class boundaries. The OOD classifier incorporating two experts, one to classify seen samples and one for unseen, decomposes GZSL into two simpler problems. Experiments on five benchmark datasets show the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a boundary based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classifier for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL). GZSL is challenging because the test instances can come from either seen or unseen classes, but training data is only available for seen classes. The key idea is to learn a bounded manifold for each seen class in a shared latent space. The latent space is built on a unit hyper-sphere using Hyper-Spherical Variational Autoencoders, so each seen class distribution aligns to a von Mises-Fisher distribution. This makes it easy to find class boundaries. The model is trained with visual encoder and decoder networks, attribute encoder and decoder networks, and cross-reconstruction losses to align the visual and attribute distributions. At test time, the classifier checks whether a sample projects inside the boundary of a seen class manifold to determine if it is seen or unseen. Seen samples are classified by a seen expert and unseen samples by an unseen expert.The model is evaluated on five benchmark datasets - AWA1, AWA2, CUB, FLO, and SUN. It achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on AWA1, AWA2, and FLO where the test/train distributions are similar. Performance is lower on CUB and SUN where test/train distributions differ more. The key advantage of the proposed OOD classifier is that it only requires seen class data for training. Experiments also analyze the latent space, impact of different loss terms, parameter sensitivity, and manifold dimensionality. Overall, the boundary based approach provides an effective way to separate seen and unseen distributions for improved generalized zero-shot learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a boundary based Out-of-Distribution (OOD) classifier for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL). The key idea is to learn a bounded manifold for each seen class on a unit hyper-sphere in the latent space. This is achieved by using Hyper-Spherical Variational Auto-Encoders (SVAE) to align the latent distributions of visual features and semantic attributes in a class-wise manner. Each class distribution is modeled as a von Mises-Fisher distribution, which allows finding class boundaries on the sphere. During testing, the cosine similarity of a test sample to class centers is computed to determine if it is within the learned manifold boundaries of seen classes or not. Samples falling outside the manifolds are classified as unseen, while those within are seen. The seen/unseen prediction acts as a hard gating mechanism to route the sample to separate seen and unseen experts for final classification. This avoids the bias and feature confusion issues of previous GZSL methods. The model is trained using only seen class data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.
