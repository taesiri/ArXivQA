# [System-level Safety Guard: Safe Tracking Control through Uncertain   Neural Network Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers using neural networks (NNs) as predictive models for tracking control of unknown dynamical systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Two key challenges are addressed: (1) NNs have intrinsic uncertainties due to being black-box approximators; (2) There are extrinsic uncertainties from other modules like sensing and actuation that affect the inputs to the NN model. Ensuring safety under these uncertainties is difficult but crucial for deploying NNs modularly in safety-critical systems.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formulates a robust constrained tracking problem to follow a reference trajectory while obeying state constraints. It proposes solving this using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The key ideas are:
(1) Model the intrinsic NN uncertainties by assuming bounded prediction errors. 
(2) Propagate the extrinsic uncertainties from sensing/actuation as intervals through the NN layers analytically.
(3) Encode the activation uncertainties of NN neurons as binary variables in MILP.
(4) Compute robust state bounds that contain all possible behaviors.
(5) Enforce safety by constraining state bounds to lie outside obstacles.

Main Contributions:
1) A method to design tracking controllers using uncertain NN models while providing formal safety guarantees by leveraging MILP.
2) Propagation of uncertainty sets through NN enabled by novel MILP encoding scheme. 
3) Guaranteed safety considering both intrinsic NN errors and extrinsic uncertainties from other modules.
4) Demonstrated effectiveness forcollision avoidance in robot navigation and vehicle tracking examples.

In summary, the key innovation is a MILP-based tracking control method that provides provable system-level safety by accounting for uncertainties from the NN model and other modules in the system.
