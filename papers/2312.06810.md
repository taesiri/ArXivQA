# [System-level Safety Guard: Safe Tracking Control through Uncertain   Neural Network Dynamics Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers using neural networks (NNs) as predictive models for tracking control of unknown dynamical systems, such as robots and autonomous vehicles. Two key challenges are addressed: (1) NNs have intrinsic uncertainties due to being black-box approximators; (2) There are extrinsic uncertainties from other modules like sensing and actuation that affect the inputs to the NN model. Ensuring safety under these uncertainties is difficult but crucial for deploying NNs modularly in safety-critical systems.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper formulates a robust constrained tracking problem to follow a reference trajectory while obeying state constraints. It proposes solving this using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The key ideas are:
(1) Model the intrinsic NN uncertainties by assuming bounded prediction errors. 
(2) Propagate the extrinsic uncertainties from sensing/actuation as intervals through the NN layers analytically.
(3) Encode the activation uncertainties of NN neurons as binary variables in MILP.
(4) Compute robust state bounds that contain all possible behaviors.
(5) Enforce safety by constraining state bounds to lie outside obstacles.

Main Contributions:
1) A method to design tracking controllers using uncertain NN models while providing formal safety guarantees by leveraging MILP.
2) Propagation of uncertainty sets through NN enabled by novel MILP encoding scheme. 
3) Guaranteed safety considering both intrinsic NN errors and extrinsic uncertainties from other modules.
4) Demonstrated effectiveness forcollision avoidance in robot navigation and vehicle tracking examples.

In summary, the key innovation is a MILP-based tracking control method that provides provable system-level safety by accounting for uncertainties from the NN model and other modules in the system.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming approach to design a provably safe tracking controller that leverages a neural network learned dynamics model and accounts for both intrinsic neural network uncertainties and extrinsic uncertainties from other system modules.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes an approach for robust trajectory tracking control that leverages a neural network learned model of the dynamics. The method accounts for both intrinsic uncertainties from the neural network prediction errors, as well as extrinsic uncertainties from other system modules like sensing and actuation.

2) The method formulates the constrained trajectory tracking problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that propagates uncertainty sets through the neural network and enforces safety constraints. It provides formal guarantees that the overall system can be kept safe considering all uncertainties. 

3) The proposed MILP-based tracking method is demonstrated in simulations of robot navigation and vehicle control scenarios. It is able to avoid obstacles and collisions while tracking a reference trajectory, despite uncertainties in state measurements, control actuation, and neural network model predictions.

In summary, the key contribution is a robust control method that uses neural network learned models and provides formal safety guarantees by encoding uncertainties and constraints into a MILP problem. The effectiveness is shown in robotic navigation case studies.

The paper discusses using neural networks as predictive models for trajectory tracking control of unknown dynamical systems. It considers both intrinsic uncertainties from the NN models themselves as well as extrinsic uncertainties from other system modules. The key contribution is formulating the robust tracking control problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that provides formal safety guarantees at the system level despite these uncertainties. This is demonstrated on tasks like robot obstacle avoidance and vehicle navigation using set-theoretical localization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes the uncertainty sets are hypercubes for simplicity. How could the proposed MILP approach be extended to more general uncertainty set shapes such as ellipsoids or polytopes? What additional complexities would this introduce?

2. How does the conservatism of the overapproximations made in the MILP formulation compare to other robust control techniques for neural network models such as abstract interpretation or barrier certificates? Could ideas from those methods help reduce conservatism? 

3. The complexity of the MILP scales linearly with the number of neurons in the neural network. For large neural networks, could the method be made more efficient by only considering certain subsets of neurons and ignoring others? How would this impact the safety guarantees?

4. What other neural network activation functions besides ReLU could be encoded in the MILP? Would using different activations allow for less conservative approximations of the reachable sets?

5. How well does the approach extend to neural networks with many hidden layers? Do deeper networks require approximating the reachable set propagation in a more conservative way to maintain safety guarantees?  

6. The paper considers a simple tracking cost function. How could more complex control objectives such as fuel minimization or comfort be incorporated? Would this require approximations to keep the MILP tractable?

7. What theoretical guarantees exist on the feasibility and stability of the MILP solution over long horizons? If recursive feasibility cannot be ensured, how could the method be modified?

8. How do the uncertainty sets for the neural network errors compare to sets derived statistically, such as based on dropout at test time? Could those methods provide tighter uncertainty estimates?

9. How does the approach handle model mismatch between the true system and learned neural network dynamics? Are there cases where safety could still be violated?

10. The method relies on assumed uncertainty sets from other modules like sensing and actuation. How sensitive are the guarantees to inaccuracies in these uncertainty set estimates?
