# [Advancing State of the Art in Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03735)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Advancing the state-of-the-art in language modeling is challenging due to difficulty reproducing results and integrating new models into ensembles. 
- Focus has been on developing single best models rather than complementary models for ensembles.
- Barriers exist for publishing new ideas unless they surpass current state-of-the-art as a single model.

Proposed Solution:
- Publish code, probabilities on dev/test sets to simplify adding models to ensembles. 
- Determine complementarity by seeing if new model improves ensemble, rather than best stand-alone performance.
- Promote diversity of ideas - individual models don't need to be state-of-the-art if enhance ensemble.

Key Contributions:
- Ensemble framework simplifies integrating new models. 
- Achieves up to 10% perplexity improvement on PTB, WikiText-2 and 103 datasets.
- Makes reproduced benchmarks available to test complementarity. 
- Shifts focus from single models to complementary models for better ensembles.
- Lowers barriers and promotes diversity of ideas to advance state-of-the-art.

In summary, the paper tackles difficulties in advancing language modeling by providing an ensemble framework to easily integrate and evaluate complementary models. This ensemble approach has yielded significant improvements on key benchmarks. Availability of reproduced results also lowers barriers for publishing new ideas, ultimately accelerating progress in the field.
