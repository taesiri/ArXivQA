# [Pre-training Vision Transformers with Very Limited Synthesized Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14710)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that the process of generating different instances for each category in previous formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) datasets can be replaced with data augmentation techniques. Specifically, the authors propose that instead of having multiple synthesized images for each category, a single representative image per category along with data augmentation is sufficient for effective vision transformer (ViT) pre-training. To validate this, the authors create two minimal FDSL datasets called 2D-OFDB and 3D-OFDB with only 1 image per category. Despite having only 1,000 total images, 2D-OFDB and 3D-OFDB are able to match or exceed the performance of previous FDSL datasets with orders of magnitude more images on various downstream tasks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that data augmentation can replace explicit instance generation in FDSL, allowing effective ViT pre-training with only a single image per category. The authors validate this through the performance of their proposed minimal OFDB datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing two synthetic image datasets for pre-training Vision Transformers (ViTs) - 2D-OFDB and 3D-OFDB. These consist of only 1 representative image per category, so for example 2D-OFDB-1k has just 1,000 total images. 2. Showing that pre-training ViT models on these tiny datasets with only 1 instance per class can match or exceed the performance of models pre-trained on much larger datasets like ImageNet-1k, FractalDB-1k, etc. For example, 2D-OFDB-1k gets 84.0% on CIFAR-100 compared to FractalDB-1k's 81.6% despite using 1,000 images vs 1 million.3. Proposing two data augmentation techniques specifically for fractal images - random patch augmentation and random texture augmentation. These boost the performance of models pre-trained on the proposed OFDB datasets.4. Demonstrating that OFDB-21k with just 21,000 images matches or exceeds ImageNet-21k with 14 million images on ImageNet-1k fine-tuning, while being 3.3x faster to pre-train.5. Showing that OFDB-1k outperforms state-of-the-art methods like IDMM for pre-training ViTs on small datasets, achieving 80.8% average accuracy on 7 datasets compared to IDMM's 77.4%.In summary, the key contribution is showing that ViTs can be effectively pre-trained on extremely small synthetic datasets with just 1 instance per class, if good data augmentation is used. This makes pre-training much more efficient.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a very efficient way to pre-train vision transformers using only a few synthesized images per category, showing it can match the performance of models pre-trained on datasets with millions of images like ImageNet.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research on pre-training vision transformers:- This paper proposes a very efficient pre-training approach using only 1 synthesized image per category, called one-instance fractal databases (OFDB). Most prior work uses much larger datasets like ImageNet-1k which has 1.28 million images.- The paper shows that with data augmentation techniques tailored for fractals, OFDB can match or exceed the performance of models pre-trained on ImageNet and other large fractal datasets with millions of images. This demonstrates the potential to pre-train effectively with extremely small datasets.- Scaling up to 21k categories, the OFDB models match or exceed the performance of models pre-trained on ImageNet-21k, despite using only 21k synthesized images compared to ImageNet-21k's 14 million images. This is a significant improvement in data efficiency.- Compared to prior work on training vision transformers with very limited data like ViT-2040 which uses 2,040 images, OFDB with only 1k images achieves better performance on various fine-tuning benchmarks. This pushes the boundary on how little data is needed for pre-training.- The computational cost of rendering the fractal images for OFDB datasets is substantially lower than previous fractal datasets that use multiple images per category. This improves efficiency in terms of rendering time.So in summary, this paper makes conceptual and experimental contributions demonstrating the potential to pre-train vision transformers with extremely limited synthetic datasets, greatly improving data and computational efficiency compared to prior work. The one-instance approach and tailored fractal data augmentation methods are the key factors allowing OFDB models to match or exceed much larger datasets with millions of images.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Improving the image representation while keeping object contours as an important perspective. The authors suggest exploring better ways to represent the images in the synthesized datasets, while maintaining the focus on object contours which they found important for pre-training vision transformers.- Outperforming models pre-trained on much larger real image datasets. The authors suggest their formula-driven supervised learning approach has potential to surpass models pre-trained on huge real image datasets like JFT-300M/3B and IG-3.5B, by further improving the synthesized datasets.- Exploring semi-supervised and self-supervised pre-training. The authors briefly mention combining their synthesized datasets with unlabeled real images in semi-supervised or self-supervised frameworks as a direction.- Studying if their findings generalize to other model architectures. The experiments focus on vision transformers, so studying if the effectiveness of pre-training with very limited synthesized images transfers to CNNs and other architectures is suggested. - Investigating if their approach can work for other downstream tasks. The paper evaluates on image classification, detection and segmentation. Testing if the pre-training approach is useful for other tasks like video, medical imaging etc. is proposed.- Reducing the gap between small and large dataset performance. There is still a gap in performance between models pre-trained on the small synthesized datasets vs large real datasets for some tasks. Reducing this gap is noted as an aim.In summary, the main future directions are developing better representations for the synthesized data, combining it with real data in semi-supervised/self-supervised settings, testing the generalization capability, and reducing the performance gap compared to large real datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a method for pre-training Vision Transformers (ViTs) using very limited synthesized images generated from mathematical formulas. Specifically, the authors create two datasets called 2D-OFDB and 3D-OFDB that contain only a single representative image per category, unlike previous approaches that use multiple instances. Through experiments, they show that ViT models pre-trained on these small datasets with just 1,000-21,000 images can match or exceed the performance of models pre-trained on much larger datasets like ImageNet. The key contributions are: (1) introducing the concept of one-instance fractal databases for efficient ViT pre-training, (2) showing they can match million-scale datasets with only 0.1% of the images, (3) demonstrating superior performance compared to prior methods for pre-training on limited data, and (4) proposing random patch/texture augmentation techniques tailored for fractal images. Overall, this work shows the potential for pre-training high-performing ViTs with orders of magnitude less data through the use of synthesized images and limited instances per category.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes a method for efficiently pre-training Vision Transformers (ViTs) using a very limited number of synthesized images generated from mathematical formulas. Specifically, the authors introduce two small datasets called 2D-OFDB and 3D-OFDB which contain only 1 image per category, compared to standard datasets which have multiple images per category. For example, 2D-OFDB-1k has just 1,000 total images but is able to effectively pretrain a ViT for image classification tasks. The key idea is that the multiple instances per category in other synthetic datasets can be replaced by data augmentation techniques like image rotation during training. Experiments show that ViTs pretrained on OFDBs achieve comparable or better performance to those pretrained on much larger standard datasets with millions of images, despite having only 1,000 images. For example, ViTs pretrained on 2D/3D-OFDB-21k, which have just 21k total images, match or exceed the performance of ViTs pretrained on the 14 million image ImageNet-21k dataset on ImageNet-1k fine-tuning. This demonstrates the potential to pretrain ViTs using extremely small synthesized datasets.In summary, this paper introduces a highly data-efficient method to pretrain ViTs using only a single synthesized image per category, rather than multiple instances. By replacing multiple instances with data augmentation techniques, the proposed OFDB datasets with just 1,000-21,000 images are able to match the performance of ViTs pretrained on datasets orders of magnitude larger. This opens up new possibilities for pretraining competitive ViTs with much lower data requirements.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a novel approach for pre-training Vision Transformers (ViTs) using only a single synthesized image per category. The key ideas are:- They introduce the concept of one-instance fractal database (OFDB), where each category contains just one representative fractal image generated mathematically. This is in contrast to prior fractal-based datasets like FractalDB which use multiple augmented instances per category. - They show that with proper data augmentation techniques during training, a ViT can be effectively pre-trained on OFDBs with just 1,000 or 21,000 images (for OFDB-1k and OFDB-21k respectively). The data augmentation includes proposed techniques like random patch augmentation and random texture augmentation tailored for fractal images.- In experiments, they demonstrate that OFDB-1k and OFDB-21k can match or exceed the performance of baseline datasets like FractalDB-1k, ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k for downstream tasks, despite having 1,000x fewer images. For example, with ViT-B, OFDB-21k pre-training achieves 82.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k fine-tuning, comparable to ImageNet-21k pre-training.- Overall, the paper shows that ViTs can be effectively pre-trained with very small synthesized datasets, as low as 1,000 images, using the proposed one-instance fractal database and tailored data augmentation techniques. This demonstrates the potential for highly data-efficient pre-training of vision transformers.
