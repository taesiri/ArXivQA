# [A Comprehensive Survey on Process-Oriented Automatic Text Summarization   with Exploration of LLM-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on automatic text summarization (ATS) techniques, with a particular focus on summarization methods based on large language models (LLMs). 

The paper proposes using a "process-oriented schema" to categorize ATS techniques based on the practical pipeline for building ATS systems. This schema consists of four main steps - data acquisition, text pre-processing, language/summarization modeling, and evaluation. 

For data acquisition, the paper summarizes commonly used ATS datasets and methodologies for constructing new domain-specific datasets, including techniques leveraging LLMs. For pre-processing, it introduces main methods like noise removal, POS tagging, stemming etc. as well as toolkits like NLTK and TextBlob.  

The core of the paper lies in the language and summarization modeling section. For language modeling, statistical models, word embeddings and pre-training based methods are compared. The summarization modeling techniques are categorized into extractive and abstractive approaches, analyzing respective pros and cons. There is a dedicated focus on summarization methods based on LLMs, which are revolutionizing ATS research currently. Various techniques like knowledge distillation, prompt engineering and fine-tuning are discussed for effectively using LLMs for summarization.  

For evaluation of summaries, the paper examines overlap metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, similarity metrics like BERTSCORE, as well as emerging LLM-based evaluation techniques. Finally, ATS applications across domains like news, scientific papers, blogs, dialogue are mentioned.

The main contributions of this comprehensive survey are - i) Adopting a process-oriented schema for categorizing ATS literature ii) Providing one of the first focused analyses of LLM-based summarization techniques iii) Updating the ATS literature survey, which had a 2-year gap since the last comprehensive review.

The paper concludes by discussing limitations of current techniques and suggesting promising future research directions in prompt engineering, domain adaptation and evaluation for LLM-based summarization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on automatic text summarization methods that follows a process-oriented schema consisting of data acquisition, pre-processing, modeling with a focus on recent large language model approaches, evaluation metrics, as well as applied domains as implementation of summarization systems in real world scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It proposes a "Process-Oriented Schema" perspective for surveying automatic text summarization (ATS) methods, which aligns well with real-world implementation pipelines. This schema covers data acquisition, text pre-processing, language/summarization modeling, and evaluation metrics.

2. It provides a comprehensive review of the latest large language model (LLM) based ATS methods. This is one of the earliest surveys focusing specifically on LLM-based approaches for ATS.

3. It delivers an up-to-date survey of the ATS field, bridging the two-year gap since the last comprehensive ATS survey. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art across the different steps of the ATS pipeline.

In summary, the key contribution is providing an exhaustive, current survey of ATS techniques, especially LLM-based methods, using a process-oriented perspective tailored for practical applications. This makes the survey uniquely valuable as a reference for ATS research and development.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a "Process-Oriented Schema" for categorizing ATS methods. How does this schema align better with real-world ATS implementations compared to existing categorizations that focus on extractive vs abstractive methods?

2. When creating new ATS datasets from scratch, what are some of the key considerations and tradeoffs between rule-based annotation methods vs LLM-based annotation methods?

3. For statistical language models, what are some of the key limitations of relying solely on word frequencies and distributions to represent text? How do embedding and pre-training based methods aim to address these limitations? 

4. What architectural modifications need to be made for pre-trained transformer models like BERT to adapt them for the text summarization task? How does the choice of encoder, decoder, or encoder-decoder impact suitability for summarization?

5. Extractive summarization models have advantages in accuracy but can struggle with conciseness and fluency. What techniques can be used to address these limitations while retaining the accuracy benefits?  

6. For abstractive summarization models based on RNNs, what are some of the key challenges that arise when summarizing long input sequences? How do Transformer-based models aim to resolve these challenges?

7. When using prompt engineering to enable LLMs to perform summarization, what are some of the risks and downsides associated with manually crafted prompt templates? What methods can automate and enhance the prompt design process?

8. What types of factual inconsistencies can arise in LLM-generated summaries, and what methods can be used to automatically detect or mitigate these issues?

9. While overlap-based evaluation metrics like ROUGE are most common, what are their limitations? What alternative metrics can provide other useful insights into summary quality?

10. What unique challenges arise when applying ATS to specialized domains like scientific papers, medical texts, or microblogs? How can models be adapted to these domains?
