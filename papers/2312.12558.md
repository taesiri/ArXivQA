# [Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Partial Dynamics Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of sample complexity (number of interactions with the environment needed to learn a good policy) of online reinforcement learning algorithms when some prior knowledge about the system dynamics is available. Specifically, the paper considers Markov decision processes (MDPs) where the state transitions follow an additive disturbance model of the form:

$S_{h+1} = f(S_h, A_h) + W_h$

where $f$ represents the underlying dynamics, and $W_h$ are unknown disturbances independent of states and actions. The goal is to develop algorithms that can leverage knowledge of $f$ to reduce the sample complexity.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an optimistic Q-learning algorithm called UCB-f that incorporates knowledge of $f$ in the following way:

- When an actual transition $(s_h, a_h) \rightarrow s_{h+1}$ is observed, the algorithm simulates fictitious transitions $(s,a) \rightarrow \hat{f}(s,a) + (s_{h+1} - \hat{f}(s_h, a_h))$ for all state-action pairs $(s,a)$ using the knowledge of $\hat{f}$. 

- The Q-update rule uses these simulated transitions instead of only updating for the actually visited state-action pair. This allows propagating information more efficiently.

- Optimism is introduced by adding suitable exploration bonuses to the Q-updates.

Main Contributions:

- If the true $f$ is known, the proposed UCB-f algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret without dependency on the cardinalities of state and action spaces, compared to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{SAT})$ for standard Q-learning.

- If only a noisy estimate $\hat{f}$ of $f$ is available, UCB-f can still learn near optimal policies using a number of samples independent of $S,A$, with sub-optimality gap scaling with the approximation error $\Vert \hat{f} - f\Vert$.

- If the approximation error of $\hat{f}$ decays as $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ over episodes, UCB-f regains the $\sqrt{T}$ regret scaling.

- The algorithm enjoys the same memory complexity as regular Q-learning methods.

In summary, the paper provides an efficient way to leverage prior dynamics knowledge in Q-learning without needing to model transition probabilities explicitly. This leads to significantly improved sample complexity guarantees.
