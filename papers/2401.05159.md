## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Skin cancer is a growing public health issue with rising incidence rates globally. Early detection is critical for timely treatment and improved outcomes. However, existing skin lesion datasets used to train machine learning models have various limitations like inconsistent quality, lack of diversity, small size, etc. 

- Acquiring large-scale high-quality annotated dermatoscopic data is challenging and current datasets may not capture the true distribution of skin lesions seen clinically. This can negatively impact model training.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called Derm-T2IM to generate synthetic skin lesion images using stable diffusion models. It is tuned on a small set of only 1400 images per class.  

- Text embeddings are used to control image generation based on prompts. The tuned model produces photo-realistic and diverse moles. Various sampling techniques are used to improve image quality.

- A large-scale novel dataset with 6000 synthetic skin lesions spanning malignant and benign classes is generated. Smart transformations like size/number variations are also shown.

Key Contributions:
- A customized text-to-image stable diffusion model (Derm-T2IM) tuned on limited medical data using few-shot learning and open-sourced.

- Novel large-scale synthetic skin lesion dataset comprising 6000 images with balanced classes and smart transformations.

- Validation via training CNN and Vision Transformer classifiers on a blend of real and synthetic data. Hybrid data training enhances model robustness and testing accuracy.

- State-of-the-art skin lesion classifiers, when tuned on the proposed hybrid data approach, achieve over 93% accuracy demonstrating efficacy of the generated synthetic dataset.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient strategy to create robust synthetic skin lesion datasets using optimized diffusion models. It overcomes limitations of existing medical data and can enable more rigorous algorithm development and model training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Adaptation and optimal tuning of stable diffusion models with as low as 1400 images per class for developing a customized dermatoscopic text to image (T2I) diffusion model (called Derm-T2IM) for rendering large scale synthetic dermatoscopic data based on user text prompts.

2. The tuned Derm-T2IM model is open-sourced to allow the research community and medical professionals to render more synthetic dermatoscopic skin lesion data as per their requirements.

3. A novel large scale synthetic skin lesion data with over 6,000 images showcasing various smart transformations is generated and open-sourced. This includes skin lesions of different classes, manipulating the size and number of moles, and rendering data on different skin colors.

4. Validating the efficacy of the newly generated skin lesion data by fine tuning vision transformers and end-to-end pre-trained CNN MobileNet V2 architecture with different settings. The performance of tuned classifiers is cross validated against real-world skin cancer datasets, achieving over 93% accuracy with vision transformers.

In summary, the main contribution is the development and validation of an optimized text-to-image diffusion model for generating high quality synthetic skin lesion data to aid skin disease research and diagnosis.
