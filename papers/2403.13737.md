# [EthioLLM: Multilingual Large Language Models for Ethiopian Languages   with Task Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown great success recently, but low-resource languages like many African languages are lagging behind due to lack of data and resources. 
- Very few works have focused on Ethiopian languages even though Ethiopia has over 85 languages. Existing multilingual models cover only 2-4 Ethiopian languages.
- There is a lack of benchmark datasets for various NLP tasks spanning multiple Ethiopian languages to facilitate research.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces EthioLLM - the first multilingual LLM focusing on 5 major Ethiopian languages (Amharic, Oromo, Tigrinya, Somali, Ge'ez) and English.
- Two model architectures are explored - encoder-only (EthioLLM) and encoder-decoder (EthioMT5). Three model sizes are evaluated - small, base, large.
- The paper compiles EthioBenchmark, a benchmark dataset for various NLP tasks spanning the focused languages. Tasks include machine translation, news classification, NER, hate speech detection, POS tagging and sentiment analysis.

Main Contributions:
- First multilingual LLM for 5 major Ethiopian languages and English
- Introduction of EthioBenchmark - first diverse benchmark for evaluating models on various NLP tasks for multiple Ethiopian languages
- Evaluation of models on existing and newly introduced datasets, with EthioLLM showing competitive performance compared to current SOTA models
- Open-sourced the models, training data, EthioBenchmark datasets and task-specific fine-tuned models to promote further research into Ethiopian languages

In summary, the paper addresses the lack of representation for Ethiopian languages in LLMs and resources by introducing the first multilingual LLM and benchmark tailored for 5 major Ethiopian languages across diverse NLP tasks. The open-sourced resources aim to fuel further research and close the gap for these low-resource languages.
