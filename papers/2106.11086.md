# [Analytically Tractable Bayesian Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11086)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions and research focus of this paper are:

- Proposing a new method called "Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference" (TAGI) for Bayesian deep learning that allows analytically inferring the weights and biases of neural networks. This is in contrast to most other Bayesian neural network methods that rely on approximation techniques like variational inference or sampling.

- Demonstrating how to adapt the temporal difference Q-learning framework commonly used in deep reinforcement learning to make it compatible with TAGI. This allows applying TAGI to learn the action-value function for reinforcement learning problems.

- Evaluating TAGI deep Q-networks on benchmark reinforcement learning environments and comparing its performance to standard deep Q-learning based on backpropagation. The goal is to show TAGI can reach competitive performance to backpropagation on challenging RL problems without relying on gradient-based optimization.

So in summary, the main research focus is introducing a new analytically tractable Bayesian inference method for neural networks called TAGI and demonstrating its effectiveness by applying it to deep Q-learning for reinforcement learning problems. The key hypothesis is that TAGI can achieve comparable performance to backpropagation on complex RL benchmarks while also providing the benefits of Bayesian approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

- Proposes a method called Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) for learning the parameters of a neural network using closed-form analytical inference rather than relying on gradient-based optimization like backpropagation. 

- Shows how to adapt the temporal difference Q-learning framework commonly used in reinforcement learning to make it compatible with TAGI. This includes formulating the expected value function and Bellman equation in terms of Gaussian distributions to enable analytical inference.

- Applies TAGI to deep Q-learning on some reinforcement learning benchmark environments, including Atari games. Demonstrates that TAGI can achieve comparable performance to backpropagation-trained networks while using fewer hyperparameters.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an analytically tractable Bayesian deep Q-learning method called TAGI-DQN. Here are some key ways it compares to other related research:

They suggest developing new Bayesian deep RL methods that can scale to these complex environments.

- Exploring different neural network architectures with TAGI. The TAGI algorithm presented could likely be applied to other network architectures beyond the simple DQN model tested. The authors recommend exploring how TAGI performs with more advanced network designs. 

- Comparing TAGI to other approximate Bayesian inference methods on RL tasks. While TAGI was compared to standard backpropagation-trained networks, the authors suggest it should also be benchmarked against other Bayesian neural network techniques on RL problems.

- Optimizing TAGI implementations for greater computational efficiency. The authors note TAGI currently has slower training times than backpropagation-based approaches and suggest optimizing TAGI's code/libraries for faster performance.

- Extending TAGI for more advanced RL algorithms like actor-critic methods. The current TAGI framework is limited to DQN-based approaches. The authors recommend expanding TAGI to work with other algorithms that use policy networks and multiple networks.

- Investigating the use of learned models to aid TAGI's analytic inference. The authors propose incorporating learned environment models to help the analytic inference process in TAGI, improving sample efficiency.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method called Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) for training deep neural networks through analytical inference instead of gradient-based optimization. TAGI involves two main steps - forward uncertainty propagation to build a joint prior between network parameters and hidden states, and a backward update step for recursive Bayesian inference from layer to layer to learn the weights and biases. The key advantage of TAGI is that it maintains analytical tractability by using Gaussian approximations and local linearizations, allowing it to learn network parameters without relying on gradient computations. 

The paper shows how TAGI can be adapted for deep Q-learning in reinforcement learning, by modeling the action-value function with a neural network and incorporating rewards and sequential states into the inference process. Benchmark experiments on LunarLander, CartPole, and Atari game environments demonstrate that TAGI-based deep Q-learning achieves comparable performance to backpropagation-trained networks. A key benefit is that TAGI requires substantially fewer hyperparameters than standard deep Q-learning methods. The results demonstrate the potential for analytically tractable Bayesian deep learning in challenging reinforcement learning problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a Bayesian deep Q-learning method called Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) Deep Q-Network (DQN). TAGI allows learning the parameters of a neural network using closed-form analytical inference rather than relying on gradient-based optimization like standard deep learning approaches. It uses forward uncertainty propagation and backward update steps to analytically approximate the posterior distribution over network weights. The paper shows how the temporal difference Q-learning framework can be adapted to make it compatible with TAGI. Specifically, it models the action-value function with a neural network and represents the value function as a Gaussian random variable. This allows reformulating the Bellman equation as a linear model with Gaussian variables so that network training with TAGI remains analytically tractable. Experiments compare TAGI-DQN to standard DQN with backpropagation and show it achieves comparable performance on Atari game benchmarks while using fewer hyperparameters.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Analytically Tractable Bayesian Deep Q-Learning" is addressing the problem of how to perform Bayesian deep reinforcement learning in an analytically tractable manner, without relying on gradient-based optimization. 

Specifically, the paper proposes adapting the temporal difference Q-learning framework to be compatible with a method called "tractable approximate Gaussian inference" (TAGI). TAGI allows learning the parameters of a neural network using closed-form analytical equations rather than gradient descent. 

The paper argues that existing Bayesian deep learning methods based on variational inference, Monte Carlo dropout, or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo are generally too computationally demanding to scale to large reinforcement learning problems like Atari games. Additionally, none of those methods allow for fully analytical inference of the neural network parameters.

By formulating a TAGI version of deep Q-learning, the paper aims to demonstrate that analytical Bayesian inference can achieve comparable performance to gradient-based methods on challenging reinforcement learning benchmarks, while requiring fewer hyperparameters.

In summary, the key question is how to develop a Bayesian deep reinforcement learning approach that is analytically tractable and can scale to complex environments, overcoming limitations of existing Bayesian and gradient-based methods. The paper proposes TAGI-DQN as a solution.
