# [Analytically Tractable Bayesian Deep Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11086)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main contributions and research focus of this paper are:- Proposing a new method called "Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference" (TAGI) for Bayesian deep learning that allows analytically inferring the weights and biases of neural networks. This is in contrast to most other Bayesian neural network methods that rely on approximation techniques like variational inference or sampling.- Demonstrating how to adapt the temporal difference Q-learning framework commonly used in deep reinforcement learning to make it compatible with TAGI. This allows applying TAGI to learn the action-value function for reinforcement learning problems.- Evaluating TAGI deep Q-networks on benchmark reinforcement learning environments and comparing its performance to standard deep Q-learning based on backpropagation. The goal is to show TAGI can reach competitive performance to backpropagation on challenging RL problems without relying on gradient-based optimization.So in summary, the main research focus is introducing a new analytically tractable Bayesian inference method for neural networks called TAGI and demonstrating its effectiveness by applying it to deep Q-learning for reinforcement learning problems. The key hypothesis is that TAGI can achieve comparable performance to backpropagation on complex RL benchmarks while also providing the benefits of Bayesian approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:- Proposes a method called Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference (TAGI) for learning the parameters of a neural network using closed-form analytical inference rather than relying on gradient-based optimization like backpropagation. - Shows how to adapt the temporal difference Q-learning framework commonly used in reinforcement learning to make it compatible with TAGI. This includes formulating the expected value function and Bellman equation in terms of Gaussian distributions to enable analytical inference.- Applies TAGI to deep Q-learning on some reinforcement learning benchmark environments, including Atari games. Demonstrates that TAGI can achieve comparable performance to backpropagation-trained networks while using fewer hyperparameters.- Provides the first demonstration that an analytically tractable Bayesian inference approach can scale to challenging reinforcement learning problems like the Atari benchmark, challenging the notion that backpropagation is necessary for training neural networks on large-scale problems.In summary, the main contribution is presenting TAGI as an alternative to backpropagation for analytically training neural networks, and showing it can be applied successfully to deep reinforcement learning problems like Atari games that are considered challenging benchmarks. This helps advance Bayesian deep learning methods as a viable alternative to current backpropagation-based approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes an analytically tractable Bayesian deep Q-learning method called TAGI-DQN that reaches comparable performance to standard backpropagation-trained networks on reinforcement learning benchmarks while using fewer hyperparameters and no gradient-based optimization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents an analytically tractable Bayesian deep Q-learning method called TAGI-DQN. Here are some key ways it compares to other related research:- Uses TAGI (Tractable Approximate Gaussian Inference) to perform analytical inference of neural network weights/biases rather than relying on gradient-based optimization like most other Bayesian deep learning methods. This is a novel approach not seen in other RL papers.- Shows that TAGI can be applied to temporal difference Q-learning to achieve performance comparable to standard backpropagation-trained networks on RL benchmarks like Atari games. This is the first demonstration that analytical Bayesian inference can work well on complex RL problems. - Compares TAGI-DQN to related Bayesian RL methods like MC dropout, Bayes-by-backprop, and VI-based approaches. Shows that TAGI is the first method that scales to challenging environments like Atari while remaining analytically tractable.- Provides a simple and well-principled way to trade off exploration vs exploitation in RL using Thompson sampling within the probabilistic Q-learning framework. Related RL papers use heuristics like Îµ-greedy instead.- Requires fewer hyperparameters than comparable methods based on backpropagation and gradient optimization. May be more generalizable and require less tuning.So in summary, this paper introduces a novel analytical inference technique for Bayesian neural networks and shows its potential for RL by achieving strong results on benchmark environments. The TAGI-DQN approach seems more principled and scalable than related Bayesian RL methods to date.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing more advanced and scalable Bayesian deep RL algorithms. The authors note that most current Bayesian deep learning methods have not been applied to large-scale RL benchmarks like Atari games. They suggest developing new Bayesian deep RL methods that can scale to these complex environments.- Exploring different neural network architectures with TAGI. The TAGI algorithm presented could likely be applied to other network architectures beyond the simple DQN model tested. The authors recommend exploring how TAGI performs with more advanced network designs. - Comparing TAGI to other approximate Bayesian inference methods on RL tasks. While TAGI was compared to standard backpropagation-trained networks, the authors suggest it should also be benchmarked against other Bayesian neural network techniques on RL problems.- Optimizing TAGI implementations for greater computational efficiency. The authors note TAGI currently has slower training times than backpropagation-based approaches and suggest optimizing TAGI's code/libraries for faster performance.- Extending TAGI for more advanced RL algorithms like actor-critic methods. The current TAGI framework is limited to DQN-based approaches. The authors recommend expanding TAGI to work with other algorithms that use policy networks and multiple networks.- Investigating the use of learned models to aid TAGI's analytic inference. The authors propose incorporating learned environment models to help the analytic inference process in TAGI, improving sample efficiency.In summary, the main future directions involve developing more scalable and optimized Bayesian deep RL algorithms using TAGI, benchmarking against other Bayesian methods, and expanding TAGI to work with more advanced RL techniques.
