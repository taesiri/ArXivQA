# [Cross-Lingual Transfer for Natural Language Inference via Multilingual   Prompt Translator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12407)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cross-lingual transfer learning aims to leverage knowledge from high-resource languages to improve performance on low-resource languages. 
- Simply applying source language prompts to target languages fails to capture language-specific characteristics. Manually designing cross-lingual hard prompts is labor-intensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Multilingual Prompt Translator (MPT), a novel framework to translate source language soft prompts into enhanced target language prompts.

- MPT employs a multilingual prompt translator to convert language knowledge in the prompt while retaining task knowledge. 

- MPT uses a multi-task learning strategy: (1) Original classification task on source language to learn task knowledge  (2) Cross-lingual alignment task on external parallel corpus to learn multilingual knowledge and optimize the translator.

- The optimized translator then converts the source prompt into a target prompt infused with both task and multilingual knowledge.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel and effective cross-lingual transfer approach via prompt translation to address limitations of prior arts.

- Introduces a multilingual prompt translator and alignment task to properly transform crucial knowledge in prompts across languages.

- Evaluates extensively on XNLI benchmark and outperforms previous methods by large margins, especially for distant language transfer. 

- Provides detailed analysis on model components and hyperparameters to give insights.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative prompting framework MPT that trains a translator to transform source prompt into an enhanced multilingual target prompt for advancing cross-lingual transfer. Extensive experiments verify its effectiveness.
