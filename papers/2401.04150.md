# [Two-stream joint matching method based on contrastive learning for   few-shot action recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04150)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Few-shot action recognition methods fail to adequately model action relationships and utilize multi-modal information. 
- Existing methods struggle with handling videos of different lengths/speeds and aligning videos with mismatched sub-actions.

Proposed Solution:
- A Two-Stream Joint Matching (TSJM) method with two modules:
  1) Multi-modal Contrastive Learning (MCL) module
     - Incorporates optical flow to model temporal actions
     - Establishes inter-modality mutual information between RGB and optical flow features using contrastive learning
     - Enhances motion patterns in RGB features
  2) Joint Matching Module (JMM)  
     - Ordered Temporal Matching: Uses DTW to align variable length/speed videos
     - Bipartite Graph Matching: Introduces concept of bipartite graph matching and uses Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to find optimal alignment between videos to address sub-action misalignment

Main Contributions:
- Introduces multi-modal contrastive learning to incorporate optical flow into few-shot action recognition
- Establishes relationships between modalities using contrastive learning for better video representations
- Proposes joint matching module with ordered temporal matching and bipartite graph matching to address multiple video matching challenges
- Achieves state-of-the-art results on Kinetics and SSv2 datasets. Ablation studies validate efficacy of proposed modules.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel two-stream framework to enhance few-shot action recognition by better modeling actions through multi-modal contrastive learning and handling complex video matching problems using joint matching techniques.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1) It introduced a multi-modal contrastive learning module (MCL) that incorporates optical flow information to construct temporal action relationships in few-shot action recognition. It establishes inter-modality mutual information between RGB frames and optical flow through contrastive learning to obtain better video representations.

2) It proposed a joint matching module (JMM) that introduces the concept of weighted bipartite graph perfect matching to address the issue of matching errors caused by video sub-action misalignment. It uses the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to find the optimal matchings between videos. 

3) It conducted extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets - Kinetics and Something-Something V2 (SSv2) - demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and achieved competitive results. Ablation studies also validated the efficacy of the different modules proposed.
