# [Mechanistic Neural Networks for Scientific Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Mechanistic Neural Networks for Scientific Machine Learning":

Problem:
- Understanding and modeling the underlying mechanisms and governing equations of dynamical systems from data is an important challenge in sciences. This is currently done manually by experts, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and limited by prior knowledge.

- Existing machine learning methods for modeling dynamical systems have limitations: Neural ODEs have implicit equations, SINDy is limited to linear combinations of basis functions, Physics-Informed NNs require assuming equation forms.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Mechanistic Neural Networks (MNNs), which contain Mechanistic Blocks that explicitly learn governing differential equations as symbolic representations from data.

- MNNs have two main parts: (1) a mechanistic encoder that outputs explicit symbolic ODE representations, and (2) a fast and parallel ODE solver called Neural Relaxed Linear Programming (NeuRLP) solver.

- The NeuRLP solver addresses limitations of traditional ODE solvers: it enables batch and step parallelism on GPUs for solving independent ODE systems, and supports learnable step sizes and conditions.

Main Contributions:  
- A new neural network design with Mechanistic Blocks that can explicitly learn interpretable governing equations and mechanisms from complex scientific data.

- A novel NeuRLP ODE solver that is fast, parallelizable, differentiable, and overcomes limitations of traditional sequential ODE solvers.

- Demonstrating versatility of Mechanistic NNs for tasks from equation discovery to forecasting and PDE solving, consistently outperforming specialized state-of-the-art methods.

- Showcasing Mechanistic NNs' capabilities for analyzing complex scientific data and automating the discovery of best-fitting governing physical mechanisms.
