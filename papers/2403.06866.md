# [QUASAR: QUality and Aesthetics Scoring with Advanced Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06866)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Image quality assessment (IQA) and image aesthetics assessment (IAA) are important but challenging tasks due to the complexity of human visual perception and subjectivity. 
- Existing methods have limitations in terms of reliance on human-crafted features, lack of generalizability, and need for task-specific training.  
- Recently proposed CLIP-IQA uses text prompts like "Good image" which introduces ambiguity.

Proposed Solution - QUASAR:
- A new data-driven, non-parametric framework for unified assessment of image quality and aesthetics without needing prompt engineering or tuning.
- Uses image embeddings instead of text prompts as "anchors" to define positive and negative samples more accurately.
- Flexible framework allowing different encoders and aggregation methods.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes superior non-parametric IQA/IAA metric that achieves new state-of-the-art results on 8 datasets, significantly outperforming CLIP-IQA and other methods without any tuning.
- Provides extensive analysis of 7 self-supervised models showing QUASAR's robustness and generalizability.
- Shows high human agreement is achievable even with limited anchor data, highlighting efficiency.
- Unified assessment of technical quality and aesthetics in a single framework.
- Moves towards bridging gap between parametric and non-parametric image assessment techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces QUASAR, a new highly effective data-driven framework for non-parametric image quality and aesthetics assessment that demonstrates greater generalizability and performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
