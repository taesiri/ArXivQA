# [FRAD: Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary   Classification Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14514)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel detection model called FRAD to accurately categorize three types of front-running attacks (displacement, insertion, and suppression) in Ethereum decentralized application (DApp) transactions. FRAD utilizes real-world Ethereum transaction data to train four machine learning models (Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Multilayer Perceptron). Comprehensive performance evaluation shows the Multilayer Perceptron classifier achieves the best accuracy of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60% in detecting the three front-running attack types. The results demonstrate FRAD can effectively equip Ethereum developers with specific countermeasures against each attack type, greatly enhancing DApp transaction security. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and exploring ensemble learning approaches to further improve detection performance. Overall, this research makes a valuable contribution towards mitigating front-running threats in the Ethereum ecosystem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FRAD, a novel detection method to accurately categorize front-running attacks in Ethereum decentralized applications into displacement, insertion, and suppression types using machine learning models to help developers adopt tailored countermeasures against each attack type.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose a detection model named FRAD, designed to detect three types of front-running attacks in the real-world Ethereum network: displacement, insertion, and suppression.

2. The authors utilize Bayesian hyperparameter optimization to enhance the detection performance of the FRAD model.

3. The authors conduct a comprehensive evaluation using four machine learning algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting classifier, Gradient Boosting classifier, Random Forest classifier, and Multilayer Perceptron classifier) on 9798 real-world transactions. They find the FRAD model to be effective, with the Multilayer Perceptron classifier demonstrating the best detection performance - achieving an accuracy of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60%.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an effective front-running attack detection model called FRAD, evaluating it on real Ethereum transactions, and showing the Multilayer Perceptron classifier has the best performance in detecting the three types of attacks.
