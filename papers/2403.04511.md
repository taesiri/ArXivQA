# [Uncovering the Deep Filter Bubble: Narrow Exposure in Short-Video   Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04511)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper investigates the "deep filter bubble" phenomenon in recommender systems, which refers to users being exposed to an increasingly narrow subset of content within their broader interests over time (e.g. seeing content about only certain sports teams within the broader interest of sports).  

- No prior work has studied this hierarchical narrowing of interests. Existing works focus on diversity across top-level categories rather than narrowing exposure within categories. 

- Understanding this is important to prevent undesirable effects like boredom and polarization.

Methodology:
- The authors use a dataset from a top Chinese short-video platform containing 400 million interactions, 400,000 users and 20 million items with 3-level hierarchical categories.

- They formally define deep filter bubbles using category coverage at each level over time as the metric.

- They analyze the evolution of deep filter bubbles over a 1-year period, overall and for different factors like categories, user demographics, and feedback types.

Key Findings:
- The overall filter bubble remains constant but its composition changes over time - the top-level bubble expands while the middle level bubble shrinks.  

- Younger users, females, and users from lower-tier cities are more susceptible. 

- Implicit feedback reduces bubbles while explicit feedback exacerbates it.

- The recommender system likely over-indexes on explicit feedback, exacerbating bubbles.

Main Contributions:
- First study analyzing the hierarchical nature of filter bubbles using coverage within broader interests.

- Detailed analysis over a year showing how deep filter bubbles evolve differently across levels.

- Analysis of how factors like demographics and feedback types impact deep filter bubbles.  

- Providing suggestions to recommender systems designers to alleviate issues.
