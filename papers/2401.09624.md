# [MITS-GAN: Safeguarding Medical Imaging from Tampering with Generative   Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent advancements in generative models like GANs have enabled highly realistic image generation and manipulation. While this has several positive applications, it also raises concerns regarding potential malicious use, especially in sensitive domains like medical imaging. Manipulation of medical scans can compromise diagnostic integrity and patient care. Existing solutions focus on detecting manipulations after they have occurred. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper introduces MITS-GAN, a novel framework to proactively prevent tampering of medical images by disrupting the attacker's GAN architecture. The key idea involves introducing imperceptible noise patterns to the input CT scans. This protects the images by disrupting the output of the attacker's GAN when manipulation is attempted, making it easier to identify tampered images.

Main Contributions:
- Tackles the critical and underexplored issue of medical image tampering which can have severe patient care implications
- Introduces MITS-GAN which leverages GANs to proactively generate tamper-resistant medical images with negligible visible artifacts
- Compares performance to state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates MITS-GAN's superiority in preserving image integrity against malicious attacks
- Establishes a strong foundation for future research focused on securing medical imaging systems and ensuring responsible use of generative models

The proposed MITS-GAN framework takes a CT scan and perturbation noise as input. The generator network produces a protected image which is then forwarded to the attacker's GAN model. A discriminator network tries to distinguish between real and protected images. A composite loss function, comprising an adversarial loss and MSE loss between the input and attacked image, is optimized. This process strengthens the tamper-resistance of protected scans. Extensive experiments on a dataset of CT scans demonstrate that MITS-GAN introduces fewer artifacts while being more robust to manipulation attacks compared to existing techniques.

Overall, this work addresses the critical problem of medical image tampering by taking a proactive approach focused on preventing manipulations. The introduced methodology and analyses contribute to ensuring reliability and integrity of medical imaging practices.
