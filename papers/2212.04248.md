# [Talking Head Generation with Probabilistic Audio-to-Visual Diffusion   Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04248)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:

1. How can we holistically infer all non-lip related facial attributes (e.g. pose, expression, blink, gaze) from audio input only, while maintaining accurate lip synchronization? 

The authors hypothesize that this can be achieved through two key steps:

(a) Learning disentangled lip and non-lip representations from pre-trained facial motion encodings. 

(b) Modeling the mapping from audio to non-lip representations using a novel audio-to-visual diffusion prior.

2. Can a diffusion prior effectively model the one-to-many mapping from audio to reasonable non-lip facial motions?

The authors hypothesize that a diffusion prior can capture the intrinsic uncertainty and diversity in mapping from audio to facial motions, allowing sampling of varied but realistic non-lip motions given the same audio input.

3. Can their proposed framework produce natural looking and diverse facial motions from audio alone, without requiring additional pose/expression videos as input?

The authors hypothesize that by combining lip/non-lip disentanglement and the audio-to-visual diffusion prior, their framework can generate plausible talking heads with accurate lip sync, natural head movements and facial expressions using only a reference image and audio clip.

4. How can the quality of synthesized talking heads be effectively evaluated, especially the naturalness and richness of non-lip facial motions? 

The authors propose new quantitative metrics like FID scores on pose/expression features and sequence naturalness distance to measure the realism and diversity of generated motions.

In summary, the core research questions address how to perform audio-only driven talking head generation through disentangled representation learning and probabilistic modeling of audio-to-visual mappings using diffusion priors. The hypotheses focus on the capabilities of this framework to produce synchronized, diverse and natural talking heads.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation that can holistically infer non-lip facial motions like pose, expression, blink, and gaze from just an audio input. This avoids the need for extra driving videos.

2. It leverages pre-trained identity-irrelevant facial motion representations, and further disentangles them into lip-related and lip-irrelevant representations using a novel orthogonal loss.

3. It introduces a probabilistic audio-to-visual diffusion prior model to effectively infer diverse and natural looking lip-irrelevant facial motions for a given audio segment. This helps address the one-to-many mapping challenge.

4. It provides comprehensive evaluations using new metrics to measure the naturalness and diversity of generated facial motions. Results show the method can produce natural looking motions without hurting audio-lip synchronization.

In summary, the key contribution is a complete framework for audio-only talking head generation, including disentangled representations and a diffusion prior to handle one-to-many mapping. This provides an improved solution over prior arts that require extra driving signals or treat it as a black-box mapping. The new metrics are also an important contribution for future work in this area.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation that can holistically infer natural-looking and diverse non-lip facial motions (pose, expression, blink, gaze) from audio while maintaining accurate audio-lip synchronization, through the use of a pre-trained identity-irrelevant facial motion representation and an audio-to-visual diffusion prior model.
