## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
3D visual grounding aims to locate a target object in a 3D point cloud scene based on a natural language description. This is challenging due to the unstructuredness of descriptions and scattered arrangements of objects in 3D scenes. Previous methods rely on implicit feature alignment between text and point clouds, but they do not explicitly consider the anchor objects mentioned in the description that provide context to locate the target object. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes DOrA, a 3D visual grounding framework with Order-Aware Referring. DOrA utilizes a large language model (LLM) to parse the input description and extract a referential order of anchor objects leading to the target object. It then processes this order with a series of Object-Referring blocks that attend to the visual features of the corresponding anchor/target objects and refine them progressively. To provide better supervision, a pre-training scheme is introduced to synthesize accurate referential orders and object labels.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes DOrA, a novel 3D visual grounding framework that leverages LLM to extract referential order of anchors for guiding the grounding process.
- Introduces a series of Object-Referring blocks that follow the referential order, attending and refining anchor/target object features progressively.  
- Designs an order-aware pre-training strategy to synthesize reliable referential orders and object labels for better supervision.
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on NR3D and ScanRefer datasets, especially under low-resource settings, validating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
