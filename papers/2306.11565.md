# [HomeRobot: Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11565)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a benchmark for open-vocabulary mobile manipulation that enables progress on real-world robot assistants?The paper introduces the "Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation" (OVMM) task, where a robot must navigate real-world environments to find novel objects based on natural language descriptions and move them to target locations. The key contributions aimed at addressing this research question appear to be:1) Defining the OVMM task, which requires integrating solutions across perception, language understanding, navigation and manipulation.2) Developing a simulation benchmark with diverse 3D home environments and a large set of objects.3) Implementing a real-world benchmark using an affordable compliant robot (Hello Robot Stretch).4) Providing baselines using both heuristic and reinforcement learning approaches to highlight the challenges of OVMM. 5) Open-sourcing the HomeRobot software framework to facilitate OVMM research across both simulation and real-world settings.Overall, the central hypothesis seems to be that by formalizing OVMM and providing benchmarking infrastructure, the field can make progress on real-world robot assistants capable of mobile manipulation in human environments. The paper aims to make the case for OVMM as a crucial next benchmark, while also highlighting the limitations of current methods.
