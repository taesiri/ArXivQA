# [Fairness in Algorithmic Recourse Through the Lens of Substantive   Equality of Opportunity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Algorithmic recourse refers to providing recommendations to individuals who receive a negative outcome from an algorithmic system on how they can take actions to reverse that outcome. 
- Recent work has shown that even if the underlying algorithmic system is fair, recourse itself can be unfair if individuals need to exert vastly different amounts of effort to successfully act on the recommendations due to differences in their initial circumstances.  
- There is a lack of formal definitions and metrics to evaluate the fairness of algorithmic recourse systems, especially those that account for the dimension of time, which is critical since recourse recommendations can become invalid over time.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes two new metrics for evaluating fairness in algorithmic recourse - "effort-to-recourse (ETR)" which quantifies the amount of effort exerted per successful recourse event, and "time-to-recourse (TTR)" which quantifies the time taken per successful recourse event.
- These metrics allow comparing the effort and time taken by different population groups to achieve recourse. Disparities in ETR and TTR are proposed as definitions of unfairness.
- The metrics are grounded in the philosophy of substantive equality of opportunity, specifically luck egalitarianism, which advocates leveling the playing field by accounting for differences in circumstances.
- The paper also proposes an intervention called Circumstance-Normalized Selection (CNS) which selects individuals while normalizing for population circumstances, and shows it can reduce ETR and TTR disparities.

Main Contributions:
- Formal definitions of fairness in algorithmic recourse based on effort (ETR) and time (TTR) disparities, grounded in substantive equality of opportunity
- Extensive simulation-based analysis showing the interplay between initial qualifications and effort over time
- Demonstration of how differences in initial qualifications lead to compounding unfairness over time
- Proposal and evaluation of the CNS intervention for mitigating identified disparities

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards formalizing, detecting and mitigating unfairness in algorithmic recourse systems through the lens of substantive equality of opportunity. The analysis of dynamics over time is a notable dimension absent in prior work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes new metrics for evaluating fairness in algorithmic recourse over time, grounded in substantive equality of opportunity, and demonstrates their use along with a proportional selection intervention via agent-based simulation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing two novel metrics for evaluating the fairness of recourse: 

- Effort-to-recourse (ETR), which quantifies the amount of effort it takes for individuals in one population to achieve recourse, compared to individuals in another population. 

- Time-to-recourse (TTR), which quantifies how long it takes for individuals in one population to achieve recourse, compared to individuals in another population.

2) Extensive empirical analysis of the interplay between initial qualifications and effort, conducted with the help of a flexible agent-based simulation framework. This analysis surfaces unfairness in terms of disparities in ETR and TTR across population groups.

3) An intuitive fairness intervention, called Circumstance-Normalized Selection (CNS), that is consistent with the normative grounding of substantive equality of opportunity. The paper reports results comparing this method to others, showing that it can successfully mitigate disparities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing new fairness metrics for recourse, empirically analyzing unfairness in recourse over time, and developing a method to mitigate identified disparities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Algorithmic recourse - Providing recommendations on how individuals can take action to change an unfavorable algorithmic outcome.

- Fairness in recourse - Ensuring that the process and recommendations for recourse do not unfairly disadvantage certain groups. 

- Substantive equality of opportunity - A philosophical doctrine that aims to remove morally irrelevant barriers and reward morally relevant effort in attaining desirable positions. 

- Effort-to-recourse (ETR) - A proposed metric that quantifies the amount of effort individuals exert per successful recourse event. 

- Time-to-recourse (TTR) - A proposed metric that quantifies the time it takes for individuals to achieve successful recourse. 

- Initial qualifications - The initial circumstances of individuals that inform both their starting qualifications and effort they can exert. 

- Circumstance-normalized selection (CNS) - A proposed selection intervention that assigns outcomes proportionally across groups to mitigate unfairness.

- Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) - An existing strategy to improve recourse robustness using augmented counterfactual data.

The key focus areas seem to be defining and evaluating fairness in algorithmic recourse over time, especially through the lens of equality of opportunity and effort individuals exert. The proposed ETR and TTR metrics, along with interventions like CNS, aim to address this.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes two new metrics for evaluating fairness in algorithmic recourse: effort-to-recourse (ETR) and time-to-recourse (TTR). Can you explain in detail how these metrics are formulated, including the key equations? What aspects of fairness do ETR and TTR aim to capture?

2. The paper grounds the proposed metrics in a substantive, luck-egalitarian conception of equality of opportunity. Can you summarize this philosophical doctrine and explain how it relates to evaluating fairness in the context of algorithmic recourse over time? 

3. The paper introduces a flexible agent-based simulation framework for modeling multi-agent recourse over time. What are the key components and dynamics of this simulation model? How is it used to surface unfairness in the form of disparities in ETR and TTR?

4. The paper proposes a fairness intervention called Circumstance-Normalized Selection (CNS) aimed at improving the fairness of recourse. Can you explain the intuition behind CNS and how it relates to the normative grounding from a substantive equality of opportunity perspective? 

5. The paper compares the performance of CNS to an existing benchmark strategy called Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA). What does CDA do and why might combining it with CNS lead to better overall performance in mitigating unfairness?

6. What role does the interplay between initial qualifications and effort play in leading to disparities in ETR and TTR over time, as analyzed extensively in the experiments? How do differences in qualifications and effort compound unfairness?  

7. The experiments analyze ETR and TTR disparities under different parameter settings relating to qualifications, effort, and over time. Can you summarize some of the key trends observed? When are disparities highest and why?

8. The paper discusses the idea that increased effort alone may not be enough for the disadvantaged group to overcome disparities in initial qualifications. What evidence from the experiments supports this finding? Why does this occur?

9. How effective is CNS at mitigating unfairness in ETR and TTR compared to the baseline and CDA? Does its effectiveness depend on the experimental setting? Are there any cases where it does not perform as well?

10. The paper argues that accounting for time-related effects is critical when reasoning about fairness in algorithmic recourse. Why is this the case? What are some of the time-related phenomena that can exacerbate unfairness over time?
