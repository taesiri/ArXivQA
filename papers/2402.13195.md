# [Design and Flight Demonstration of a Quadrotor for Urban Mapping and   Target Tracking Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13195)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of designing a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for urban environment mapping, hazard avoidance, and target tracking research. Urban environments contain clutter and hazards that make autonomous navigation difficult, requiring sensors, algorithms, and platforms tailored for these complex operating conditions.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors present the custom design and experimental validation of a quadrotor platform called the "UNC Charlotte QAV500 drone". The vehicle has a unique sensor payload including stereo fisheye camera pairs for omnidirectional mapping/avoidance and a gimbaled camera for tracking. The sensors are connected to an onboard Nvidia Jetson computer running Robot Operating System (ROS). 

Key Contributions:

1) Hardware Design: The paper details the frame, motors, batteries, cameras and other components selected for the quadrotor. 3D printed mounts were created for components. The platform is relatively low-cost at $1120.

2) Software Integration: ROS nodes were implemented to synchronize and record data from cameras and autopilot. An automated behavior coordinates UAV motion and gimbal orientation to visually track a GPS target.  

3) Performance Characterization: Experiments quantified maximum speed (20 m/s), endurance (11 mins), communication range (500m for 900MHz radio), and acoustic noise profiles.

4) Tracking Demonstration: A flight test validated coordinated UAV/gimbal control to visually track a ground vehicle. Concurrently collected fisheye images were used to reconstruct a 3D map of the area using Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO).

In summary, the paper documents the design and nominal performance of a specialized quadrotor platform to enable research in mapping, autonomy and tracking for urban environments. The system integration and experimental results showcase the platform's capabilities.
