# [A Unified HDR Imaging Method with Pixel and Patch Level](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06943)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is to develop an effective method for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging that can generate high-quality HDR images without ghosting artifacts in dynamic scenes. Specifically, the paper aims to address two key challenges:

1) Recovering detailed content in regions with saturation or misalignment/motion between images. 

2) Adaptively fusing information from differently exposed images to generate a high-quality HDR image.

To address these challenges, the central hypothesis is that using a hybrid approach with both patch-level and pixel-level alignment, along with a Transformer-based adaptive fusion method, can produce improved HDR imaging results compared to prior works. 

The key ideas proposed are:

- A content alignment subnetwork using patch aggregation to fill in content at the patch level along with ghost attention for alignment at the pixel level.

- A gating module to integrate the advantages of patch aggregation and ghost attention. 

- A Transformer-based fusion subnetwork to dynamically merge information from different exposure regions.

Through experiments on public datasets, the paper aims to demonstrate that this hybrid approach can achieve state-of-the-art HDR imaging performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. The central hypothesis is that by jointly exploiting patch-level and pixel-level information in a learnable way, the proposed method can overcome limitations of prior HDR imaging techniques.
