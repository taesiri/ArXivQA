# [Discovering Sensorimotor Agency in Cellular Automata using Diversity   Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10236)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Understanding the self-organization of life and agency starting from simple low-level elements interacting via local rules remains an open and challenging scientific question. 
- Prior work in artificial life has shown that stable, spatially-localized patterns ("individuals") can emerge in cellular automata models but their robustness to external perturbations is limited.

Proposed Solution 
- The authors propose using a diversity search algorithm called Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Process (IMGEP) to automatically search for rules and initial conditions in a continuous cellular automata model called Lenia that lead to the emergence of sensorimotor agents - spatially localized patterns that can move around and maintain integrity despite collisions.
- The search process combines curriculum learning, diversity search, and gradient descent optimization to navigate the vast space of possible rules and discover those that produce agent-like phenomena. 
- The automatically discovered agents are tested on their speed, robustness to obstacles, and generalization abilities on a suite of in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests.

Main Contributions
- First demonstration of an automated search process capable of finding cellular automata rules leading to emergent sensorimotor agents with strong robustness.
- Discovered agents display impressive generalization capabilities including robustness to novel perturbations, ability to maintain coherence across changes of scale and initial state, as well as interactive behaviors like reproduction, attraction, and external guidance.
- Proposed framework, metrics and tools facilitate the discovery and analysis of emergent sensorimotor agency, providing models to study the origins of life, cognition and opportunities for applications in AI and synthetic biology.

In summary, the key innovation is an automated search technique that can reliably discover cellular automata rules exhibiting emergent sensorimotor agents with life-like properties, robustness and generalization abilities. The proposed tools and analyses open up new possibilities for modeling and controlling embodied agency in both artificial and biological systems.
