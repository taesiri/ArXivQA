# [Sequential inductive prediction intervals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04950)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the concept of sequential inductive prediction intervals using theory from sequential testing. It introduces a 3-parameter PAC definition of prediction intervals that allows for almost sharp bounds to be achieved with high probability via simulation. Specifically, it leverages recent results on confidence sequences for quantiles to construct prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage probabilities. By introducing a simulation step, the authors are able to sharpen the bounds, especially for smaller sample sizes. This leads to a 3-parameter PAC guarantee for the prediction intervals, with parameters corresponding to the simulation failure rate, overall failure rate, and coverage probability. The prediction intervals are applied in a conformal prediction framework using a nonconformity score. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for regression problems, including with skewed noise distributions. The paper also considers an "essentially IID" bounded case for situations where the residuals are independent but not identically distributed. Overall, it provides a method for constructing reliable prediction intervals in the inductive conformal prediction setting.
