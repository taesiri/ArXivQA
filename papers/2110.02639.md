# [On The Transferability of Deep-Q Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02639)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How transferable are deep Q-networks in deep reinforcement learning? The authors conduct an empirical study to analyze the transfer learning properties of popular deep Q-network algorithms like DQN, Double DQN and DQV on Atari games. They find that fine-tuning pre-trained agents via transfer learning results in negative transfer in most cases, questioning the level of transferability of these algorithms.To further analyze this, the authors design novel control experiments using different versions of a simple 'Catch' game. Even in these controlled settings, they find surprisingly poor transfer learning performance when fine-tuning pre-trained agents. Through these experiments, the paper aims to thoroughly characterize and understand the transfer learning dynamics of deep Q-networks, which has not been well studied before. The central hypothesis appears to be that deep Q-networks have poor transferability in reinforcement learning compared to supervised deep learning. The experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is - How transferable are deep Q-networks in deep reinforcement learning? And the hypothesis is that they have poor transferability compared to supervised deep nets, which the paper tries to validate through empirical studies.
