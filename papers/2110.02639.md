# [On The Transferability of Deep-Q Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02639)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How transferable are deep Q-networks in deep reinforcement learning? The authors conduct an empirical study to analyze the transfer learning properties of popular deep Q-network algorithms like DQN, Double DQN and DQV on Atari games. They find that fine-tuning pre-trained agents via transfer learning results in negative transfer in most cases, questioning the level of transferability of these algorithms.To further analyze this, the authors design novel control experiments using different versions of a simple 'Catch' game. Even in these controlled settings, they find surprisingly poor transfer learning performance when fine-tuning pre-trained agents. Through these experiments, the paper aims to thoroughly characterize and understand the transfer learning dynamics of deep Q-networks, which has not been well studied before. The central hypothesis appears to be that deep Q-networks have poor transferability in reinforcement learning compared to supervised deep learning. The experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is - How transferable are deep Q-networks in deep reinforcement learning? And the hypothesis is that they have poor transferability compared to supervised deep nets, which the paper tries to validate through empirical studies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Presenting a large scale empirical study analyzing the transfer learning properties of popular deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQV-Learning and DDQN) on the Atari environment. The results show that transferring pre-trained networks in DRL can be challenging and often results in negative transfer. 2. Designing a set of novel control experiments using simple "Catch" environments to further characterize the transfer learning dynamics of Deep-Q Networks. These experiments reveal surprising results like networks failing to transfer knowledge even when source and target tasks are nearly identical.3. Gaining new insights into the training dynamics of Deep-Q Networks. The paper hypothesizes these algorithms have two distinct learning phases - training the feature extractor and training the final policy layer. Transfer fails when these components are not properly synchronized. 4. Though Deep-Q Networks have poor transferability, the paper argues this is an algorithm-specific limitation rather than a general one for DRL. They provide examples of how transfer can succeed under different DRL algorithms.In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of transfer learning for Deep-Q Networks, reveals their limitations in this area, and offers insights into why transfer is so challenging for this specific family of DRL algorithms. The novelty seems to be in the large-scale experiments and new understanding of Deep-Q Network training dynamics when approached from a transfer learning perspective.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is how I would compare it to other related work:- This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on the transferability of Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), including variants like DQV and DDQN, across different Atari games and custom control environments. In contrast, most prior work has studied transfer learning for DQNs on a more limited set of tasks. For example, Farebrother et al. (2018) looked at generalization between only 4 games, while Tyo et al. (2020) examined transfer between 3 games. So this paper provides a broader investigation of DQN transferability.- The paper finds mostly negative or no transfer when fine-tuning pretrained DQN models on new tasks. This aligns with and confirms the preliminary observations of Farebrother et al. However, it contradicts Tyo et al.'s claim that fine-tuning leads to positive transfer from simpler to harder tasks. The more extensive experiments in this paper provide stronger evidence regarding the lack of transferability of DQNs under fine-tuning.- Through new control experiments, the paper uncovers that DQNs exhibit poor self-transfer, even when the source and target tasks are the same. This is a novel finding not identified in prior work, and sheds light on the inherent challenges of transferring DQNs. - The paper offers a hypothesis about the two conflicting objectives DQNs have to balance during training - learning robust features versus estimating the value function. The proposed "hybrid" fine-tuning method provides a way to reconcile these objectives and achieve positive transfer in some cases. This analysis of the internals of DQN training dynamics is unique.- In contrast to the negative results here, some prior work has shown transfer learning benefits in DRL for other methods like policy gradients (Parisotto et al., 2015; Rusu et al., 2016) and model-based RL (Landolfi et al., 2019; Sasso et al., 2021). This suggests the lack of transferability may be specific to DQNs, rather than DRL in general.In summary, compared to related work, this paper provides a significantly more comprehensive investigation of DQN transfer learning, uncovers new challenges and dynamics, and strengthens the overall evidence regarding the difficulty of effectively transferring DQNs. The insights could help guide development of more transferable DQN variants.
