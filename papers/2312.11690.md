## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content, it appears this paper provides stability data for a large number of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Specifically, it compiles information on whether 101 MOFs are stable or unstable when exposed to water or other conditions like heat, acid/base solutions, etc. This stability data is summarized in a table that indicates the reference, name of the MOF(s) tested, whether the MOF(s) was found to be stable or unstable in water, and includes the justification/evidence sentence from the reference paper. The main contribution seems to be aggregating and standardizing water stability data across many different MOFs to provide a resource for researching and comparing MOF stability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, which appears to be a dataset of MOF stability information, some key terms and keywords related to this paper include:

- MOF (metal-organic framework) - The compounds being studied
- Stability - A key property being examined, including stability in water, acids, bases, etc.
- Water stability - Specifically stability when exposed to liquid water or water vapor
- Hydrothermal stability - Stability under hot, aqueous conditions
- Chemical stability - Stability when exposed to various chemical environments and solvents
- PXRD (powder X-ray diffraction) - An analytical technique used to assess retention of crystallinity and confirm stability
- Hydrophobicity - Property that contributes to stability against water in some MOFs
- Crystallinity - Key indicator of stability, with retention implying a stable framework

The paper compiles stability data on a wide variety of MOFs when exposed to various conditions, with a focus on their interaction with and robustness to water exposure. Keywords like hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, hydrothermal conditions, acids/bases, and solvents are also relevant based on the stability testing conditions covered.
