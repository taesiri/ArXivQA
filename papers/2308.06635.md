# [3DMOTFormer: Graph Transformer for Online 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an online 3D multi-object tracking framework that relies primarily on geometric cues from detections and reduces the need for heavily engineered components? Specifically, the paper proposes a new approach called 3DMOTFormer that uses a graph transformer architecture to learn associations between tracks and detections frame-by-frame in an online manner. The key ideas and goals of 3DMOTFormer seem to be:- To reduce the reliance on handcrafted components like motion models and association metrics that are commonly used in model-based 3D MOT approaches. The paper aims to develop a more end-to-end learned framework.- To address the problem of distribution mismatch between training and inference that affects many previous learning-based MOT methods. The paper proposes a training strategy that closely mimics the online inference process.- To exploit the capabilities of transformers and graph neural networks for reasoning on the relationships between tracks and detections and learning associations in an online setting.- To achieve state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark compared to other geometry-based MOT methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of their learned association framework.So in summary, the central research question is about developing a learned, online 3D MOT framework that relies primarily on geometric information from detections and aims to reduce reliance on engineered components while achieving strong performance. The 3DMOTFormer approach and training strategy are proposed to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new graph transformer-based framework for online 3D multi-object tracking called 3DMOTFormer. The main contributions are:- It uses an Edge-Augmented Graph Transformer model to reason on the track-detection bipartite graph and estimate data association via edge classification. This reduces the need for handcrafted components compared to previous methods.- It introduces a novel online training strategy with an autoregressive forward pass and sequential batch optimization to reduce the distribution mismatch between training and online inference. - It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset among geometry-based approaches, with 71.2% and 68.2% AMOTA on the validation and test splits using CenterPoint detections.- It shows good generalization ability, where a trained 3DMOTFormer model achieves competitive performance when run on detections from different detectors than it was trained on.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new graph transformer architecture and training strategy tailored for online 3D MOT that achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing heuristics and generalizing across detectors. The online training is a key novelty to bridge the gap between training and inference.
