# [3DMOTFormer: Graph Transformer for Online 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06635)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an online 3D multi-object tracking framework that relies primarily on geometric cues from detections and reduces the need for heavily engineered components? Specifically, the paper proposes a new approach called 3DMOTFormer that uses a graph transformer architecture to learn associations between tracks and detections frame-by-frame in an online manner. The key ideas and goals of 3DMOTFormer seem to be:- To reduce the reliance on handcrafted components like motion models and association metrics that are commonly used in model-based 3D MOT approaches. The paper aims to develop a more end-to-end learned framework.- To address the problem of distribution mismatch between training and inference that affects many previous learning-based MOT methods. The paper proposes a training strategy that closely mimics the online inference process.- To exploit the capabilities of transformers and graph neural networks for reasoning on the relationships between tracks and detections and learning associations in an online setting.- To achieve state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark compared to other geometry-based MOT methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of their learned association framework.So in summary, the central research question is about developing a learned, online 3D MOT framework that relies primarily on geometric information from detections and aims to reduce reliance on engineered components while achieving strong performance. The 3DMOTFormer approach and training strategy are proposed to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new graph transformer-based framework for online 3D multi-object tracking called 3DMOTFormer. The main contributions are:- It uses an Edge-Augmented Graph Transformer model to reason on the track-detection bipartite graph and estimate data association via edge classification. This reduces the need for handcrafted components compared to previous methods.- It introduces a novel online training strategy with an autoregressive forward pass and sequential batch optimization to reduce the distribution mismatch between training and online inference. - It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset among geometry-based approaches, with 71.2% and 68.2% AMOTA on the validation and test splits using CenterPoint detections.- It shows good generalization ability, where a trained 3DMOTFormer model achieves competitive performance when run on detections from different detectors than it was trained on.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new graph transformer architecture and training strategy tailored for online 3D MOT that achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing heuristics and generalizing across detectors. The online training is a key novelty to bridge the gap between training and inference.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this paper compares to other research in online 3D multi-object tracking (MOT):- It proposes a new learned framework called 3DMOTFormer that is based on transformers, unlike other learning-based 3D MOT methods that typically use graph neural networks. Using a transformer architecture is novel for this task.- The method reasons on a bipartite graph between tracks and detections frame-by-frame. This is different from other graph-based MOT approaches that build a spatiotemporal graph over a fixed time window. The bipartite representation simplifies the online operation.- The training strategy is tailored for online MOT by using an autoregressive forward pass and accumulating losses over frames. This better mimics the online inference and reduces the train-test distribution mismatch compared to typical offline or teacher-forcing training.- It achieves state-of-the-art performance among geometry-based MOT methods on the nuScenes dataset. The 68.2% AMOTA on the test set surpasses other published learning-based and model-based approaches using the same CenterPoint detections.- It shows better generalization across different object detectors compared to other learning-based MOT methods. This allows flexible deployment with different detectors.Overall, the main novelties are the transformer architecture adapted to MOT, the online bipartite graph representation, and the training strategy. The strong empirical results demonstrate this is a promising new direction for learned online 3D MOT. A key advantage is reducing hand-crafted components and expert knowledge compared to model-based MOT approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Investigating other possible graph representations for online MOT besides the bipartite graph used in this work. The authors mention that other graph formulations like spatiotemporal graphs could also be promising.- Exploring different transformer architectures and attention mechanisms tailored for MOT. The authors show the effectiveness of using an edge-augmented graph transformer, but other variants could also be beneficial.- Applying the online training strategy to other tracking paradigms beyond tracking-by-detection, such as tracking-by-regression. The proposed online training approach could potentially benefit other online tracking frameworks.- Incorporating additional cues like appearance information along with the geometry-based approach. The authors suggest appearance could complement the geometry for handling complex scenarios.- Evaluating the approach on other datasets besides nuScenes to analyze generalization across different domains. The authors demonstrate generalization across detectors, but testing on more datasets could be useful.- Investigating end-to-end joint detection and tracking models built upon the tracking framework. The authors propose the tracking framework could serve as a base for exploring joint detection and tracking.- Applying the tracking method to real-time systems and analyzing runtime optimizations for efficiency. The authors note the potential for autonomous driving but further optimization may be needed.In summary, the main future directions are exploring variants of the graph representation and transformer architecture, applying the online training strategy to other paradigms, incorporating multimodal cues, evaluating on more datasets, end-to-end joint modeling, and optimizations for real-time usage.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes 3DMOTFormer, a transformer-based 3D multi-object tracking method for autonomous driving that models object associations as a bipartite graph and performs data association via edge classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes 3DMOTFormer, a novel online 3D multi-object tracking framework based on transformer architecture. The method uses an Edge-Augmented Graph Transformer to reason on the bipartite graph between tracks and detections frame-by-frame to conduct data association via edge classification. To reduce the distribution mismatch between training and inference, the method uses an autoregressive and recurrent forward pass as well as sequential batch optimization during training. Using CenterPoint detections, 3DMOTFormer achieves state-of-the-art AMOTA scores of 71.2% and 68.2% on the nuScenes validation and test splits respectively. A key advantage is that a trained 3DMOTFormer model generalizes well across different object detectors. The transformer architecture allows effective modelling of interactions between tracks and detections in the bipartite graph structure. The online training strategy closely mimics the online inference setting to avoid overfitting. Overall, the method provides accurate online 3D MOT with reduced reliance on handcrafting and heuristics compared to previous approaches.
