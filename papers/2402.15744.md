# [Traditional Transformation Theory Guided Model for Learned Image   Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15744)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing learning-based image compression methods focus on medium/high bitrates and have poor performance at ultra low bitrates.
- Traditional image compression methods introduce artifacts at low bitrates.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an ultra low bitrate enhanced invertible encoding network guided by traditional transformation theory. 
- Leverage invertible neural network (INN) architecture for lossless compression.
- Introduce Block Discrete Cosine Transform (BDCT) layer to model sparsity of features and improve compression rate.
- Use Haar transform layer for reversible, multi-resolution analysis to improve reconstruction while keeping bitrate low.

Main Contributions:
- Fuse traditional transformation theory with deep learning for ultra low bitrate image compression.
- BDCT layer halves required bitrate while maintaining quality.
- Haar layer further improves reconstruction without increasing bitrate.
- Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at low bitrates on Kodak & custom datasets.
- At 0.05 bpp, achieves 25.7 dB PSNR on custom dataset, 24.3 dB on Kodak - much higher than other methods.
- Qualitative results also show proposed method recovers more accurate details compared to others.

In summary, the paper effectively integrates traditional signal processing with deep learning to achieve superior ultra low bitrate image compression, with both quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods. The BDCT and Haar transform contribute to these gains.
