## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach called Dynamic Logic-Geometric Program (D-LGP) for efficient combined task and motion planning (TAMP). D-LGP integrates a Dynamic Tree Search (DTS) method for high-level task planning with a global optimization strategy for low-level motion planning. Specifically, DTS employs backpropagation from the target configuration to quickly explore the combinatorial action space and identify feasible skeletons. The motion planning component formulates trajectories as mixed-integer convex programs, enabling globally optimal solutions. Experiments on manipulation tasks with long horizons demonstrate superior performance over sampling-based and local optimization methods. Key benefits include faster computation times, 100% success rates on challenging benchmarks, and optimal solutions. D-LGP is validated on a real robot that constructs block towers, using replanning to handle uncertainties. The method's efficiency and optimality make it well-suited for practical robotic manipulation tasks requiring tight integration of symbolic planning and continuous trajectories.
