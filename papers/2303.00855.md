# [Grounded Decoding: Guiding Text Generation with Grounded Models for   Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00855)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is how to effectively leverage the knowledge and capabilities of large language models for embodied tasks like robot control. The key ideas explored are:

- Large language models (LLMs) have a lot of semantic knowledge from pretraining on large amounts of text data, but lack grounding in real world environments. 

- Robot policies learned from interaction data are grounded in embodiment and environment, but may lack high-level semantic understanding.

- The proposed approach, Grounded Decoding (GD), combines the strengths of LLMs and grounded policies by decoding sequences that have high probability under both the LLM and "grounding functions" that model embodied probabilities like affordances.

- GD resembles probabilistic filtering, selecting tokens that are likely under the LLM and grounded models. This enables complex, long-horizon robot tasks by leveraging knowledge from both models.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that guiding LLM decoding with probabilities from grounded models can achieve strong performance on embodied tasks by combining their complementary strengths. The experiments across three robot domains seem aimed at validating this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be presenting Grounded Decoding (GD), an approach for guiding natural language generation with large language models (LLMs) in embodied domains like robotics. Specifically:

- GD frames the problem as a type of probabilistic filtering, where the goal is to decode text sequences that have high probability under both the LLM and "grounding" models that represent constraints and objectives in the physical world. 

- By factorizing the joint probability into the LLM's text probability and probabilities from grounding models (like affordances, safety, etc.), GD allows leveraging the knowledge and semantic capabilities of LLMs while grounding their outputs in the physical world.

- GD is demonstrated on three robotics domains: simulated tabletop rearrangement, a 2D maze, and a real mobile manipulator. The results show GD can solve complex, long-horizon tasks by combining the reasoning of the LLM and grounding from models trained on robot interaction data.

- GD provides a general, flexible framework for guiding LLM decoding. Different grounding models like affordances, safety, preferences, or multimodal embeddings can be seamlessly incorporated based on the task.

So in summary, the key contribution seems to be presenting this method for grounding LLMs in embodied domains by decoding sequences that are likely under both the LLM and grounded models, enabling leveraging LLM knowledge while adhering to real-world constraints. The generality and benefits of this approach are demonstrated across three distinct robotics domains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper presents a new method called Grounded Decoding (GD) for guiding language model text generation using grounded models from robotics. Other recent works have explored ways to ground language models in embodied domains, but this is a novel approach combining decoding strategies from NLP with learned robotic models.

- A key innovation is the probabilistic filtering view of jointly decoding based on language model probability and grounded model probability at each token. This is flexible compared to prior works that often require end-to-end fine-tuning or constrain the action space.

- The paper explores a diverse set of grounding models including affordances, safety, preferences, and object detection. This demonstrates the generality of the GD framework across functions and embodied domains. Other methods typically focus on just one type of grounding model like affordances.

- They demonstrate long-horizon, open-vocabulary control on complex tasks in three environments: tabletop rearrangement, 2D maze navigation, and real-world mobile manipulation. The breadth of complex tasks solved highlights the capabilities enabled by GD. Prior embodied LM works tend to use more constrained environments and simpler tasks.

- Compared to prior decoding methods, GD incorporates environment grounding during decoding rather than post-hoc filtering or re-ranking. This allows tighter integration and scales better to large action spaces.

- The work draws connections to related areas like task and motion planning and hierarchical RL, but the probabilistic decoding view and use of large LMs differentiates the approach.

Overall, this paper introduces a general, flexible framework for grounding language model generation that obtains strong results across diverse robotic domains. The variety of grounding models and long-horizon tasks demonstrated are a key distinction from prior embodied LM approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing better grounding functions and integrating them more closely with the language model, rather than using them just to guide decoding. The authors suggest that recent progress in large-scale robotics models could help provide better grounding functions. They also propose investigating fusing grounding information into the language model during decoding, rather than just using it to score tokens after each decoding step.

- Exploring different ways to integrate grounding information and different grounding functions beyond just using them to score tokens. The flexibility of the grounded decoding approach enables experimentation with different grounding models and integration techniques.

- Developing a single foundation model capable of both language understanding and grounding, rather than separating the language model and grounding functions. The authors suggest current grounding functions are a bottleneck compared to language model capabilities.

- Prompt engineering and tuning is needed in many cases to constrain the language model's outputs. The authors suggest ways to reduce this prompting burden could be explored.

- The joint decoding approach may be limiting compared to having a single model do language understanding and grounding together. The authors suggest investigating integrated model architectures.

- Applying grounded decoding to more domains and tasks to further demonstrate its generality and flexibility.

In summary, the key suggestions are improving the grounding models and their integration with language models, reducing the need for prompting engineering, and exploring integrated model architectures that handle language and grounding together. Overall the aim is to improve the synergy between language semantic understanding and real-world grounding.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper presents Grounded Decoding (GD), a method for guiding text generation in embodied domains like robotics by combining the knowledge and capabilities of large language models with grounded models of the environment and robot. GD decodes sequences that have high probability under both the language model, for semantic reasoning, and grounded models, for physical world grounding. It works by selecting tokens at each step that maximize the product of probabilities from the language model and various grounding models, such as affordances, safety, or user preferences. Experiments in three robotics domains (simulated tabletop rearrangement, 2D maze navigation, and real-world mobile manipulation) show that GD can solve complex, long-horizon tasks by leveraging knowledge from both the large pretrained language model and learned grounded models of the environment. The key idea is to guide language model generations to be not just semantically coherent but also executable by the robot in the real physical world.

The paper presents Grounded Decoding (GD), an approach for leveraging large language models (LLMs) in embodied domains such as robotics. GD combines the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs with grounded models that capture environment dynamics and robot capabilities. 

GD works by decoding tokens from the LLM distribution that have high probability under both the LLM and grounded models.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents Grounded Decoding (GD), a method for leveraging large language models (LLMs) for robot control. The key idea is to decode sequences from the LLM that have high probability under both the LLM and grounded models that capture affordances, safety constraints, user preferences etc. Specifically, GD frames the problem as probabilistic filtering, decoding tokens iteratively that have high probability under both the LLM p(w|prefix) and a grounded model p_G(w|state). By combining the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs with grounding constraints that situate the agent, GD is able to solve complex, long-horizon robotic tasks. The method is demonstrated in three distinct environments: simulated tabletop rearrangement, a 2D maze, and a real-world mobile manipulation task. The results show that grounding is critical for solving tasks successfully, and that GD can leverage different types of grounding functions like affordances, safety, preferences, and object detectors. Overall, GD offers a general and scalable approach for grounding the knowledge in LLMs for robotic control.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to leverage the knowledge and capabilities of large language models for embodied agents and robots. 

Specifically, the paper discusses the challenges of applying large language models (LLMs) that are trained on internet-scale textual data to robotics settings. LLMs lack experience with the physical world, cannot parse non-language observations like images, and are not aware of safety constraints or rewards that are important for robot behavior. 

On the other hand, language-conditioned robotic policies that are trained on real-world interaction data have the necessary grounding and embodiment but may lack the high-level semantic understanding and reasoning that large language models can provide.

To combine the strengths of both types of models, the paper introduces "Grounded Decoding" (GD), which is a method to guide the text generation of LLMs using additional "grounding" probabilities from models conditioned on the physical state and embodiment. This allows leveraging the knowledge in LLMs while keeping them properly grounded for robotic tasks.

In summary, the key problem is enabling large language models to be useful for embodied agents by grounding them in the physical world and agent capabilities, combining their strengths with learned robotic policies and models. Grounded Decoding is presented as a general and flexible approach to achieve this.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper presents Grounded Decoding (GD), a method for guiding text generation from large language models (LLMs) in embodied domains such as robotics. The key idea is to decode sequences that have high probability under both the LLM and a set of grounded models capturing aspects like affordances, safety, user preferences, etc. Specifically, GD frames sequence decoding as probabilistic filtering, selecting tokens that maximize the product of probabilities from the LLM and grounded models. This allows GD to leverage the knowledge and semantics of LLMs while grounding them in what's possible/preferred given the physical embodiment and environment state. The method is demonstrated on three robotics domains: 1) simulated tabletop rearrangement, with grounding for affordances, safety, and user preferences; 2) a 2D maze domain with grounding from goal-conditioned value functions; and 3) a real kitchen domain with grounding from an object detector. The results validate that grounding is critical for good performance on complex, long-horizon robotics tasks and that GD provides an effective approach for incorporating grounding into LLM-based decoding. Key strengths include generality across domains, flexibility in composing multiple grounding models, improved sample efficiency compared to alternatives, and decoding directly in the LLM's output space.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents Grounded Decoding (GD), an approach for leveraging the knowledge and capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for robotic control in embodied domains. GD employs "grounding functions" to guide the decoding of LLM token probabilities during sequence generation based on the robot's environment and embodiment. By combining the semantic knowledge and long-horizon reasoning abilities of LLMs with grounding models that represent affordances, safety, user preferences, etc., GD generates command sequences that are feasible for the robot to execute. The method is demonstrated in three domains - simulated tabletop manipulation, 2D navigation mazes, and real-world mobile manipulation - using different grounding functions like object detectors or learned value functions. Experiments show that GD outperforms solitary language models or policies by effectively utilizing both types of models: it leverages the open vocabulary and planning over long time horizons from the LLM along with the grounding in the physical world from the grounding functions.
