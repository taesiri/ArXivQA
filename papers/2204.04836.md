# [Consistency Learning via Decoding Path Augmentation for Transformers in   Human Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04836)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel training strategy called Cross-Path Consistency (CPC) Learning to improve transformer-based architectures for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The key idea is to augment the decoding paths to generate multiple prediction sequences for HOI triplets (e.g. image → HO → I) and enforce consistency between their outputs. Specifically, they introduce decoding path augmentation to produce various subtasks that share the decoder parameters in a multi-task fashion. Then, cross-path consistency regularization is applied to make predictions invariant to different inference paths. This simple yet effective approach boosts performance without increasing model capacity or inference time. Extensive experiments on V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate significant improvements over baseline HOI transformer models. The consistent gains verify that CPC learning improves generalization via knowledge sharing across augmented paths and encouraging learning consistent representations. Ablation studies further prove the efficacy of individual components like shared decoders and the number of augmented paths. In summary, this paper presents a novel training strategy to enhance HOI transformers by leveraging multiple prediction paths and cross-path consistency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a cross-path consistency learning method to improve transformers for human-object interaction detection by augmenting decoding paths and enforcing consistency between predictions from different paths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing Cross-Path Consistency (CPC) learning, which is a novel end-to-end learning strategy to improve transformers for HOI detection by leveraging various inference paths. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing decoding path augmentation to generate various inference paths for HOI detection which are compositions of subtasks with a shared decoder. 

2) Introducing cross-path consistency learning to enforce the outputs from the various augmented decoding paths to be consistent, which improves generalization without increasing model capacity or inference time.

3) Achieving substantial improvements on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks by applying the proposed CPC learning strategy to transformer-based HOI detection models. The improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of CPC in boosting performance of HOI transformers.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CPC learning framework to improve HOI transformers, which includes the key components of decoding path augmentation and cross-path consistency regularization. Experiments show clear performance gains on HOI detection using this strategy.
