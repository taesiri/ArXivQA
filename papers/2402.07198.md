# [More Benefits of Being Distributional: Second-Order Bounds for   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms use squared loss to learn the expected return/value function. However, it is unclear if and why learning the full return distribution instead, as done in distributional RL (DistRL), results in better performance.

- This paper aims to provide a theoretical justification for why DistRL can attain better sample efficiency and tighter instance-dependent bounds compared to standard RL.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1) Proves that DistRL enjoys second-order bounds in both online and offline RL settings with function approximation:

- Online RL: Achieves bounds that scale with the variance of the played policies' returns, rather than worst-case Tilde{O}(âˆšK) rates. This shows benefits even in near-deterministic MDPs.

- Offline RL: Achieves bounds scaling with the variance of the comparator/optimal policy. This is the first second-order bound for offline RL.  

- Second-order bounds are tighter and more general than previously known small-loss bounds for DistRL.

2) For contextual bandits, proposes a new distributionally optimistic algorithm that achieves:

- A second-order regret bound scaling with variance 

- A novel first and second-order gap-dependent bound  

- Empirically outperforms squared-loss optimistic algorithm

3) The analysis relies simply on distribution generalization bounds, without needing variance-weighted regression used by most prior second-order analyses. This suggests DistRL is an attractive alternative for attaining second-order bounds.

4) Demonstrates the algorithm's strong empirical performance on real-world contextual bandit tasks.

In summary, this paper provides both theoretical and empirical evidence that DistRL can attain tighter second-order bounds in RL, thus further reinforcing the benefits of distributional learning. The analysis is surprisingly simple, relying just on generalization properties of maximum likelihood.
