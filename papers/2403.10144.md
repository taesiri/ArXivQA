# [NLP Verification: Towards a General Methodology for Certifying   Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10144)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the field of natural language processing (NLP) verification:

1. It provides a general characterization and methodology for NLP verification pipelines, identifying the key components involved (dataset selection, perturbation generation, embedding, subspace definition, training, and verification). 

2. It formally defines the notions of "geometric subspaces" and "semantic subspaces" for verification, and shows through experiments that semantic subspaces enable higher verifiability and generalizability.

3. It proposes two new evaluation metrics for NLP verification - "generalizability" of verified subspaces, and "falsifiability" of semantic subspaces. It argues these should be reported alongside standard verification metrics.

4. It demonstrates the existence of a generalizability-verifiability tradeoff in NLP verification, and shows this can be mitigated through precise semantic subspace definition, adversarial training, optimal embedding functions, and filtering. 

5. It provides the first known application of SMT-based verification (using Marabou) to NLP models, and shows it outperforms abstract interpretation methods.

6. It implements the parameterized NLP verification pipeline in a tool called ANTONIO, enabling modular experimentation.

In summary, the main contribution is a coherent methodological framework and set of techniques to improve and evaluate NLP verification pipelines in a more principled manner.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- NLP verification pipeline
- Semantic perturbations
- Embedding functions
- Semantic subspaces 
- Generalisability 
- Verifiability
- Verifiability-generalisability trade-off
- Falsifiability 
- Adversarial training

The paper proposes an end-to-end methodology for verifying neural networks in NLP applications, centered around the concept of an "NLP verification pipeline". It highlights the need to consider semantic information when defining subspaces for verification, through the use of semantic perturbations. Key metrics like generalisability and falsifiability are proposed to complement verifiability when evaluating NLP verification approaches. The trade-offs between verifiability and generalisability are analyzed. Techniques like adversarial training on semantic subspaces are shown to enhance verifiability. The limitations of LLMs are discussed and the concept of small verified "filter" models is suggested to safeguard larger NLP systems. The overarching goal is to enable reliable and verifiable NLP, especially for safety-critical applications.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed NLP verification pipeline capture the verifiability-generalizability trade-off, especially with regards to semantic subspaces? What metrics are used to measure this?

2. The paper argues that the choice of embedding function influences accuracy and performance of the NLP verification pipeline. What evidence is provided regarding this influence and how could future work further analyze this effect systematically? 

3. What novel metrics are introduced in this paper regarding evaluation of semantic subspaces? How are these metrics, such as falsifiability, calculated and what do they indicate about the quality of verified subspaces?

4. What is the difference between geometric and semantic subspaces as defined in this paper? How are they constructed and what evidence supports that semantic subspaces enhance verifiability?

5. This paper adapts PGD adversarial training to operate on semantic rather than geometric subspaces. How is this implemented and what effect does it have compared to standard PGD training?  

6. What heuristics or modifications are proposed regarding construction of semantic subspaces to balance the verifiability-generalizability tradeoff? How effective are they based on the results?

7. What NLP evaluation metrics are co-opted in this paper to analyze validity of sentence perturbations? How are metrics like cosine similarity and ROUGE-N utilized?  

8. How does the paper attempt to measure or estimate semantic validity of perturbations and embedding functions? What are some limitations identified in this analysis?

9. The paper argues that falsifiability of semantic subspaces should be an evaluated and reported metric. On what basis is this argued and what falsifiability rates are found in the experiments?

10. How might the proposed verified classification filters aid development of safer NLP systems according to the paper? What architecture is suggested regarding integration of these filters with large language models?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are being increasingly used in natural language processing (NLP) applications, but they lack formal guarantees on their behavior, especially for safety-critical scenarios. 
- Existing DNN verification techniques from computer vision cannot be directly applied to NLP due to the discrete nature of text data. Specific challenges include the "embedding gap" which refers to discrepancies introduced when mapping text to continuous vector spaces.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper distills an "NLP verification pipeline" with 6 key stages - data selection, perturbation generation, embedding, subspace definition, robust training, and verification. 
- It formally defines geometric and "semantic" subspaces in the embedding space based on sentence perturbations. Semantic subspaces help bridge the verification-generalization tradeoff.
- A new metric called "generalizability" is proposed to measure how many new semantically similar sentences are covered by the verified subspaces. Another metric called "falsifiability" is introduced to quantify erroneous mappings of sentences into verified subspaces.
- A method called "semantically robust training" is introduced which trains DNNs using semantic subspaces to make them more amenable to verification.

Main Contributions:
- Identified and formally defined an "NLP verification pipeline" to systematize work in this area
- Proposed new metrics like generalizability and falsifiability that should be reported alongside verifiability
- Showed semantic subspaces and semantically robust training can help overcome key challenges like the verification-generalization tradeoff
- Demonstrated how techniques like cosine similarity and ROUGE can be used to analyze embedding gaps
- Highlighted the need for greater transparency when reporting NLP verification results to account for effects introduced in the pipeline

The paper makes a case for a more rigorous methodology when approaching NLP verification and provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support the proposals.
