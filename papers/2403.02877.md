# [ActiveAD: Planning-Oriented Active Learning for End-to-End Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
End-to-end differentiable learning for autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has become popular recently. However, these methods have a voracious appetite for high-quality labeled data like 3D bounding boxes and semantic segmentation, which are expensive to manually annotate. This data annotation bottleneck limits the scaling up of E2E-AD methods. Furthermore, behaviors in autonomous driving data have a long-tailed distribution - most data is trivial (simply driving forward) while only a few cases are safety-critical. This makes much of the collected data less useful.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors explore how to achieve sample and label efficiency for E2E-AD. They design an active learning method called ActiveAD which progressively annotates part of the collected raw data based on proposed diversity and usefulness criteria for planning routes. 

ActiveAD introduces Ego-Diversity for initial sample selection, which utilizes nearly free information like weather, lighting and vehicle speed. For subsequent iterative annotation, three metrics are used:
1) Displacement Error between predicted and ground truth trajectories
2) Soft Collision based on distance between predicted ego and agent trajectories 
3) Agent Uncertainty measured by prediction entropy for nearby agents

These metrics directly target planning optimization.

Contributions:
- First work to address data problems of E2E-AD and provide a simple yet effective data selection solution for planning
- Novel task-specific diversity and uncertainty metrics tailored for planning routes
- Extensive experiments show ActiveAD significantly outperforms general active learning methods
- With only 30% nuScenes data, ActiveAD achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art E2E-AD methods trained on full data
- Explores E2E-AD from a data-centric view and inspires future data-driven discoveries

In summary, this paper provides an effective active learning framework to identify valuable autonomous driving data for annotation under limited budget, while optimizing the planning performance. The proposed methodology and empirical analyses offer valuable insights that can guide future research.
