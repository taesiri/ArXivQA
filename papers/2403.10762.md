# [NARRATE: Versatile Language Architecture for Optimal Control in Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Translating high-level natural language instructions into precise low-level actions for robots is an important challenge. While today's robots can follow precise, low-level commands well, most systems require extensive pre-programming for each specific task which limits flexibility. Natural language offers flexibility but grounding language outputs into actions remains difficult. Prior methods using end-to-end learning require much data. Methods asking LLMs to directly output code or actions can be unsafe. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes NARRATE, a modular architecture interfacing language models with model predictive control. It uses an LLM to convert language instructions into mathematical objective functions and constraints. These are input to an MPC controller which plans optimal, safe robot trajectories respecting the constraints. This approach leverages LLMs' flexibility without needing robot-specific training data. It allows incorporating hard constraints for accuracy and safety. The modularity also enables human collaboration and feedback.

Main Contributions:
1) Method to formulate general MPC policies from language for complex robot tasks. LLMs predict free-form mathematical expressions used directly in MPC.
2) Extensive simulation and hardware evaluation across multiple robots showing accuracy, safety and efficiency.
3) Demonstration of natural human-LLM interaction enabled through architecture. Collaboration further improves performance.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable approach leveraging both the power of large language models and optimal control methods to accurately and safely control robots from natural language instructions while allowing flexibility and human collaboration. Evaluations highlight strengths across diverse tasks over existing methods.
