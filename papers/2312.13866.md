# [Understanding Inter-Session Intentions via Complex Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13866)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding user intentions is critical for product search and recommendations. User intentions can be complex, involving requirements for specific brands, colors, materials etc across multiple search sessions.  
- Existing methods do not sufficiently capture such complex logical intentions involving conjunctions (AND), disjunctions (OR) and negations (NOT) across sessions.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the problem as logical session complex query answering (LS-CQA) over a graph with sessions as hyperedges connecting items. 
- Propose a model called Logical Session Graph Transformer (LSGT) to encode the complex logical query structure. It transforms the query graph into tokens for items, sessions, operators, positional embeddings etc which are then fed into a standard Transformer encoder.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce LS-CQA task to capture complex user intentions spanning multiple sessions as logical queries on session-item graphs.
- Propose LSGT that leverages Transformer architecture to effectively encode queries. Proof provided for its expressiveness and permutation invariance properties.
- Experiments conducted on 3 datasets demonstrate LSGT outperforms previous session encoders combined with logical query encoders, especially on queries with negations.
- Analysis shows the importance of modeling both session structure as well as logical relationships between sessions for understanding complex user intentions.

In summary, the paper presents a novel formulation and model to capture complex user logical intentions across sessions for better product search and recommendations. The LSGT model shows strong empirical performance owing to its ability to jointly encode logical and session structures.
