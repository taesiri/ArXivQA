# [Optimizing Two-Pass Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning: Phoneme Recognition   and Phoneme to Grapheme Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03312)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes methods to optimize two-pass cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource speech recognition. A two-pass system first performs phoneme recognition, then phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) translation. To enhance phoneme recognition, Pivot Phoneme Merging (PPM) merges acoustically similar phonemes between languages to maximize shared vocabulary. PPM with 55 pivot phonemes and an edit distance threshold of 0.5 achieves full coverage of phonemes while retaining differentiability. To reduce P2G error propagation, a Global Phoneme Noise (GPN) generator creates realistic recognition noise from clean text to train robust P2G models. Experiments on 10 languages in CommonVoice show PPM+P2G reduces word error rates by 19% versus grapheme baselines by optimizing cross-lingual phoneme sharing. GPN training further boosts P2G performance. The integrated PPM and GPN methods significantly advance two-pass systems for low-resource speech recognition by enhancing phoneme recognition and P2G translation.
