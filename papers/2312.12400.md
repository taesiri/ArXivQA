# [New classes of the greedy-applicable arm feature distributions in the   sparse linear bandit problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12400)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- In sparse linear bandits, existing algorithms require knowing the sparsity level of the unknown parameter vector a priori to ensure optimal regret. However, recent "sparsity agnostic" algorithms based on greedy policies still require strong assumptions like "relaxed symmetry" on the distribution of arm features, which rules out many practical cases. 

Main Contributions:
- Shows that if part of the arm feature distribution belongs to a "greedy-applicable" class that guarantees diversity under greedy sampling, the full mixture model also satisfies such theoretical guarantees. This greatly expands the applicable arm feature distributions.

- Identifies new "greedy-applicable" distribution classes beyond existing assumptions, including Gaussian mixtures, discrete distributions, and radial distributions. This covers many practical asymmetric cases.

- For mixtures, a higher proportion of the "good" greedy-applicable component yields a tighter regret bound. This motivates finding more such distributions.

- Applies the analyses to extend theoretical guarantees for several other algorithms like sparse thresholded LASSO bandits and combinatorial bandits. Also shows application to dense contextual bandits.

- Overall, establishes regret bounds for greedy sampling based sparse bandit algorithms over a much wider range of practical arm feature distributions, without needing to know sparsity levels a priori. Opens up avenues for more work on identifying "greedy-applicable" distributions.
