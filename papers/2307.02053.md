# [Flacuna: Unleashing the Problem Solving Power of Vicuna using FLAN   Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02053)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:Can fine-tuning Vicuna, a large language model based on LLaMA that has been pretrained on ChatGPT conversations, on a customized instruction dataset improve its performance on reasoning-intensive tasks compared to the original Vicuna model?The key hypothesis appears to be:Fine-tuning Vicuna on a subset of the large-scale Flan instruction dataset, combined with conversational and coding datasets, will enhance its problem-solving abilities and lead to significant improvements on benchmark reasoning tasks compared to the original Vicuna model. The researchers aim to investigate the impact of the instruction dataset on model performance by leveraging Vicuna and fine-tuning it on a custom dataset called Flan-mini. The goal is to improve Vicuna's capabilities on tasks requiring strong general reasoning skills.
