# [Flacuna: Unleashing the Problem Solving Power of Vicuna using FLAN   Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02053)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:Can fine-tuning Vicuna, a large language model based on LLaMA that has been pretrained on ChatGPT conversations, on a customized instruction dataset improve its performance on reasoning-intensive tasks compared to the original Vicuna model?The key hypothesis appears to be:Fine-tuning Vicuna on a subset of the large-scale Flan instruction dataset, combined with conversational and coding datasets, will enhance its problem-solving abilities and lead to significant improvements on benchmark reasoning tasks compared to the original Vicuna model. The researchers aim to investigate the impact of the instruction dataset on model performance by leveraging Vicuna and fine-tuning it on a custom dataset called Flan-mini. The goal is to improve Vicuna's capabilities on tasks requiring strong general reasoning skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing Flacuna, a model that improves the problem-solving capabilities of Vicuna through fine-tuning on the Flan-mini instruction dataset. 2. Presenting Flan-mini, a new instruction tuning dataset that combines a subset of the Flan dataset with conversational datasets like those from ChatGPT and GPT-4.3. Demonstrating that fine-tuning Vicuna, an LLaMA-based model, on Flan-mini leads to significant improvements on problem-solving benchmarks like MMLU, BBH, DROP, CRASS, and HumanEval. 4. Showing that fine-tuning on high-quality instruction datasets like Flan can enhance the performance of models like Vicuna on tasks requiring reasoning, creativity, and real-world knowledge.5. Analyzing the limitations of using a small subset of Flan and suggesting potential solutions like using the full Flan dataset or longer input lengths in future work.In summary, the key contribution is introducing Flacuna, a model that achieves substantially better problem-solving abilities compared to Vicuna by leveraging instruction tuning on a carefully curated dataset called Flan-mini. The results highlight the efficacy of instruction tuning in boosting reasoning skills.
