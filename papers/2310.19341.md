# [Skywork: A More Open Bilingual Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19341)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents Skywork-13B, a large multilingual foundation model trained on over 3 trillion tokens of English and Chinese text using a segmented corpus and two-stage training approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks while promoting openness and transparency in language model development.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents Skywork-13B, a bilingual large language model with 13 billion parameters trained on over 3.2 trillion tokens of English and Chinese text data. The authors introduce a two-stage training methodology involving general pre-training followed by domain-specific enhancement training. They construct a massive high-quality training corpus called SkyPile, primarily sourced from public webpages, and release a 150 billion token subset as an open corpus resource. The Skywork-13B model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CEVAL, MMLU and GSM8K. The authors propose using language modeling perplexity on diverse domains as an alternative to static benchmarks for evaluating large language models. They also develop a novel method to detect in-domain training and highlight the need for transparency regarding training data usage. Overall, this paper aims to spur future research by releasing the Skywork-13B model, training checkpoints and corpus data, exemplifying an open and collaborative approach to large language model development.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents Skywork-13B, a large language model with 13 billion parameters that is trained on a corpus of over 3.2 trillion tokens in both English and Chinese. The authors adopt a two-stage training approach, with general purpose pre-training followed by domain-specific enhancement training. During training, they monitor progress not just by training loss but also by validation loss on diverse held-out sets, finding the two to be highly correlated. Skywork-13B demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like CEVAL, MMLU, and GSM8K. A key contribution is the release of both the model and a portion of the 150B+ token training corpus to facilitate research. The authors also propose a novel method to detect in-domain data usage during training, showing many models likely utilize in-domain data. Overall, this work represents an important advance as a high-quality, transparently trained bilingual foundation model, while also calling for renewed openness and fairness principles in the field.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces Skywork-13B, an openly published 13 billion parameter English-Chinese bilingual foundation model trained on over 3 trillion tokens, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chinese language modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop a large language model (LLM) that is more open and transparent, providing comprehensive details on the training data, process, and performance to facilitate reproducibility and further research?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By disclosing the full details of the model architecture, training data, training methodology, and evaluation results, and by releasing the model checkpoints publicly, it is possible to create an LLM that excels on benchmarks while also upholding principles of openness and transparency.

The authors seem motivated by the trend towards commercialization and lack of transparency in recent LLMs, which they argue is detrimental to the open-source community. Their goal is to create an openly published model that "spurs future research" and serves as a "valuable open-source resource to democratize access to high-quality LLMs." 

In summary, the central research question is how to develop an LLM that pushes state-of-the-art performance while also furthering openness, transparency and democratization of access - countering recent trends towards commercialization and opacity. The hypothesis is that comprehensive disclosure of details alongside public release can achieve both aims.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:

1. Releasing Skywork-13B, a large language model with 13 billion parameters trained on over 3.2 trillion tokens of English and Chinese text. This is claimed to be the most extensively trained and openly published LLM of comparable size. 

2. Introducing a two-stage training methodology that involves general pre-training followed by domain-specific enhancement training. This allows targeting both general capabilities and specialized skills.

3. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on Chinese language modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The model appears to particularly excel in Chinese compared to other existing models.

4. Proposing a novel leakage detection method to detect potential data contamination during training. This aims to address concerns around transparency and fairness in LLMs.

5. Releasing part of the massive SkyPile corpus used for pre-training, which contains over 150 billion tokens of Chinese web text. This is claimed to be the largest open Chinese pre-training corpus.

6. Releasing intermediate checkpoints from different stages of training to enable further research.

7. Advocating for greater transparency, fairness and collaboration in the LLM community through their comprehensive open-source approach.

In summary, the main contributions appear to be releasing a new powerful open LLM along with associated resources, while promoting transparency and fairness in the field. The two-stage training approach and leakage detection method also seem notable.
