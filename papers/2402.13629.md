# [Adversarial Purification and Fine-tuning for Robust UDC Image   Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13629)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the robustness issues of deep learning based Under-Display Camera (UDC) image restoration models against adversarial attacks. UDC technology poses unique image degradation challenges like flare, blurring and color distortion which are addressed using deep learning models. However, the susceptibility of these models to adversarial perturbations that can exacerbate the degradation has not been thoroughly studied. Evaluating and enhancing robustness is important for the functionality and reliability of UDC-enabled devices.

Solution:
The paper first evaluates UDC image restoration methods like DISCNet, UDCUNet etc. using white-box (PGD, CW) and black-box (SimBA, Square) attacks. This reveals vulnerabilities, with performance degrading significantly under the CW attack. 

To address this, a defense strategy is proposed combining:
(1) Adversarial purification using diffusion models like DDPM to remove perturbations from input images.  
(2) Fine-tuning the restoration models on purified images without needing adversarial training data to improve robustness and adaptation.

Contributions:
(1) Comprehensive evaluation of UDC image restoration models against adversarial attacks revealing vulnerabilities.
(2) A novel defense framework integrating state-of-the-art purification and fine-tuning techniques to enhance robustness.
(3) Extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of the defense method in guarding against typical adversarial attacks while maintaining or improving restoration performance.

Overall, the key highlight is the proposal and demonstration of a practical and efficient defense strategy to make UDC image restoration models more robust and reliable against evolving adversarial threats. The findings provide useful insights into securing deep learning aided UDC technologies.
