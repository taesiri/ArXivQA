# [How Secure Are Large Language Models (LLMs) for Navigation in Urban   Environments?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robot navigation systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance recently, but their security vulnerabilities have received little attention, especially in complex real-world environments like urban outdoor settings.
- LLMs are known to be sensitive to small perturbations in inputs which can lead to unexpected and incorrect outcomes. This makes LLM-based navigation systems susceptible to adversarial attacks that could compromise their reliability.  

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces a novel "Navigational Prompt Suffix (NPS)" attack tailored to LLM-based navigation models. 
- The NPS attack involves appending gradient-derived adversarial suffixes to the original navigational prompt. This causes the LLM-based navigation model to predict incorrect actions.

Experiments:
- Comprehensive experiments were conducted on multiple variants of the VELMA model which uses different LLMs for reasoning. Experiments were done in both few-shot learning and fine-tuning settings.
- Two real-world street view datasets - Touchdown and Map2Seq were used for evaluation.
- Results showed significant declines in performance across three metrics when white-box and black-box NPS attacks were launched. This demonstrates the generalizability and transferability of the attacks.

Key Contributions:
- Pioneers the exploration of vulnerabilities in LLM-based navigation models for outdoor urban settings - an important area given potential risks.
- Introduces a novel NPS attack tailored to LLM models that causes them to predict incorrect actions by manipulating the navigational prompt.
- Experiments demonstrate effectiveness of NPS attacks on multiple LLM-based navigation systems, highlighting need for enhanced security.
- Proposes preliminary "Navigational Prompt Engineering (NPE)" defense strategy to reduce impact of attacks by focusing model's attention on key navigational keywords.

The paper underscores the need for more research into adversarial threats faced by LLM-based navigation systems to ensure their safe and reliable deployment in the real world.
