# [PATCH -- Psychometrics-AssisTed benCHmarking of Large Language Models: A   Case Study of Mathematics Proficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) have limitations: questionable measurement quality, lack of assessment on the item level, and unclear human reference population for comparison.

Proposed Solution - PATCH Framework:
- Introduce a new framework called PATCH (**P**sychometrics-**A**ssis**T**ed ben**CH**marking) that leverages knowledge from psychometrics to address the limitations. 

- Core of PATCH is using a psychometrically validated test that measures the intended construct (e.g. 8th grade math proficiency) and has been tested on a representative human sample.

- Allows more accurate estimation of proficiency than current LLMs benchmarks, provides item diagnostics, and enables valid human-model comparisons.

Demonstration and Contributions:
- Demonstrate PATCH by testing GPT-4 and Gemini on a grade 8 math test from the TIMSS 2011 assessment.

- Show evaluation outcomes differ from conventional benchmarking practices. Highlights potential of psychometrics to improve LLM benchmarking.  

- Release benchmark dataset based on TIMSS 2011 and 3 other math and science datasets to support future research.

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of current LLM benchmarks and proposes integrating psychometrics via the PATCH framework to address them. A demonstration on grade 8 math evaluates well-known LLMs and shows the difference from typical benchmarking. Datasets are released to facilitate future psychometrics-based benchmarking research.
