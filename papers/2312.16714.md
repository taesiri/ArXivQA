# [A Reversible Perspective on Petri Nets and Event Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16714)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Event structures are an important model for concurrency that captures causality and conflicts between events. Recently, they have been extended to reversible event structures to model reversible concurrent systems where computations can be undone. However, there is no systematic procedure to associate an operational model like Petri nets to reversible event structures, especially to capture their full generality going beyond just causal consistency. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces reversible causal nets, which are a subclass of Petri nets extended with inhibitor arcs. These provide an operational model that corresponds precisely to reversible prime event structures.

- Causal nets are proposed first to capture non-reversible prime event structures. They use inhibitor arcs to model causality between transitions, departing from typical Petri nets that use the flow relation for causality. They are shown to correspond to prime event structures.

- Reversible causal nets extend causal nets by introducing backward/reversing transitions corresponding to each forward/reversible transition. Inhibitor arcs are used to model reverse causality and prevention relations in reversible event structures. Additional constraints ensure backpack transitions correctly undo effects of forward transitions.

- It is shown through multiple theoretical results that reversible causal nets precisely capture configurations of reversible prime event structures, providing an accurate operational model.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of causal nets that use inhibitor arcs for causality and their connection to prime event structures.

- Definition of reversible causal nets that extend causal nets with backward transitions and additional inhibitor arcs to model reversibility relations.

- Theoretical results establishing reversible causal nets as an adequate operational model for reversible prime event structures, able to handle features like out-of-causal order reversibility.

- Discussion relating causal nets to occurrence nets and limitations of extending occurrence nets for unrestrained reversibility models.

- Illustration of modeling concurrent reversible systems like sagas and reversible debugging using reversible causal nets.

The key significance is providing the first Petri net model that fully corresponds to reversible prime event structures, advancing prior limited approaches. This bridges the operational and denotational realms for reversibility.
