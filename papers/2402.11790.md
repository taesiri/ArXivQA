# [CoLRIO: LiDAR-Ranging-Inertial Centralized State Estimation for Robotic   Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11790)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurate state estimation of robotic swarms operating in GPS-denied environments is a key challenge. Existing approaches rely on external infrastructure like motion capture systems, UWB anchors, or GPS, limiting their versatility. Other methods require significant view overlap between robots to establish constraints, restricting the swarm's flexibility. This paper aims to develop a centralized collaborative state estimation system for robotic swarms equipped with LiDAR, IMU and UWB sensors, without needing anchor deployment.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes CoLRIO, a centralized LiDAR-Ranging-Inertial Odometry system. It has two key components:

1. Front-end on each robot: Runs a tightly coupled LiDAR-inertial odometry using intensity-aided scan matching and fixed-lag smoothing. It generates keyframes with odometry and UWB measurements to send to the server.

2. Back-end on central server: Detects inter-robot loop closures, validates UWB measurements against odometry to reject outliers, and performs robust joint optimization over factors from all robots to refine trajectories. These are sent back to robots.

Main Contributions:

- An efficient LiDAR inertial front-end using intensity-aided scan matching and fixed-lag smoothing for accuracy.

- A centralized system enabling collaborative state estimation of robotic swarms without anchor deployment, using UWB and loop closures.

- Robust back-end optimization on server leveraging outlier rejection, place recognition and global optimization. 

- Extensive comparative evaluation showing improved accuracy over state-of-the-art odometry and collaborative SLAM methods.

- Demonstrated scalability to 10 robots with competitive accuracy and bandwidth requirements, highlighting applicability to large swarm missions.

The system is made open-source to contribute to the research community. Future work includes enhancing scalability and handling significant outlier measurements.
