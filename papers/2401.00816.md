# [GLIMPSE: Generalized Local Imaging with MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00816)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Standard CNNs like U-Net for CT image reconstruction from filtered backprojections (FBPs) require large receptive fields to leverage information distributed across the FBP image. This causes overfitting and poor generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
- Model-based networks like learned primal-dual (LPD) improve OOD performance but have prohibitive memory and computational complexity, making training intractable beyond resolutions like 512x512.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a local processing network called Glimpse that uses a simple MLP to reconstruct each pixel from only its associated measurements in the sinogram. 
- This localization enables strong OOD performance with a fixed memory footprint independent of image resolution, allowing training on 1024x1024 images.
- Glimpse is designed to be fully differentiable, enabling estimation of projection angles in uncalibrated systems and learning noise-adaptive filters during training.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of Glimpse, a fast and memory-efficient local processing network for CT image reconstruction using a simple MLP on sinogram patches.
- Strong performance on OOD data while using 5GB memory to train on 1024x1024 images, unlike CNNs that require >100GB. 
- Estimation of projection angles in uncalibrated systems through end-to-end training.
- Learning adaptive filters matched to noise levels in measurements through differentiable architecture.
- Comparable or better performance than U-Net and LGS on in-distribution data and significantly better OOD generalization than U-Net.

In summary, the paper proposes a fast, memory-efficient, and generalizable approach for CT image reconstruction that can also address real-world challenges like sensor calibration and noise adaptation through its differentiable design.
