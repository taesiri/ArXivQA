# [You Only Need One Color Space: An Efficient Network for Low-light Image   Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05809)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods using deep learning rely on sRGB or HSV color spaces. However, these color spaces are not suitable for handling the low signal-to-noise ratio in low-light images.
- Applying enhancement in these color spaces leads to color artifacts and brightness distortions in the enhanced images. Complex network architectures and additional losses are needed to reduce these artifacts.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI) color space with trainable parameters that decouples image brightness and color.
- HVI adapts to different illumination ranges in low-light images and avoids limitations of sRGB and HSV color spaces.
- Propose Color and Intensity Decoupling Network (CIDNet) with two branches - HV-way processes color information and Intensity-way handles brightness. 
- A Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA) module connects the two branches to facilitate interaction between image structure and content from each branch.
- Symmetric HVI transform modules are used before and after CIDNet to convert between sRGB and HVI color spaces.

Main Contributions:
- Novel HVI color space that decouples brightness and color of images while adapting to low-light conditions.
- CIDNet leverages HVI space with two-branch architecture and LCA module for effective low-light image enhancement.
- State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance across 11 datasets while using fewer parameters and computations than prior arts.
- Extensive ablation studies validate the design choices around HVI space, two-branch network, LCA module and loss formulations.

In summary, the paper presents a specialized HVI color space and CIDNet tailored for low-light image enhancement that outperforms previous approaches. The modular design also enables easier diagnosis and interpretation.
