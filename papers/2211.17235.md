# [NeRFInvertor: High Fidelity NeRF-GAN Inversion for Single-shot Real   Image Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17235)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we achieve high-fidelity, 3D-consistent, and identity-preserving animation of real subjects given only a single image, by inverting existing NeRF-GAN models?

The key points are:

- NeRF-GAN models can generate high quality fake identity images by sampling latent codes, but struggle with animating real images due to inversion difficulties. 

- Directly optimizing latent codes for real images leads to a trade-off between identity preservation vs 3D consistency.

- The paper proposes a method called NeRFInvertor to surgically fine-tune NeRF-GANs to enable high fidelity inversion and animation from a single real image.

- NeRFInvertor uses image space losses to reduce identity gap, along with novel explicit and implicit 3D regularizations to maintain geometry. 

- Experiments validate NeRFInvertor can enable realistic, 3D consistent animation of real faces on multiple NeRF-GAN models.

In summary, the central research question is how to achieve high quality inversion and animation of real images with NeRF-GANs given only a single input image, which NeRFInvertor aims to address.
