# [Is Context Helpful for Chat Translation Evaluation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08314)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the quality of machine translations for conversational chat data is important but challenging. Unlike structured news text, chats are unstructured, short, context-heavy.  
- Existing automatic MT evaluation metrics are designed and tested primarily on news data. Their reliability for assessing chat translations is unclear.

Analysis:
- Compared chat and news translations to analyze differences in error frequency and types. Found 21% fewer errors in chats but different dominant error types across domains.

- Benchmarked sentence-level metrics on chat data. Reference-based Comet performs best overall. Big gap between reference-free and reference-based metrics, especially for non-English translations.

Proposed Solution: 
- Extend neural learned metrics (Comet, xComet) to incorporate conversational context to inform quality estimation. Test impact of context from same and both speakers.

- Propose Context-MQM: prompt GPT-4 with bilingual context to identify errors in translations instead of overall quality score.

Key Findings:
- Adding context helps quality estimation, especially for reference-free metrics and out-of-English translations. Complete bilingual context works best.  

- Context most useful for short, ambiguous sentences and doesn't help reference-based Comet. Noisy or incomplete context hurts performance.

- Preliminary Context-MQM results show bilingual context helps GPT-4 better identify errors, outperforming context-agnostic prompting.

Main Contributions:
- First meta-evaluation of sentence-level automatic metrics on chat translation quality estimation
- Analysis of impact of conversational context on helping estimate chat translation quality
- Proposed contextual extensions to integrate context into existing learned metrics and LLMs for quality estimation
