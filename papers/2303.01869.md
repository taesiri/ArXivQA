# [Intrinsic Physical Concepts Discovery with Object-Centric Predictive   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01869)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can machines learn to discover and represent abstract physical concepts such as mass and charge in an unsupervised manner, by observing objects and how they interact in videos?

The key hypotheses are:

1) Commonsense knowledge about physics emerges when training systems to make predictions at the object level.

2) Physical concepts at different levels of abstraction (from visual attributes to hidden properties like mass) should be learned in a bottom-up fashion through increasingly long-term prediction.

The paper proposes a model called PHYCINE that aims to learn disentangled representations of objects containing physical concepts at different levels of abstraction. The model is trained on raw videos in an unsupervised way to infer concepts like mass and charge by modeling object interactions and predicting future states. The effectiveness of the learned representations is evaluated on causal reasoning tasks.

In summary, the main research question is how to learn representations of abstract physical concepts in an unsupervised manner from videos, with the key hypotheses relating to using object-centric predictive modeling and bottom-up training.
