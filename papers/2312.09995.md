# [SAT-Based Algorithms for Regular Graph Pattern Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09995)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph matching is an important problem with applications in pattern recognition, software analysis, computational biology, etc. 
- Existing approaches like graph isomorphism, approximate graph matching, and regular path queries have limitations in expressing complex structural graph properties. For example, none of them can specify a pattern like "arbitrary length sequence followed by arbitrary size loop".

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Regular Graph Patterns (ReGaPs) as a generalization of graph isomorphism to address these limitations. 
- A ReGaP is a graph that can contain wildcard nodes representing structures like sequences or subgraphs of arbitrary size. It allows compactly specifying infinite sets of possible graph structures.
- The paper formulates the ReGaP matching problem - checking if a target graph matches a given ReGaP specification.
- It encodes ReGaP matching into a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) formula by expanding the wildcards and adding constraints to ensure correct mappings.
- It also proposes a node merging preprocessing technique to simplify the input graph and improve SAT solver performance.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of ReGaP matching problem for expressing complex graph properties
- Novel SAT-based algorithm for ReGaP matching along with preprocessing techniques
- Extensive experimental evaluation on control flow graph benchmarks showing effectiveness of the approach
- Identification of future work like support for more wildcard types, alternative solving methods, tools for ReGaP synthesis etc.

In summary, the paper addresses limitations of existing graph matching techniques through ReGaPs and makes significant contributions towards advancing graph pattern matching capabilities. The SAT-based solution coupled with simplification techniques demonstrates practical effectiveness.
