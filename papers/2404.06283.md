# [LLMs' Reading Comprehension Is Affected by Parametric Knowledge and   Struggles with Hypothetical Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06283)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reading comprehension (RC) tasks are commonly used to evaluate language models' (LMs) natural language understanding capabilities. However, the LMs' extensive parametric knowledge acquired during pre-training can interfere with properly assessing their actual text understanding abilities. 
- When the context aligns with the LMs' knowledge, it's unclear if correct answers stem from comprehending the text or relying on internal knowledge. When the context conflicts with their knowledge, it creates erroneous trends that distort results.

Proposed Solution:
- Use RC on "imaginary data" with made-up facts/entities that don't intersect with the LMs' world knowledge. This neutralizes effects of parametric knowledge, enabling clearer evaluation of linguistic abilities.
- Evaluate LMs on non-affirmative statements involving negation, modals and conditionals. This tests their ability to abstain from answering unanswerable questions based solely on the text.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces "imaginary data" to reliably evaluate LMs' text understanding without interference from parametric knowledge. Experiments validate its effectiveness.
- Shows LMs struggle to correctly understand non-affirmative statements, especially those involving hypotheticals (modals, conditionals). Models often fail to abstain from answering unanswerable questions.
- Re-evaluates context-faithfulness using non-affirmatives. Models that seem faithful on affirmatives still consult parametric knowledge for hypotheticals. 
- More complex semantics correlates with poorer understanding and increased susceptibility to knowledge conflicts.
- Provides frameworks and benchmarks to evaluate text understanding and faithfulness abilities of LMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes using imaginary reading comprehension data to evaluate language models' natural language understanding without interference from their parametric knowledge, and shows language models struggle with understanding hypothetical statements involving modality and conditionals, triggering susceptibility to knowledge conflicts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing to use "imaginary data" based on fictitious facts and entities to evaluate language models' reading comprehension capabilities. This allows assessing their linguistic abilities without interference from the models' parametric knowledge. 

2) Showing that language models struggle to understand non-affirmative statements like negated statements and hypothetical statements expressed through modals and conditionals. This is evidenced by the models failing to abstain from answering questions that are unanswerable from the text alone.

3) Demonstrating that even models that seem context-faithful on affirmative statements become susceptible to relying on their parametric knowledge instead of just the text when faced with non-affirmative statements, especially hypothetical ones.

In summary, the paper highlights issues that language models face in truly understanding texts, especially more complex semantic phenomena beyond simple affirmative statements, and how their parametric knowledge still interferes with their reasoning despite recent progress. The proposed imaginary data evaluation framework allows more accurate assessment of language understanding capabilities.

The paper discusses using imaginary reading comprehension data to evaluate LLMs' natural language understanding capabilities without interference from the models' parametric knowledge. It looks at how well LLMs can understand non-affirmative statements involving negation, modality, and conditionals that express hypothetical scenarios. The study also re-assesses context faithfulness of LLMs on such statements and finds remaining issues in separating textual context from parametric knowledge when interpreting hypothetical statements. Key goals are assessing text understanding, the ability to abstain from answering when appropriate, and context faithfulness in the presence of more complex semantics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using "imaginary data" for evaluating language models' reading comprehension abilities. What are the key benefits of using imaginary data compared to real-world factual or counterfactual data? How does it help isolate the effects of parametric knowledge?

2. When creating the imaginary data, the paper substitutes entities in existing QA datasets with made-up, fake entities. What considerations should go into the process of creating convincing imaginary entities? How can we ensure the imaginary entities are truly novel and do not relate to any real-world knowledge? 

3. The paper finds that models struggle with understanding hypothetical statements like those expressed through modals and conditionals. What specific linguistic phenomena and semantic mechanisms make these constructions challenging for language models? 

4. When models failed to understand hypothetical statements, what were the most common types of errors they made? Did the errors indicate any systematic deficiencies in how models process modal and conditional semantics?

5. For assessing faithfulness to context, the paper stresses the importance of testing models not just on affirmative statements but also on hypothetical ones. Why do hypothetical statements reveal vulnerabilities to knowledge conflicts that affirmative statements do not expose?

6. When confronted with hypothetical statements that conflicted with parametric knowledge, what differing behaviors emerged across the models tested? What do these behaviors reveal about the underlying mechanisms through which models resolve knowledge conflicts?

7. Could the trends in errors across semantic phenomena be explained in terms of differences in the contextual signals that trigger knowledge conflict effects vs. those that trigger abstention?

8. The paper tries several prompting techniques to mitigate knowledge conflict effects. Why do these techniques fall short of fully resolving the issues? What stubborn error patterns persist despite improved overall accuracy?

9. How suitable is the proposed imaginary data method if we want to build models that can handle real-world rather than purely fictional texts? What are some ways the approach could be adapted while preserving the core benefits?

10. What open questions remain about why models struggle with phenomena like modals and conditionals? What specifically should be the focus of future work aimed at improving language understanding in these complex semantic environments?
