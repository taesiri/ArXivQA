# [Reliability in Semantic Segmentation: Can We Use Synthetic Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09231)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores leveraging advanced generative models like Stable Diffusion to automatically synthesize testing data for assessing the reliability of semantic segmentation networks. Specifically, it generates synthetic data exhibiting global covariate shifts (e.g. different weather conditions) and synthetic data with localized out-of-distribution objects inpainted into the scene. Experiments demonstrate high correlation between segmentation performance on synthetic vs real out-of-distribution shift data. This validates the usefulness of synthetic data for initial model screening, ranking, and robustness assessment, without needing real data collection. Additionally, synthetic data is shown to help improve model calibration and out-of-distribution detection abilities. The work encourages further research into synthetic validation frameworks to complement real-world testing. Key advantages are the ability to generate arbitrary rare conditions through prompting and scale data at minimal cost. Limitations include current focus only on segmentation and dependence on the quality of generative models.
