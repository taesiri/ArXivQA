# [TMT-VIS: Taxonomy-aware Multi-dataset Joint Training for Video Instance   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06630)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TMT-VIS, a novel taxonomy-aware multi-dataset joint training framework for video instance segmentation (VIS). The key insight is that simply combining multiple VIS datasets leads to diluted attention across different taxonomies. To address this, TMT-VIS incorporates explicit taxonomy guidance into the model. It consists of two modules - the Taxonomy Compilation Module (TCM) which compiles likely taxonomy labels from the input video using a CLIP text encoder, and the Taxonomy Injection Module (TIM) which injects the compiled taxonomy embeddings into the decoder queries via cross-attention. This provides the queries taxonomic guidance to focus better on relevant categories. The model is trained with an additional taxonomy-aware matching loss. Extensive experiments on multiple VIS benchmarks including YouTube-VIS, OVIS and UVO show that TMT-VIS sets new state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming prior VIS methods. Ablations validate the efficacy of the taxonomy compilation and injection modules. The consistent gains demonstrate the effectiveness of TMT-VIS in utilizing multiple datasets by incorporating semantic taxonomy guidance into the queries.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a taxonomy-aware multi-dataset joint training method (TMT-VIS) for video instance segmentation that effectively leverages multiple datasets by incorporating taxonomic guidance into the transformer decoder to help queries concentrate on desired categories.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The paper proposes TMT-VIS, a novel taxonomy-aware multi-dataset joint training algorithm for video instance segmentation. TMT-VIS can effectively train and utilize multiple datasets by incorporating taxonomy guidance into the DETR-based model.

2. The paper develops a two-stage module consisting of the Taxonomy Compilation Module (TCM) and the Taxonomy Injection Module (TIM). TCM compiles taxonomy information from the input video using a text encoder, while TIM injects this taxonomy guidance into the decoder queries. 

3. Extensive experiments are conducted on four popular VIS benchmarks - YouTube-VIS 2019/2021, OVIS, and UVO. TMT-VIS achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. The new state-of-the-art results are also set on these datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing TMT-VIS to enable effective multi-dataset joint training for video instance segmentation by incorporating taxonomic guidance. The well-designed two-stage taxonomy aggregation module and the superior performance validate this contribution.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Training video instance segmentation (VIS) models requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain. Existing VIS datasets are isolated and have heterogeneous taxonomies. Simply aggregating multiple datasets leads to poorer performance as it dilutes models' attention across different categories. Thus, the key challenge is to increase data scale and taxonomy diversity while improving classification accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Taxonomy-aware Multi-dataset joint Training for VIS (TMT-VIS) to address this challenge. TMT-VIS incorporates extra taxonomy guidance into DETR-based models to help concentrate on relevant categories when training on multiple VIS datasets. 

It has two key modules - Taxonomy Compilation Module (TCM) and Taxonomy Injection Module (TIM). TCM uses a CLIP text encoder and spatio-temporal adapters to compile likely taxonomy embeddings from the input video. TIM then injects these embeddings into the decoder queries via cross-attention before decoding, providing taxonomic guidance. An additional taxonomy-aware matching loss supervises this injection.  

Main Contributions:
- Analyzes limitations of existing VIS methods for multi-dataset training and proposes a taxonomy-aware framework TMT-VIS to effectively utilize multiple datasets.
- Develops a two-stage taxonomy aggregation module - TCM to compile taxonomy from videos, and TIM to inject it into decoder queries as guidance. 
- Evaluates extensively on YouTube-VIS 2019/2021, OVIS and UVO datasets. TMT-VIS sets new state-of-the-art, outperforming Mask2Former-VIS by 3.3-5.8% in absolute AP, demonstrating its effectiveness.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel taxonomy-aware training strategy for effectively leveraging multiple VIS datasets in DETR-based models, through compiling and injecting taxonomic guidance. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.
