# [Deep Evolutional Instant Interest Network for CTR Prediction in   Trigger-Induced Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on a new and emerging recommendation scenario called Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR). In TIR, users explicitly express their instant interests via a "trigger" item, such as by clicking on an item. For example, in e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Amazon, when a user clicks on an item, they are taken to a "Mini Detail" page showing recommendations related to that trigger item. 

Traditional recommendation methods fail to effectively model the user's instant interest induced by the trigger item, leading to sub-optimal results in TIR scenarios. Some recent methods consider the trigger and target items simultaneously, but still do not take into account important factors like the temporal information of user behaviors, the dynamic change of user interest as they scroll through recommendations, and interactions between the trigger and targets.

Proposed Solution - Deep Evolutional Instant Interest Network (DEI2N):

The paper proposes a novel Deep Evolutional Instant Interest Network (DEI2N) to address the limitations of existing methods for CTR prediction in TIR. The key components of DEI2N include:

- User Instant Interest Modeling Layer: Predicts the dynamic change in intensity of the user's instant interest triggered by the item as they scroll through recommendations. It controls the proportion of related vs. non-related items.

- User Soft/Hard Interest Modeling Layers: Extract the user's interests from their historical behaviors with respect to the trigger and target items. Enhanced using mechanisms like self-attention and temporal behavior modeling.

- Fusing Interest Layer: Combines the user's evolutional instant interests and historical interests.

- Interaction Layer: Learns explicit feature interactions between the trigger and target items.

Together, these components allow DEI2N to effectively model the triggered instant interest of the user, while taking into account evolution of interest, temporal dynamics, and trigger-target interactions.

Main Contributions:

- Highlights an important emerging recommendation scenario called Trigger-Induced Recommendations (TIR) with unique challenges.

- Proposes a novel model DEI2N that can effectively predict click-through rate in TIR scenarios by modeling user instant interest and its evolution.

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three real-world datasets compared to existing methods.

- Deployed successfully in 5 different TIR scenarios in Alibaba's production systems, improving key business metrics over baseline.

In summary, the paper makes noteworthy research and practical contributions in an emerging recommendation scenario using a sophisticated neural approach tailored for modeling instant and evolving user interests.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel deep learning method called Deep Evolutional Instant Interest Network (DEI2N) to accurately predict click-through rates in trigger-induced recommendation scenarios by modeling the dynamic change of user instant interests, temporal information, and interactions between trigger and target items.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It emphasizes an emerging industrial recommendation scenario called Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR), and highlights the challenges of existing CTR methods applied in TIR.

2. It proposes a novel method called DEI2N that improves CTR performance in TIR by considering the dynamic change of user instant interest, temporal information of user behaviors, and interactions between the trigger and target items.

3. It evaluates DEI2N on three real-world industrial datasets, showing it achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments further verify the effectiveness of proposed components.  

4. It implements DEI2N in industrial production environments and launches it in five TIR scenes. Online A/B testing shows it outperforms the existing baseline method.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the DEI2N method to better model user instant interest in the emerging TIR recommendation scenario, and demonstrating its effectiveness both offline and in real-world online environments.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR): An emerging recommendation scenario where users explicitly express interest via a "trigger" item, common in e-commerce apps. The paper focuses on this scenario.

- Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction: Estimating the likelihood a recommended item will be clicked. This is crucial for revenue and user satisfaction in TIR. 

- User instant interest: The temporary interest expressed by a user's selection of a trigger item. Modeling this is key for good recommendations in TIR.

- Dynamic change of interest: As a user browses more recommendations after selecting a trigger item, their instant interest evolves. The paper proposes modeling this change.

- Temporal modeling: Incorporating time information from user historical behaviors to better model interests. 

- Interaction modeling: Learning interactions between trigger and target (recommended) items for better relevance.

- Deep Evolutional Instant Interest Network (DEI2N): The proposed neural network model incorporating the above concepts for CTR prediction in TIR.
