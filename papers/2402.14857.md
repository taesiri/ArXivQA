# [Is the System Message Really Important to Jailbreaks in Large Language   Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14857)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introducing a novel perspective by examining the role of system messages in LLMs security and jailbreak research. The paper shows that system messages play a crucial role in determining the susceptibility of LLMs to jailbreak prompts.

2. Conducting comprehensive tests using gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 to explore the impact of different system messages on jailbreaks. The experiments demonstrate that models with varying system messages exhibit distinct behaviors and resistance levels against the same jailbreak prompts. 

3. Proposing the System Messages Evolutionary Algorithm (SMEA) to search for optimal system messages that can effectively mitigate the risks of jailbreaks. Experimental results validate SMEA's efficacy, with the best system messages able to resist up to 98.9% of jailbreak prompts.

4. Raising the bar for successful jailbreak attacks against LLMs by optimizing system messages. This forces adversaries to reconsider tactics and evolve more sophisticated jailbreak methods.

In summary, the key innovation is unveiling system messages as a crucial but overlooked aspect influencing LLMs security, and leveraging evolution algorithms to bolster robustness against jailbreak prompts. This enhances LLMs safety while catalyzing new advancements in adversarial attacks research.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two System Message Evolutionary Algorithms, SMEA-R and SMEA-C. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these two algorithms, how they operate, and their relative advantages and disadvantages?  

2. The use of evolutionary algorithms for optimizing system messages is an interesting approach. What motivated this choice compared to other optimization techniques, and how well suited are evolutionary algorithms for this particular problem?

3. The evaluation methodology utilizes Attack Success Rates and number of jailbreaks. Can you discuss the reasoning behind selecting these metrics and whether you see any limitations or potential issues with relying solely on them? 

4. The paper finds that merely substituting system messages with synonymous sentences can make jailbreak prompts ineffective. What implications does this have both for jailbreaking techniques and system message optimization?

5. System messages are shown to play a significant role in LLMs' vulnerability to jailbreaking. In your view, what are the key attributes or properties of system messages that determine how resistant an LLM will be?

6. Could you elaborate on the prompts utilized for rephrasing and crossover during the generation steps of SMEA? How were these designed and what considerations influenced their formulation?  

7. The system message populations exhibit different degrees of variance - what factors drive this and how does variance potentially impact an optimized set of system messages? Is high or low variance preferable?

8. The threat model appears focused on textual or language-based jailbreaking attacks. What other modalities like images may need to be considered in future work? How might system messages play a role there?

9. The Security Transferability of System Messages (STSM) metric measures mobility of jailbreak prompts across system configurations. Can you discuss this metric in more depth and how it could be utilized?

10. This approach searches for robust system messages in a blackbox manner suitable for commercial LLMs. How might the methodology change if applied to open-source models where parameters could be directly inspected or modified?
