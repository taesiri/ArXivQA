# [A learning-based mathematical programming formulation for the automatic   configuration of optimization solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the Algorithm Configuration Problem (ACP) of finding optimal configurations for mathematical programming (MP) solvers on a per-instance basis. MP solvers have many tunable parameters that can significantly impact performance, but manually finding good configurations is difficult. The goal is to automatically and efficiently select good parameter configurations for individual problem instances. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a two-phase approach:

1. Performance Map Learning Phase (PMLP): Use supervised machine learning on a dataset of instance features, solver configurations, and performance metrics to learn a model predicting solver performance as a function of instance features and configurations.

2. Configuration Space Search Problem (CSSP): Formulate the search for the optimal configuration as a mathematical program using the learned performance model from the PMLP. Additional constraints enforce valid configurations. Solving this yields the best configuration for a new instance.

The key novelty is formulating the CSSP as an optimization problem leveraging the mathematical structure of the learned performance model, allowing integration of configuration constraints and efficient solving with standard solvers.

Main Contributions:

- Novel formulation of the ACP configuration search as a mathematical program using the explicit structure of a learned performance model
- Ability to seamlessly add configuration constraints to the CSSP
- Promising experimental results configuring CPLEX solver parameters on hydro unit commitment instances
- Analysis of different performance map learning methods and feature selection techniques
- Demonstration of a methodology conflating machine learning and mathematical programming for algorithm configuration

The results show the approach can find better CPLEX configurations than default on the test instances in terms of primal-dual gaps. The methodology is general and could be applied to configure other solvers and algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a methodology that uses machine learning to learn a performance function mapping instance features and algorithm configurations to performance, formulates a mathematical program using this performance function to find the optimal configuration for a new instance, and applies this approach to automatically configure parameters of the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimizer for solving hydro unit commitment problems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new methodology for automatically configuring optimization solvers by combining machine learning and mathematical programming. Specifically:

1) In the Performance Map Learning Phase (PMLP), supervised machine learning (e.g. support vector regression) is used to learn a performance function that maps features of an instance and solver configuration to a measure of the solver's efficiency/effectiveness. 

2) The formal model underlying the machine learning methodology is translated into a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). This yields the Configuration Set Search Problem (CSSP) which, for a new unseen instance, finds the solver configuration that optimizes the learned performance function.

3) The key novelty is formulating the configuration search as an optimization problem rather than using black-box heuristics. This allows enforcing hard constraints on compatible configurations and solving efficiently with standard solvers.

4) The approach is demonstrated by configuring CPLEX to solve hydro unit commitment instances. Results show the learned configurations typically have better primal/dual gaps compared to CPLEX's default.

In summary, the main contribution is a learning-based optimization methodology for automatic algorithm configuration that leverages the mathematical structure for efficiency and scalability.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Automatic algorithm configuration
- Mathematical programming 
- Machine learning
- Optimization solver configuration
- Hydro unit commitment
- Performance map learning phase
- Configuration set search problem
- Mixed-integer nonlinear program
- Support vector regression
- Algorithm configuration problem

The paper proposes a methodology for automatically selecting good configurations for mathematical programming solvers by using machine learning to learn a performance function mapping features of instances and solver configurations to a measure of solver performance. This is then formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program called the Configuration Set Search Problem to find the optimal configuration for a new instance. The approach is tested on configuring the CPLEX solver for instances of the Hydro Unit Commitment problem using support vector regression and the Bonmin solver.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-phase approach involving a Performance Map Learning Phase (PMLP) and a Configuration Set Search Problem (CSSP). Could you elaborate more on why this two-phase approach was chosen rather than a single-phase approach? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

2. Support Vector Regression (SVR) was used in the PMLP. Could you explain why SVR was selected over other regression techniques? What properties of SVR make it suitable for this application? 

3. Feature selection was found to significantly impact the computational tractability of solving the CSSP. However, different feature selection techniques led to tradeoffs in solution quality on in-sample vs out-of-sample instances. How can this tradeoff be balanced? Are there ways to improve generalizability?  

4. The CSSP formulation using the SVR model results in a nonconvex MINLP. What techniques were used to solve this problem and avoid getting stuck in local optima? How scalable is this approach as the number of parameters increases?

5. Custom error metrics were introduced, such as cMAE, instead of traditional error metrics like MAE. What motivated this decision and why did the custom metrics perform better in some cases?

6. The results show the configurations found using this approach provide better primal/dual gaps compared to CPLEX's default configuration. However, feasibility was slightly worse. How can this tradeoff between optimality and feasibility be managed?

7. The pipeline involves several components with their own configurable hyperparameters, such as the SVR model, solvers, error metrics, etc. How were the settings for each component determined? Is the whole pipeline sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters?

8. The experiments were conducted on instances of the Hydro Unit Commitment problem using CPLEX parameters. How transferable is this approach to other problem domains and solvers? What customization is required?

9. The training data came from random generator designed to produce realistic instances. Do you think actual historical data would improve the generalizability of the performance model to new unseen instances?

10. The approach found superior configurations in a matter of seconds. Could online adaptation be explored by continuously updating the model based on new solves and re-solving the CSSP periodically?
