# [Panel Transitions for Genre Analysis in Visual Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding how humans create and perceive multimedia narratives is important for media studies and production. 
- Prior work has focused more on low-level features rather than connecting them to higher-level narrative semantics.
- There is a lack of annotated datasets that capture subjective high-level narrative patterns to train computational models. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use manga (Japanese comics) as a testbed since it combines visual and textual modes of storytelling.
- Manually annotate a dataset of manga books with panel transition labels based on comic theorist Scott McCloud's framework. Transitions indicate shifts between panels along dimensions like time, space, action, etc.
- Train a computational model to automatically label panel transitions in unseen manga.
- Analyze the patterns of transitions, including through clustering and frequent sequence mining, to study the narrative structure.
- Show that transition features can improve computational detection of manga genres, which represent different narrative arcs.

Main Contributions:
- Manga panel transition dataset with reliability analysis of subjective labels
- Connection between practitioner-based panel transition theory and computational modeling
- Detailed analysis of panel transitions for computational modeling of narrative patterns 
- Demonstration that panel transitions can improve genre detection in manga
- Overall framework and dataset to spur more research at the intersection of multimedia analytics and narrative semantics

The key insight is that careful annotation and analysis of transitions between comic panels, which control the reader's narrative experience, can unlock new computational ways to study subjective qualities like genres. By releasing the dataset and analysis methods, the authors hope to enable more research in this direction.
