# [Panel Transitions for Genre Analysis in Visual Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08720)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a novel approach for genre analysis of manga-style visual narratives using panel transition features. The authors created an annotated dataset of manga books with labels for high-level narrative patterns based on comic creation best practices. They analyzed a dataset of 109 manga books, annotating over 2,000 pairs of panels with one of six transition types (action-to-action, aspect-to-aspect, etc.). An LSTM-based model was trained on these human annotations to automatically label panel transitions in the rest of the dataset. The transitions were analyzed through clustering to identify patterns and compare against genre labels. Results showed overlaps, suggesting panel transitions capture aspects of genre related to narrative structure. The authors share the annotated dataset, analysis methods, and case study of using transitions to improve manga genre detection. Key contributions are connecting low-level features to narrative semantics through practitioner terminology, providing the workflow and dataset to support this analysis, and demonstrating the value of structural features for classifying subjective qualities like genre. Overall, this work advances computational understanding of visual narrativeartifacts.
