# [EPIC Fields: Marrying 3D Geometry and Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08731)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we combine 3D geometry and video understanding to enable new capabilities in action recognition, video object segmentation, and novel view synthesis?Specifically, the authors aim to address the lack of suitable datasets and benchmarks for studying 3D geometry and video understanding together. They do this by:1) Introducing EPIC-Fields, an augmentation of the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset with 3D camera poses and other geometric information. This required developing methods to accurately reconstruct the cameras in challenging egocentric videos. 2) Proposing benchmark tasks that combine 3D geometry and video understanding, including dynamic novel view synthesis, unsupervised dynamic object segmentation, and semi-supervised video object segmentation.3) Evaluating strong baselines on these benchmarks to probe the limits of current methods and motivate further research in this area. Overall, the central hypothesis is that jointly modeling 3D geometry and semantics will enable new capabilities in action recognition, video object segmentation, and rendering novel views of dynamic scenes. The paper introduces a dataset and benchmarks to test this hypothesis and drive further progress.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The introduction of EPIC-Fields, a new dataset that augments the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset with 3D camera pose information. The authors successfully reconstruct camera poses for 96% of the videos in EPIC-KITCHENS, resulting in over 18 million registered video frames with estimated poses. 2. A method for reconstructing camera poses from egocentric videos capturing dynamic events and interactions. The authors propose pre-processing the videos by intelligently subsampling frames to improve the reliability and speed of the reconstruction process.3. Three new benchmark tasks that combine 3D geometry and video understanding:- Dynamic new view synthesis: Reconstructing held-out frames given other frames and poses.- Unsupervised dynamic object segmentation: Identifying which objects are moving independently without supervision.- Video object segmentation: Propagating object segments from a reference frame using the 3D information.4. Strong baselines and analysis for these tasks using state-of-the-art techniques. The results demonstrate the challenges posed by EPIC-Fields and that there is significant room for improvement, especially for modeling dynamic content.5. Demonstrating the value of 3D geometry for semi-supervised video object segmentation on the VISOR dataset.In summary, the main contribution is the new EPIC-Fields dataset and benchmarks to drive further progress at the intersection of 3D geometry and video understanding. The paper also makes technical contributions like the pose estimation method and analysis of limitations of current techniques.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper introduces EPIC-Fields, an extension of the EPIC-KITCHENS video dataset that adds reconstructed 3D camera poses and proposes benchmark tasks to explore combining 3D geometry and video understanding; the results on these benchmarks showcase current limitations, especially for dynamic content, and aim to motivate further research at this intersection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of geometric computer vision and neural rendering:- The key contribution is augmenting EPIC-KITCHENS with 3D camera poses and introducing new benchmarks using this data. This is a novel dataset that fills an important gap - most other datasets for neural rendering tend to have short videos (<1 minute) or static backgrounds, while EPIC-KITCHENS has long, egocentric videos with heavy object interactions. - The 3D reconstruction approach builds off classic SfM methods like COLMAP, but makes innovations like intelligent frame filtering to handle the challenges of dynamic egocentric videos. Other recent works have explored using additional modalities like IMUs to aid egocentric 3D reconstruction. This work purely relies on monocular video.- For neural rendering, this paper compares methods like NeRF-W, NeuralDiff, and an extended T-NeRF baseline. These reflect the current state-of-the-art in dynamic view synthesis. The benchmarks reveal limitations in handling complex object motions, highlighting room for innovation.- For the semantic tasks like segmentation, this paper explores intuitive ways 3D geometry could aid video understanding. The VOS example of projecting masks into 3D shows promise. Other papers have explored joint 3D-semantic modeling more explicitly, but not on a dataset of this scale.- Overall, this paper makes solid contributions in terms of a novel dataset and sensible baselines. The benchmarks effectively demonstrate where current techniques fall short, motivating future work to address the challenges introduced by this data. The scale and complexity seem to push the limits beyond most existing dynamic 3D-semantic datasets.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving the handling of dynamic objects in neural rendering approaches. The authors point out limitations in current methods, especially when rendering novel views of dynamic foreground regions. Developing techniques to better model and render dynamic objects is an area for future work.- Exploring the integration of geometric and semantic information more fully. The authors propose benchmarks combining 3D geometry and video understanding, but note there is much more potential in leveraging these complementary cues together. - Studying egocentric activities more holistically in 3D. The paper focuses mainly on individual frames, but understanding the 3D trajectories, objects, and hand poses over longer temporal extents is an interesting direction. - Generalizing the camera estimation approach to other challenging egocentric datasets. The preprocessing and filtering steps used here could potentially help with reconstruction in other difficult first-person videos.- Defining additional benchmarks that combine 3D and semantics. The authors provide a few initial benchmarks, but many other options exist to explore interactions between geometry, video, and semantics.- Improving semi-supervised video segmentation using 3D information. The simple 3D propagation baseline shows promise, suggesting more sophisticated techniques could further exploit 3D geometry.- Developing better metrics for evaluating dynamic neural rendering. The PSNR used here has limitations, so creating better perceptual metrics tailored to novel view synthesis of complex scenes would help benchmark progress.In summary, the key areas suggested are: better handling of dynamics in neural rendering, fusing 3D geometry and semantics more deeply, leveraging 3D for video understanding tasks, and developing better metrics and benchmarks for these goals. The new dataset introduced provides a good testbed for pursuing these research directions.
