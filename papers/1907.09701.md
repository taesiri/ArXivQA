# [Benchmarking Attribution Methods with Relative Feature Importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09701)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we quantitatively evaluate and benchmark the correctness of different attribution methods for explaining machine learning model predictions?

The key points are:

- Currently there is a lack of ground truth data on the true importance of input features for model predictions. This makes it hard to quantitatively evaluate the correctness of attribution methods.

- The authors propose a framework called BAM (Benchmarking Attribution Methods) for evaluating attribution methods using models and data where relative feature importance is known by construction.

- BAM includes: (1) A semi-natural image dataset where objects are artificially pasted onto scenes to create common features of known relative importance. (2) Models trained on this dataset where feature importance can be controlled. (3) Metrics to quantitatively compare attributions from different methods using the models and data.

- The metrics evaluate attribution differences between pairs of models and pairs of inputs based on the constructed relative feature importance. This tests whether methods correctly attribute less importance to less important features.

- Evaluation of several attribution methods suggests some methods are more prone to false positive explanations, assigning higher attributions to less important features. The rankings of methods also differ based on the choice of metric.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed BAM framework enables quantitative benchmarking and evaluation of attribution methods using constructed data where relative feature importance is known. The metrics can reveal differences in how prone methods are to false positive explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework for Benchmarking Attribution Methods (BAM) to quantitatively evaluate and compare different attribution methods for interpreting machine learning models. The key components of the framework are:

1) A carefully crafted dataset and models trained with known relative feature importance. The dataset contains images with objects pasted onto scenes, where the objects act as "common features" with controlled relative importance to the models. 

2) Three complementary metrics to evaluate attribution methods by comparing feature attributions between pairs of models and pairs of inputs:

- Model contrast score (MCS): Compares attribution differences for the same input between two models where a feature is more or less important.

- Input dependence rate (IDR): Compares attribution differences for a model between two inputs, one with and without the common feature. 

- Input independence rate (IIR): Compares attribution differences for a model between two functionally similar inputs (that produce the same model output).

3) Evaluation of several widely used attribution methods like GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, Guided Backprop using the proposed framework. The results reveal differences between methods in terms of their tendency to produce false positive explanations.

In summary, the key contribution is a quantitative evaluation framework and dataset for systematically benchmarking and comparing attribution methods based on controlled relative feature importance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called BAM for quantitatively evaluating attribution methods, which includes a dataset and models with controlled relative feature importance and metrics that compare attributions between models and inputs to test for false positive explanations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of evaluating attribution methods for interpretability:

- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new framework (BAM) for quantitatively evaluating attribution methods using models and data with known relative feature importance. Most prior work focused on qualitative human evaluations or perturbation-based tests. The BAM framework allows more controlled and efficient quantitative evaluations.

- The BAM dataset with objects overlayed on scenes is quite unique. Most prior work used natural datasets where ground truth feature importance is unknown. The constructed BAM dataset enables testing attribution methods against known relative importance.

- The proposed metrics of model contrast score, input dependence rate, and input independence rate are novel ways to quantitatively measure desirable properties of attribution methods. Other work tended to rely on accuracy drop from feature removal or human judgments. 

- The paper evaluates a range of attribution methods (GradCAM, Vanilla Gradient, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, etc.) using the BAM framework. Most prior evaluations focused on saliency maps or a smaller set of methods. The head-to-head comparison on multiple metrics provides useful insights.

- A limitation is that the semi-synthetic BAM dataset may not fully generalize to real-world images. But the authors provide thoughtful discussion on why performance on BAM can indicate generalization ability.

Overall, this paper pushes forward quantitative evaluation of attribution methods in a more controlled and efficient manner. The BAM framework and metrics offer the community new tools for method validation and selection. The insights from comparing different attribution methods are also valuable. This methodology represents an advance over prior work that relied more on perturbations or human judgments.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing additional quantitative metrics for evaluating attribution methods using the BAM framework. The authors propose 3 metrics in this paper, but say these are just a starting point and more could be developed.

- Applying the BAM framework to evaluate attribution methods for more complex models and datasets beyond the simple dataset created for this paper. The authors say their framework could serve as an easier test before applying methods to real images.

- Conducting human subject experiments to determine thresholds for metrics like IIR that rely on human perception of attribution differences. The authors use a threshold of 10% change but say this could be further calibrated. 

- Studying both false positive and false negative explanations. This paper focuses only on false positives, but future work could also look at when methods incorrectly assign low attributions to important features (false negatives).

- Comparing perturbation-based evaluations to the BAM approach more thoroughly. The authors discuss some differences between these approaches, but more analysis could be done.

- Applying the optimization procedure for generating functionally similar inputs x and x+delta to real datasets beyond the BAM dataset.

- Evaluating a wider range of attribution methods with the BAM framework. Only a subset of methods were evaluated in this paper.

- Developing additional datasets and models with controlled relative feature importance to complement the BAM dataset.

- Studying what evaluation results on synthetic datasets like BAM imply for performance on real datasets. The authors provide some discussion but more work could be done here.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework called BAM (Benchmarking Attribution Methods) for quantitatively evaluating feature attribution methods in machine learning models. The framework includes 1) a carefully crafted dataset of scene images with objects pasted in, along with models trained on this data with known relative feature importance, and 2) three complementary metrics that compare feature attributions between pairs of models and pairs of inputs in order to measure false positives. The metrics evaluate attribution methods on whether they correctly assign lower importance to less important features, such as the pasted object regions. The authors evaluate several attribution methods like GradCAM, Integrated Gradients, and SmoothGrad using the BAM framework. The results show certain methods like Guided Backpropagation tend to incorrectly highlight unimportant features. The rankings of methods also differ based on the choice of evaluation metric. The authors argue their framework provides an efficient quantitative way to benchmark attribution methods before conducting more expensive human evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating feature attribution methods called Benchmarking Attribution Methods (BAM). The framework includes a semi-natural image dataset and trained models with controlled relative feature importance, as well as three metrics for comparing feature attributions between models and inputs. 

The key idea is that while the absolute importance of features is unknown, relative importance can be controlled through dataset construction and model training. For example, object pixels are made more important for a model trained to classify objects versus one trained on scene labels. Using this knowledge, the proposed metrics compare feature attributions between pairs of models and inputs to measure desirable properties like assigning higher importance to more important features. Experiments on several attribution methods suggest certain techniques are more prone to false positive explanations. The authors argue evaluation on their proposed framework provides an efficient pre-check before conducting more expensive human evaluations. Overall, this work demonstrates how dataset construction and quantitative metrics can enable controlled evaluation of feature attribution methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called Benchmarking Attribution Methods (BAM) for quantitatively evaluating attribution methods, which are interpretability techniques that explain model predictions by attributing importance to input features. BAM includes 1) a carefully crafted image dataset where objects are pasted onto scenes, and models trained on this data with controlled relative feature importance between objects and scenes, and 2) three complementary metrics that compare attributions between pairs of models and pairs of inputs based on their known relative feature importance. The three metrics are: model contrast score (MCS) which compares attributions of the same input between two models, input dependence rate (IDR) which compares attributions of an input with and without a common feature, and input independence rate (IIR) which compares attributions between two functionally similar inputs. These metrics quantitatively measure if methods correctly reflect the constructed relative importance - assigning higher attributions to more important features and vice versa. Experiments using BAM to evaluate several attribution methods suggests certain techniques are more prone to producing false positive explanations. The proposed framework and metrics enable quantitative benchmarking of attribution methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper focuses on evaluating and benchmarking attribution methods, which are a type of interpretability method that explains a model's predictions by assigning importance scores to input features. 

- The main problem is that it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate attribution methods and know whether they are producing correct explanations. The lack of ground truth makes it hard to measure if explanations actually reflect the model's reasoning.

- The authors propose a framework called Benchmarking Attribution Methods (BAM) to evaluate attribution methods in a quantitative way, using models and data where relative feature importance is known.

- BAM includes:
  - A semi-natural image dataset where objects (as common features) are pasted onto scenes in a controlled way.
  - Models trained on this dataset where the relative importance of objects vs scenes is known.
  - Metrics that measure whether attribution methods assign importance as expected given the known relative feature importance.

- The metrics compare attributions between pairs of models and inputs in various ways, measuring model dependence, input dependence, and input independence.

- Evaluation of several attribution methods suggests some methods are more prone to false positive explanations, assigning high importance to less relevant features.

- The authors argue their framework provides an efficient quantitative evaluation to identify methods that may produce misleading explanations before involving humans.

In summary, the key problem is evaluating attribution methods quantitatively when ground truth explanations are unknown. BAM provides relative feature importance to serve as a proxy for ground truth in a controlled setting.
