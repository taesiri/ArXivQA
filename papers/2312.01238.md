# [A deep learning pipeline for cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview   data integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01238)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Biomedical research often collects diverse data types (e.g. genomics, metabolomics, clinical data) on the same individuals to understand complex diseases. These data can be a mix of cross-sectional (single timepoint) and longitudinal (multiple timepoints) data.  
- However, methods to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview data are lacking. Existing methods either expect the same data type from all views (cross-sectional only or longitudinal only) or do not use any class/disease labels during integration.
- There is a need for methods that can integrate a mix of longitudinal and cross-sectional data from multiple sources to classify samples into disease groups. This will lead to biological insights into complex disease etiology and heterogeneity.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a novel deep learning pipeline to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview data for classification.
- The pipeline has 3 main steps:
   1) Variable selection to eliminate noise and identify important variables using linear mixed models, DeepIDA-GRU-Bootstrapping or Joint Principal Trend Analysis.
   2) Feature extraction from longitudinal data using Euler Characteristics or Functional PCA. 
   3) Integration of all views and classification into disease groups using DeepIDA combined with Gated Recurrent Units (DeepIDA-GRU).
- Comparisons are made between linear and nonlinear variable selection methods. Comparisons are also made between the feature extraction methods.
- The pipeline is applied to an inflammatory bowel disease study with longitudinal metagenomics & metabolomics data and cross-sectional transcriptomics data.

Main Contributions:  
- Allows integration of a mix of longitudinal and cross-sectional multiview data.
- Incorporates class/disease labels during integration to enable sample classification. 
- Models complex nonlinear relationships between views and classes using deep learning.  
- Compares linear and nonlinear methods for variable selection and feature extraction.
- Can handle missing data.
- Identifies important variables contributing to class separation and view association.
- Provides deeper insights into complex disease etiology.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative deep learning pipeline to integrate multiview biomedical data containing both longitudinal and cross-sectional data views to enable reliable classification and biological discovery. Both statistical and deep learning techniques are combined.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a pipeline combining statistical and deep learning methods for integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal multi-omics data to simultaneously maximize separation between disease classes and association between data views, and identifies key molecular signatures contributing to disease discrimination and view associations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a pipeline for integrating cross-sectional and longitudinal multiview data that combines statistical and deep learning methods. The main contributions include:

1) The pipeline allows integration of a mix of cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources, which has broad utility as many studies generate such heterogeneous data types. 

2) The pipeline enables joint modeling of associations between views and separation between classes (e.g. disease status) during variable selection and data integration. This facilitates identification of variables that discriminate between classes and associate views.

3) The pipeline models complex nonlinear relationships among views and classes using deep learning while also incorporating statistical techniques like variable selection and feature extraction that are sample size friendly.

4) The pipeline can handle missing data through the use of variants of recurrent neural networks like GRU during variable selection and data integration.

5) Through analysis of real and synthetic data, the paper provides guidance on suitable feature extraction techniques to apply prior to data integration depending on characteristics of the longitudinal data.

In summary, the key innovation is the synergistic fusion of statistical and deep learning techniques to integrate heterogeneous multiview data for classification tasks, which overcomes limitations of existing methods and provides interpretability.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a pipeline that combines statistical methods like LMM and JPTA with deep learning methods like DeepIDA-GRU. What are some of the key strengths that statistical methods and deep learning methods bring to the table in this pipeline? How do they complement each other?

2) The paper explores both linear (LMM, JPTA) and nonlinear (DeepIDA-GRU) methods for variable selection and ranking. What are some scenarios where linear methods would be preferred over nonlinear methods and vice versa for this task? 

3) The DeepIDA-GRU method extends DeepIDA using GRUs to handle longitudinal data. What are some of the key advantages and disadvantages of using GRUs compared to other RNN architectures like LSTMs?

4) The paper leverages bootstrap aggregating with DeepIDA-GRU to rank variables. Why is bootstrap aggregating helpful here? What are some potential limitations of using bootstrap?

5) For feature extraction from longitudinal data, the paper explores both EC and FPCA. Under what conditions would you expect EC to outperform FPCA and vice versa?

6) The integration and classification step uses an objective function that simultaneously maximizes class separation and view association. What is the motivation behind this objective? What are some scenarios where maximizing only class separation would be preferred?

7) The paper handles missing data by replacing DeepIDA-GRU's GRU with a variant like MC-GRU. What modifications need to be made in the GRU architecture to handle missing data and what are their limitations? 

8) What customizations would be required to adapt the proposed pipeline to handle more complex longitudinal data with, for example, unequal time points between subjects and views?

9) For real-world multiview biomedical data, what are some practical challenges in directly applying the architectures and hyperparameters used in this paper?

10) The paper validates the method on a small sample size. What steps could be taken to validate the proposed methodology on large scale multiview biomedical data?
