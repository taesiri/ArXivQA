# [Towards A Flexible Accuracy-Oriented Deep Learning Module Inference   Latency Prediction Framework for Adaptive Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06440)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a flexible deep learning module inference latency prediction framework that supports customizable parameter configurations and accuracy-oriented automatic regression model (RM) selection in dynamic environments. A new RM called MEDN (Multi-task Encoder-Decoder Network) is also introduced. The framework categorizes parameters into sampling, measurable, and inferable types to systematically analyze their importance. It allows flexible RM training workflows per module using self-generated datasets. An auto-selection algorithm then chooses the best-performing RMs to maximize overall prediction accuracy and R-squared, while minimizing time and space costs. Comprehensive experiments show MEDN achieves the highest accuracy and efficiency. The auto-selection algorithm further improves accuracy by 2.5% and R-squared by 0.39% over MEDN single-selection. Key advantages are handling larger batch sizes, leveraging device dynamics, and automatically selecting optimized RMs based on accuracy and efficiency trade-offs. Future work involves incorporating more inferable and measurable parameters.
