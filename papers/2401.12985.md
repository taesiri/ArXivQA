# [The Effect of Human v/s Synthetic Test Data and Round-tripping on   Assessment of Sentiment Analysis Systems for Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12985)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentiment analysis systems (SASs) are prone to biases related to protected attributes like gender and race. 
- Recent work has proposed assessing SAS bias using synthetic English data, but this may not show performance in a realistic setting.
- Open questions on comparing bias in human vs synthetic data, relation to human perception of bias, and impact of using composite systems like round-trip translation.

Solution:
- Introduce two new human-generated chatbot conversation datasets (ALLURE, Unibot).
- Consider round-trip translation of text through intermediate languages (Spanish, Danish) before passing to SAS. 
- Test mainstream SAS approaches on human and synthetic datasets, with and without round-tripping, and compare to human annotated sentiment.

Key Findings:
- SASs exhibit more statistical bias on human datasets than synthetic data. 
- Human annotated sentiment shows some confounding bias but no statistical bias.
- Round-trip translation reduces statistical bias for SASs on human data, but increases bias on synthetic data.

Main Contributions:
- First work to compare SAS bias on human vs synthetic conversational data.
- Analysis of how round-trip translation impacts perceived SAS bias.  
- Two new human annotated chatbot conversation datasets for SAS testing.
- Findings and datasets to help refine trust testing strategies for SASs.

In summary, the paper provides a more realistic assessment of SAS bias using human-generated data and composite systems like round-trip translation, with insights to help build more trusted AI systems. The datasets and analysis approach are valuable contributions for future SAS testing research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces human-generated datasets and round-trip translation to augment recent work on rating sentiment analysis systems for bias using only synthetic data, finding that these additional settings provide a more realistic assessment of system performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The authors augmented the recently proposed rating work for sentiment analysis systems (SASs), which used synthetic data, by introducing two human-generated datasets and also considered a round-trip translation setting using intermediate languages (Spanish and Danish). These new settings showed SASs performance in a more realistic light compared to just using synthetic data. Specifically, the authors found that:

1) Rating SASs on the human-generated chatbot data showed more bias compared to rating them on synthetic data. 

2) Round-tripping the data using Spanish and Danish as intermediate languages reduces the bias in human-generated data (up to 68% reduction) while surprisingly increasing the bias in synthetic data.

In summary, the new testing strategies with human-generated data and round-tripping give a more complete picture of potential biases in SASs. The findings will help researchers and practitioners refine their SAS testing methodologies to foster more trust as these systems are adopted in more critical applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces two new human-generated datasets, ALLURE and Unibot, for evaluating sentiment analysis systems. How were these datasets collected and preprocessed for the experiments in this paper? What are some key properties and statistics of these datasets?

2. The paper evaluates sentiment analysis systems on synthetic and human-generated datasets. What were the key differences observed in how systems performed on these two types of datasets? What reasons may account for these differences? 

3. The paper proposes a round-trip translation approach involving translating text from English to another language and back to English. How does this differ from existing techniques for evaluating multilingual sentiment analysis? What effect did round-trip translation have on bias ratings for the systems?

4. The paper introduces a human annotator sentiment analysis system ($S_h$) for comparison. Explain how the annotations were performed. How did the performance and bias rating of $S_h$ on the various datasets compare to the machine systems?

5. What were the causal models used for defining hypotheses about gender and race bias? Explain the formulations for confounding and statistical bias used in the rating methodology.  

6. The rating methodology computes raw scores using weighted rejection scores and deconfounding impact estimates. Explain what these metrics capture. How are the final bias ratings for systems derived from the raw scores?

7. Analyze the results for Research Question 1 about comparing sentiment ratings on human-generated vs synthetic datasets. What key observations support the stated answer to this research question?

8. Analyze the results for Research Question 2 about comparing system ratings to human perceived sentiment. What explanations are provided for the human sentiment system's performance?

9. Analyze the results for Research Question 3 on the impact of round-trip translation. How do the effects differ between synthetic and human-generated datasets? What may account for this?

10. The paper aims to provide a more realistic assessment of sentiment analysis systems. In your view, what are the most important implications of this work for improving evaluation and testing strategies for AI systems regarding bias and fairness?
