# [Opportunities and Risks of LLMs for Scalable Deliberation with Polis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11932)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: What are the opportunities and risks of using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to address challenges with facilitating, moderating and summarizing the results of conversations using the Polis platform for collective deliberation?The key hypotheses explored in the paper appear to be:1) LLMs can augment human intelligence to help run Polis conversations more efficiently. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that capabilities like summarization and topic modeling will enable new methods to empower the public in collective meaning-making exercises. 2) However, the limitations of LLMs, such as restricted context length, will significantly impact the quality and utility of the results.3) There are risks associated with applying LLMs to deliberative systems like Polis that need to be carefully considered and mitigated. The authors seem especially concerned about the potential for bias, misinformation, and lack of transparency.4) Maintaining human feedback loops is vital for the safe and ethical application of LLMs to enhance tools like Polis.In sum, the central research question seems to revolve around assessing the opportunities and risks of using LLMs to augment human intelligence for deliberative platforms like Polis. The key hypotheses focus on the utility of LLMs for this purpose, but also the need for transparency, accountability, and human oversight to ensure the technology is applied responsibly. The paper aims to explore and validate these hypotheses through analysis and experiments.
