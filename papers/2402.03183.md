# [Predicting Configuration Performance in Multiple Environments with   Sequential Meta-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Learning and predicting the performance of configurable software systems under diverse environments (e.g. different workloads, hardware, versions) is important but challenging. Existing work either builds models for a single environment, failing to generalize to new environments, or does not properly handle data from multiple environments. This leads to inaccurate performance predictions and wasted measurement efforts when environments change.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SeMPL, a meta-learning framework to learn performance models from multiple environments that can generalize to new, unseen environments. Unlike parallel meta-learning methods like MAML, SeMPL uses sequential meta-learning to discriminate and prioritize the contributions of each environment when building the meta-model. This is better suited for configuration data where performance distributions can vary greatly across environments. 

Key ideas:
- Assess usefulness of each meta environment using cross-validation performance 
- Rank environments using statistical testing 
- Sequentially update meta-model parameters on each env, prioritizing useful ones
- Enable quick fine-tuning to new target environments

Contributions:
- Justify theoretically and empirically why sequential training suits configuration data better 
- Design a method to select the optimal training sequence of environments 
- Extensive evaluation on 9 systems against 15 state-of-the-art approaches
- Significantly outperforms existing methods on most systems (89%) with up to 99% improved accuracy
- More data-efficient, leading to up to 3.86x speedup in required training data

In summary, SeMPL introduces a new tailored meta-learning approach for learning performance models of configurable systems across environments. By sequential training and discriminating environments, it generalizes substantially better to unseen environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SeMPL, a meta-learning framework for predicting software configuration performance across multiple environments, which sequentially trains on each environment data in a tailored order to discriminate and exploit their distinct contributions when building the meta-model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing SeMPL, a novel meta-learning framework for predicting the performance of software configurations across multiple environments. Specifically:

1) SeMPL uses sequential meta-learning to train on data from different environments (hardware, workloads, versions, etc.) one at a time rather than in parallel. This allows it to discriminate and prioritize the contributions of each environment when building the meta-model.

2) The order of training environments is selected automatically based on an assessment of how useful each one seems to be for generalization to unseen target environments. More useful environments are trained later to preserve more of their information.

3) Extensive experiments on 9 real-world configurable systems show SeMPL significantly outperforms 15 state-of-the-art approaches, improving accuracy by up to 99% and achieving up to 3.86x speedup in data efficiency.

In summary, the key innovation is using sequential meta-learning specifically designed for software configuration data to effectively leverage performance measurements across diverse environments for more accurate and data-efficient prediction.

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- Configurable System
- Machine Learning
- Meta Learning 
- Performance Prediction
- Performance Learning
- Configuration Learning
- Sequential Meta-Learning
- Multi-Environment Configuration Learning

The paper proposes a new framework called SeMPL (Sequential Meta Performance Learning) for learning and predicting configuration performance under multiple environments. Key aspects of the paper include:

- Handling performance prediction for configurable software systems across diverse environments like workloads, hardware, versions, etc.
- Leveraging meta-learning to build a meta-model that can generalize across environments.  
- Using sequential rather than parallel meta-learning to discriminate and prioritize the contributions of different meta environments.
- Experimental evaluation on 9 real-world configurable systems comparing to 15 state-of-the-art techniques.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around meta-learning for configuration performance modeling and prediction across multiple environments in a sequential manner.
