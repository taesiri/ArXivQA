# [WSC+: Enhancing The Winograd Schema Challenge Using Tree-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17703)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Assessing common sense reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is important but also challenging. The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) was designed for this purpose but contemporary LLMs now perform well on it.  
- However, LLMs' ability to generate WSC-style questions remains less explored. Recent methods yield only 10% valid questions.
- LLMs also exhibit biases and unwarranted overconfidence in certain scenarios, indicating inadequacies.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors present WSC+, a novel dataset of 3,026 LLM-generated WSC-style sentences spanning traditional, ambiguous, and offensive categories.
- They introduce Tree-of-Experts (ToE), an innovative prompting method for high-quality WSC+ generation (50% validity vs 10% recently).
- Analysis conducted on WSC+ questions generated by Claude2, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and evaluated by these same LLMs.

Key Contributions:
- WSC+ dataset with traditional, ambiguous and offensive statement types to assess LLMs.
- ToE prompting framework significantly boosts valid WSC+ generation.  
- Concept of generation-evaluation consistency introduced - LLMs struggle on their own generated cases. 
- Analysis reveals nuances in common sense reasoning and biases in LLMs.
- Despite strengths, top-performing LLM GPT-4 scored only 68.7% on WSC+, below 95.1% human benchmark.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions around dataset creation, prompting strategies and analysis to advance common sense reasoning evaluation of large language models. Key gaps persist between human and machine performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents WSC+, a novel dataset of over 3,000 machine-generated Winograd schema questions aimed at evaluating and exposing biases and overconfidence in large language models, as well as a new prompting method called Tree-of-Experts that improves the validity rate of generated questions to 49.3%; analysis reveals inconsistencies between models' abilities to generate vs evaluate questions and significant gaps compared to human performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It unveils WSC+, a new dataset featuring 3,026 LLM-generated Winograd Schema type instances across traditional, ambiguous, and offensive categories. This is designed to challenge LLMs on pronominal coreference resolution while probing biases and overconfidence.

2. It presents Tree-of-Experts (ToE), an innovative prompting method that improves the generation of valid WSC+ sentences to 50% compared to 10% with recent methods. 

3. It explores the novel concept of "generation-evaluation consistency" in LLMs, revealing that models like GPT-3.5 often underperform when evaluating instances they themselves generate compared to those crafted by other models. This suggests potential reasoning disparities between generation and evaluation.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of the new WSC+ dataset and Tree-of-Experts prompting technique, as well as the analysis revealing inconsistencies in how models perform on their own generated content versus that produced by others.

The paper introduces a new dataset called WSC+ for evaluating commonsense reasoning and bias in large language models. It leverages prompt engineering with a novel method called Tree-of-Experts to generate challenging WSC-style sentence pairs. The key contributions analyze the performance of models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on this dataset, propose the concept of generation-evaluation consistency, and identify recurring error patterns like ambiguity misinterpretation. The scope also extends to detecting biases and overconfidence issues in LLMs. Overall, the central focus is on assessing and enhancing commonsense reasoning in language models through datasets like WSC+.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The Tree-of-Experts (ToE) prompting method led to higher validity rates in WSC+ instance generation compared to other methods like Chain-of-Thought. What aspects of ToE's design make it more effective at eliciting valid and logical WSC+ questions from language models?

2. When analyzing the performance of different language models on WSC+, the concept of "generation-evaluation consistency" is introduced. Why does this dimension matter when assessing commonsense reasoning capabilities? What theories could explain the performance discrepancies noticed between a model's evaluation of its own vs. others' generated questions?  

3. When generating the WSC+ dataset, different types of biased and offensive questions were included to test model tendencies. However, the paper notes potential limitations regarding false negatives in detecting biases. What additional strategies could be employed during dataset creation to minimize occurrences of overlooked model biases?

4. The ambiguous category of questions in WSC+ aims to gauge model overconfidence. Yet the performance analysis reveals models demonstrate clear differences in handling ambiguity vs. offensiveness. What factors, either in model design or training data, could explain this discrepancy?

5. The qualitative analysis highlights cases where models arrive at right answers but demonstrate erroneous reasoning. What risks does this pose for real-world model deployment? How can prompt engineering techniques be enhanced to elicit stronger justification chains from models?

6. When probing for offensive questions, the safety mechanisms of certain models were bypassed, revealing unexpected biases, referred to as “bias leakage”. What implications does this have regarding vulnerabilities and lack of robustness in model safety protocols?  

7. The paper notes ambiguity misinterpretation as a key recurring error made by models on WSC+. What architectural limitations in existing models contribute to inferior ambiguity handling? Are there certain design innovations that hold promise?

8. WSC+ currently focuses primarily on the English language. As culture and language are interlinked, what novel challenges or perspectives might be revealed by constructing multilingual variants of the benchmark?

9. The computational demands of evaluating and fine-tuning LLMs poses hurdles to accessibility and scalability. What strategies can boost research participation from groups with constrained computational resources?

10. The reliance on a taxonomy-driven error analysis risks certain oversimplifications or overlooking interconnected error factors. What alternative analytic approaches could offer a more holistic perspective into models’ reasoning gaps?
