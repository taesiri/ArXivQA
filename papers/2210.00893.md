# [Combining Efficient and Precise Sign Language Recognition: Good pose   estimation library is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:How can we improve the accuracy of lightweight sign language recognition models aimed for real-world applications on consumer devices, without increasing their computational requirements?Specifically, the authors focus on boosting the performance of the SPOTER architecture, which is a relatively small and efficient pose-based model, while keeping its efficiency advantages over larger appearance-based models. Their main hypothesis is that simply swapping out the pose estimation library used in SPOTER can lead to significant accuracy improvements. They test this by replacing the original Vision API library with MediaPipe pose estimation.The overall goal is to develop a sign language recognition model that is accurate enough for real-world use cases but still small and fast enough to run on common hardware like smartphones. The authors aim to find a good balance between efficiency and accuracy.In summary, this paper explores whether a better pose estimation library can boost a lightweight sign language recognition model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, without increasing its computational demand. The central hypothesis is that the pose extraction module has a major influence on overall performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a sign language recognition model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being lightweight and fast enough to deploy on consumer devices. Specifically, the authors build on the SPOTER architecture and show that simply by swapping out the pose estimation library from Vision API to MediaPipe, they can boost the accuracy on the WLASL100 dataset from 63.18% to 78.29%. This establishes a new state-of-the-art result with a model that has only half the parameters and is 11x faster compared to previous best methods.Additionally, the authors create the first publicly available online demo for sign language recognition that runs in the browser. This demonstrates the efficiency of their method and provides an accessible tool for translating sign language videos. In summary, the key contributions are:- Showing the impact of the pose estimation library on a pose-based sign language recognition model- Achieving SOTA accuracy on WLASL100 with a lightweight and fast model  - Creating an accessible online demo for sign language translationThe main impact is developing a highly accurate sign language recognition model that is efficient enough to deploy on consumer devices, helping to make this technology more accessible to the Deaf community.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes enhancing the accuracy of a lightweight sign language recognition model by replacing its pose estimation module with MediaPipe, achieving state-of-the-art results on a benchmark dataset while remaining efficient enough to run real-time recognition in a web browser.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in sign language recognition:- This paper builds on previous work using pose-based models for sign language recognition, specifically the SPOTER architecture. The main contribution is showing that simply swapping out the pose estimation library can lead to significant gains in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results on the WLASL100 dataset. - Compared to other pose-based models like GCN-BERT, Pose-TGCN, and Pose-GRU, this approach achieves much higher accuracy on WLASL100 while still being lightweight and efficient. The use of MediaPipe for pose estimation seems to provide better pose representations than other libraries.- The paper shows that with this improved pose estimation, the lightweight SPOTER model can outperform previous state-of-the-art appearance-based models like TK-3D ConvNet and Fusion-3. This is significant because it demonstrates high accuracy is possible even for efficient models suitable for deployment on lower-end devices.- The online demo is novel and enables real-time sign language recognition in the browser, which could be valuable for practical applications. Other papers have not focused as much on building publicly available applications.- One limitation is that the experiments are so far only on the WLASL100 dataset, which is one of the smaller benchmarks. Evaluation on larger and more challenging datasets would provide a clearer picture of how the approach compares.Overall, the work makes a solid incremental contribution in improving the accuracy of lightweight models by swapping the pose estimation component. The results demonstrate these efficient models can potentially match or surpass the state-of-the-art, which is very relevant for deploying sign language recognition practically. More comprehensive experiments on larger datasets would further substantiate the claims.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Evaluate other major pose estimation libraries in a similar fashion to MediaPipe. The authors suggest doing more thorough experiments and qualitative analyses when comparing different pose estimation tools.- Explore modifications to the SPOTER architecture itself, beyond just changing the pose estimation module. The authors kept the original SPOTER model unchanged to isolate the effects of the pose estimation swap, but suggest further architecture improvements could boost performance.- Extend the approach to larger datasets beyond WLASL100 and to continuous sign language recognition. The current work focuses only on isolated sign recognition on a small 100-class subset.- Improve the demo application for real-world usage. The authors mention the demo could be extended as an educational tool, search interface, etc.- Evaluate the approach on other sign languages besides American Sign Language. The data and experiments in the paper are specific to ASL.- Investigate deployment to actual consumer devices like smartphones. The work shows computational efficiency that could enable on-device inference, but this is not demonstrated.- Collect additional evaluation metrics like model size, latency, etc. The paper reports mainly accuracy results.So in summary, the core suggestions are around more extensive experiments with pose estimation, architectural improvements to SPOTER, testing on larger/more diverse datasets, and conducting more real-world validation and deployment of the approach. The overall goal is pushing closer to highly accurate and efficient sign language recognition that can practically benefit Deaf users.
