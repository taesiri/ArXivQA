# [Combining Efficient and Precise Sign Language Recognition: Good pose   estimation library is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is:How can we improve the accuracy of lightweight sign language recognition models aimed for real-world applications on consumer devices, without increasing their computational requirements?Specifically, the authors focus on boosting the performance of the SPOTER architecture, which is a relatively small and efficient pose-based model, while keeping its efficiency advantages over larger appearance-based models. Their main hypothesis is that simply swapping out the pose estimation library used in SPOTER can lead to significant accuracy improvements. They test this by replacing the original Vision API library with MediaPipe pose estimation.The overall goal is to develop a sign language recognition model that is accurate enough for real-world use cases but still small and fast enough to run on common hardware like smartphones. The authors aim to find a good balance between efficiency and accuracy.In summary, this paper explores whether a better pose estimation library can boost a lightweight sign language recognition model to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, without increasing its computational demand. The central hypothesis is that the pose extraction module has a major influence on overall performance.
