# [On the Completeness of Invariant Geometric Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04836)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Invariant geometric deep learning models like SchNet are capable of generating useful representations by incorporating geometric features. However, their theoretical expressiveness is not well understood.
- Recent works have shown SchNet is not complete - it fails to distinguish some symmetric graphs. So it's unclear if more expressive invariant models like DimeNet and GemNet can achieve completeness. 

Main Contributions:
- Provides a detailed characterization of when the simplest invariant model, Vanilla DisGNN, fails. Shows all its unidentifiable cases are highly symmetric graphs with only one "global anchor".
- Introduces a new simple but complete invariant model, GeoNGNN, by enhancing Vanilla DisGNN to handle symmetric cases using "local anchors".
- Leverages GeoNGNN to prove several well-known invariant models like DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet can achieve completeness under certain conditions.
- Experimentally evaluates GeoNGNN, showing it has competitive performance and faster speed compared to models using high-order representations.

In summary, the paper narrows the gap between theory and practice of invariant geometric models by formally characterizing their expressiveness. The results suggest the geometric graph isomorphism problem is fundamentally easier, and common invariant models have potential to achieve completeness. The introduced GeoNGNN serves as a simple yet powerful baseline for future research.
