# [Coercing LLMs to do and reveal (almost) anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14020)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper provides a broad overview of diverse adversarial attack objectives against large language models beyond jailbreaking that coerce unintended behaviors like misdirection, control, denial-of-service, or data extraction, analyzes attack mechanisms and success rates, and concludes that the security of language models must be addressed through comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is providing a broad overview of the spectrum of possible adversarial attacks against large language models (LLMs) beyond just jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, it discusses, categorizes and systematizes various types of attacks that can coerce unintended behaviors from LLMs, such as misdirection, model control, denial-of-service, or data extraction. 

The paper analyzes these different attacks through concrete examples and controlled experiments. It finds that many stem from training LLMs with coding capabilities and from the existence of "glitch" tokens in vocabularies. The authors conclude that the space of adversarial attacks against LLMs is much broader than previously thought, and security measures should comprehensively address the capabilities and limitations of these models.

In summary, the key contribution is broadening the understanding of adversarial threats to LLMs beyond alignment bypassing, providing a structured overview of attacks, analyzing commonalities and mechanisms exploited, and arguing for the need to re-assess model security given the ease of attack coercion.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper examines how adversarial attacks can coerce large language models (LLMs) into a broad range of unintended and potentially harmful behaviors, beyond just generating toxic or dangerous text. Specifically, the authors categorize and demonstrate attacks for objectives like information extraction, misdirection through generated URLs or instructions, denial-of-service to exhaust computational resources, seizing control of the model, and alignment bypassing. 

Through concrete examples optimized using a gradient-based attack algorithm, the authors showcase extraction attacks to reveal private system prompts, misdirection attacks to provide fake refunds or phishing links, control attacks to force model shutdown, and more complex alignment-bypassing attacks. By analyzing common themes in attack token usage, the authors find these attacks stem from the practice of pre-training LLMs with coding capabilities and the existence of problematic "glitch" tokens that induce unintended behavior.

The authors conclude that the spectrum of possible adversarial attacks against LLMs is much broader than previously thought. They argue that with free-form text input, LLM responses can be coerced into almost anything technically feasible, highlighting risks for applications beyond just text generation. Ultimately, securing LLMs likely requires comprehensive understanding of their capabilities and limitations, rather than defenses targeting only narrowly-defined attacks.
