## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Distinguishing between fine-grained skeleton-based actions (e.g. "Reading" vs "Writing") is challenging as the subtle differences in motion patterns tend to get overshadowed by salient motion features during feature extraction. Existing methods operate in the spatiotemporal domain and fail to effectively disentangle and enhance these subtle motion features that are most discriminative for confusing fine-grained actions. 

Proposed Solution: The authors propose a Wavelet-Decoupling Contrastive Enhancement Network (WDCE-Net) that leverages discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to map skeleton features into the time-frequency domain and decouple them into salient features and subtle features. A Wavelet-Attention Decoupling (WAD) module performs the DWT and uses a decoupling attention mechanism to recalibrate the features. The subtle features are then fed into a Fine-grained Contrastive Enhancement (FCE) module that uses a trajectory-wise attention mechanism and prototype contrastive loss to further enhance the discriminability of subtle motion features between different classes. Finally, the salient and enhanced subtle features are fused for classification.

Main Contributions:
- Propose WAD module to effectively decouple salient and subtle motion features in the time-frequency domain using DWT and decoupling attention.
- Propose FCE module to further amplify discrepancies in subtle features using trajectory-wise attention and prototype contrastive loss. 
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained skeleton dataset FineGYM and significant improvements over existing methods in distinguishing confusing fine-grained actions.

The key novelty is the use of time-frequency domain and contrastive learning techniques to specifically enhance subtle motion features critical for fine-grained action recognition.
