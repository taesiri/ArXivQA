# [Fluidic FlowBots: Intelligence embodied in the characteristics of   recirculating fluid flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05198)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of "FlowBots", a new class of soft robots that utilize continuous recirculating fluid flow to embed control functionality directly into the structure of the robot. By leveraging fluid characteristics like pressure drops from viscous losses or inertia, FlowBots can achieve complex behaviors with simpler control architectures compared to traditional soft robots. The authors demonstrate three FlowBot examples: a bidirectional actuator using asymmetric pressure distributions, a gripper switching between parallel and series actuator configurations, and a swimming quadruped with fully embedded control in its monolithic printed structure. A key advantage of FlowBots is their ability to be manufactured as a single part with no moving components, enabling rapid prototyping, environmental sustainability, and a wide range of applications. The concepts explored lay the foundations for an emerging field of soft robotic systems designed around recirculating fluid flow to embody intelligence.
