# [Towards General-Purpose Speech Abilities for Large Language Models Using   Unpaired Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06753)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an end-to-end approach to extend the capabilities of an instruction-tuned large language model to speech input without using carefully curated paired data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an approach to extend large language models (LLMs) with end-to-end speech processing abilities, while maintaining the original text capabilities of the LLM. The method equips an instruction-tuned LLM (Llama-2-chat) with an audio encoder, and aligns it using unpaired speech data from an automatic speech recognition dataset. Specifically, the transcripts are used to prompt the LLM to generate responses, creating (audio, response) pairs for training. This modal-invariance approach induces the LLM to generate the same responses to speech or text prompts with the same semantic meaning. Experiments show the model performs on par or better than a cascaded speech recognition + LLM system in generating appropriate responses. Key advantages are the ability to sustain dialogues using speech or text interchangeably, and leverage context to aid recognition. Limitations include the simple audio encoder, and use of a segmented speech dataset. Overall, the end-to-end model extends the LLM's text capabilities to the speech domain without compromising original functionality.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes an end-to-end approach to equip large language models (LLMs) like Llama-2 with general-purpose speech processing abilities, without relying on carefully curated paired speech-text datasets. The model architecture consists of an audio encoder to extract speech features and the pretrained Llama-2 LLM which is kept frozen. To align the audio and text, they leverage a modal-invariance approach - feeding the LLM text prompts and corresponding responses as (audio, response) pairs. This allows extending all LLM text capabilities to audio in a conversational setting. Without transcribing speech to text, their model can directly take audio prompts and leverage context over multiple rounds of dialogue. Results show it matches or outperforms cascaded ASR+LLM models in metrics like response perplexity. The model also shows new cross-modal capabilities like speech translation, summarization, and seamlessly switching between text and speech inputs during a conversation. Overall, it's an end-to-end approach to add general speech abilities to LLMs using only unpaired data.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we extend large language models with end-to-end speech processing and reasoning abilities, while maintaining their wide range of capabilities, without using carefully curated paired data?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By equipping an instruction-tuned LLM with an audio encoder, it can directly process speech representations and generate responses. 

2) By using a "modal invariance" approach on unpaired data, the model can learn to generate the same responses to spoken or textual prompts with the same semantic meaning.

3) This approach can enable the LLM to use speech as input while preserving its broad existing capabilities like question answering, translation, reasoning, etc.

4) The end-to-end model will be more robust than a cascaded system relying on an external speech recognition module.

So in summary, the central research question is how to extend LLMs to handle speech in an end-to-end manner while maintaining their capabilities, without relying on paired speech-text data. The key hypotheses focus on using an audio encoder and modal invariance training to align the speech and text domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to extend a large language model (LLM) with general-purpose speech processing and reasoning abilities, while maintaining the model's original text-based capabilities. The key points are:

- They start with an instruction-tuned conversational LLM (Llama-2-chat) and equip it with an audio encoder to handle speech input. 

- Instead of using carefully curated paired speech-text data, they use a "modal invariance" approach with unpaired automatic speech recognition (ASR) data. The idea is that the LLM's response should be the same whether the input prompt is text or audio with the same semantic content.

- This allows the model to take speech input and leverage all the original text-based capabilities of the LLM (question answering, translation, reasoning, etc) in an end-to-end manner, without needing to cascade speech recognition. 

- It can sustain dialogues, leveraging context to help understand speech, unlike cascaded ASR+LLM systems.

- The model has cross-modal abilities like speech-to-text translation and audio summarization.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a method to extend LLMs to handle speech in an end-to-end and general way, without compromising their original text capabilities or needing curated paired data. This greatly expands the ways users can interact with and prompt the LLM.
