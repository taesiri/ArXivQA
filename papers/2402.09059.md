# [I can't see it but I can Fine-tune it: On Encrypted Fine-tuning of   Transformers using Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Handling sensitive data on machine learning as a service (MLaaS) platforms necessitates adherence to privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. Sharing sensitive personal data externally for model development enables potential breaches and unauthorized access. Existing privacy-preserving machine learning approaches using secure multiparty computation or fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) have focused more on private inference rather than private training.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes BlindTuner, an optimized system for privacy-preserving fine-tuning of transformer models using FHE-encrypted data in a cloud environment. It enables training on encrypted data without requiring decryption. The system operates between a client (data owner) and a cloud (for ML computations).

Key Highlights:
- Client extracts features from images using a shared pre-trained DEiT model, encrypts them using FHE, and sends them to cloud for fine-tuning.
- Cloud fine-tunes ML model on encrypted data using proposed techniques like Nesterov's accelerated gradient and encrypted matrix multiplication. 
- Detailed experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, DermaMNIST and face mask detection datasets show BlindTuner achieves comparable accuracy to non-encrypted models.
- BlindTuner exhibits superior performance than prior arts like Glyph and HETAL, improving speed by 1.5x to 600x while achieving better or equal accuracy.
- Security analysis shows BlindTuner preserves privacy by operating only on encrypted data.

Main Contributions:
- Optimized system BlindTuner that enables privacy-preserving fine-tuning of transformers using FHE encryption.
- Methodology to balance tradeoffs between FHE schemes and data-efficient image transformers. 
- Extensive evaluation validating accuracy and improved computational performance over state-of-the-art.
- Open-source implementation that provides accessibility without needing specialized cryptography knowledge.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing privacy-preserving training of machine learning models, with a focus on image classification tasks using transformers. The proposed BlindTuner system demonstrates strong potential.
