# [Exploiting Symmetry in Dynamics for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning   with Asymmetric Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19024)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent work in reinforcement learning (RL) has leveraged symmetries in the dynamics model to improve sample efficiency in training policies. However, most methods assume that both the dynamics and the reward function exhibit the same symmetries. This is a limiting assumption, as in many real-world environments, the dynamics may have inherent symmetries while the rewards do not follow those same symmetries. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper investigates scenarios where only the dynamics exhibit symmetry, widening the scope of problems where symmetry techniques can be applied in RL and control. The authors use Cartan's moving frame method to introduce a technique for learning dynamical models that, by construction, satisfy specified symmetry properties. 

Main Contributions:

- Focuses on symmetries in dynamics independent of reward function symmetries, extending applicability of symmetry techniques

- Leverages Cartan's moving frame method to relate a symmetrical dynamics model to a function operating on a reduced input space

- Proposes a method to learn a neural network dynamical model that satisfies desired symmetries by construction

- Demonstrates through experiments on two environments that the proposed technique learns more accurate models compared to baseline

- Highlights benefits especially when model sizes are small, as symmetry acts as an inductive bias

In summary, the paper expands the scope of problems in RL and control where symmetry can help by not requiring symmetry in rewards. It uses Cartan's frames to exploit symmetries inherent only in dynamics and shows improved model learning. Symmetry acts as an inductive bias, improving accuracy, especially for smaller model sizes.
