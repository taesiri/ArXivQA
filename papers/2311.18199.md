# [Hy-Tracker: A Novel Framework for Enhancing Efficiency and Accuracy of   Object Tracking in Hyperspectral Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18199)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Hy-Tracker, a novel framework for object tracking in hyperspectral videos that leverages the detection capabilities of YOLOv7. A key innovation is the integration of a refined tracking module on top of YOLOv7 to address challenges like occlusions, background clutter, and fast motion. The tracker refines YOLOv7's detections for improved tracking accuracy. Furthermore, a Kalman filter is incorporated to handle scale variations and occlusions. The Background Aware Band Selection module selects the most discriminative bands to produce pseudo-color images as input to YOLOv7. Experiments on hyperspectral benchmark datasets demonstrate Hy-Tracker's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The ablation studies validate the contributions of the key components. By bridging object detection and hyperspectral tracking, leveraging spatial-spectral information, and refining detections, Hy-Tracker pushes the boundaries of tracking accuracy and robustness across diverse real-world scenarios.
