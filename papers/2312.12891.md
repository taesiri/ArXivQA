# [MinePlanner: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Planning in Large Minecraft   Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Classical planners require abstract task representations as input, which are carefully designed by humans to only include necessary information. This limits their ability to scale to real-world tasks with irrelevant details. 
- Existing planning benchmarks either artificially increase the number of objects in classical domains like Blocksworld or combine multiple planning problems. They fail to capture the true complexity of real-world tasks.
- There is an opportunity to bridge planning research with reinforcement learning by using Minecraft as a testbed. However, existing Minecraft benchmarks focus on control and perception, not planning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents MinePlanner, a framework to automatically generate planning tasks and representations in Minecraft worlds. 
- It allows creating tasks by specifying initial block placements, agent inventory, and goals in YAML format. The framework handles extracting world state and converting it to PDDL.
- Both propositional and numeric planning variants are supported. Location is represented using fluents in numeric planning and predicate integers in propositional planning.
- The framework also supports verifying and visualizing plans by executing them in-game.

Key Contributions:
- A set of 45 Minecraft planning tasks across 3 difficulty levels requiring long horizon planning (easy contains only essential objects, hard contains thousands of irrelevant blocks).
- A general framework to specify new Minecraft planning tasks and automatically compile them to PDDL.
- An analysis of state-of-the-art planners, identifying challenges in scaling to tasks with thousands of objects. For instance, most planners failed to even translate or ground the tasks.
- The benchmark and framework bridge planning research with existing Minecraft reinforcement learning benchmarks.
- Results demonstrate key areas for improving planning scalability like operating on lifted representations and leveraging parallelism.

In summary, the paper presents a novel planning benchmark based in Minecraft that surfaces new challenges in scaling planning to real-world tasks with irrelevant details and large state spaces. The framework and analysis provide a foundation for advancing planning algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new benchmark for long-horizon planning tasks based on Minecraft worlds containing thousands of objects, tests state-of-the-art planners on tasks within this benchmark, and shows that current planners struggle to scale effectively to these large, object-dense environments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MinePlanner, a new benchmark for long-horizon planning tasks based on Minecraft. Specifically, the paper:

- Presents a framework called MinePlanner that can automatically generate Minecraft planning tasks and their PDDL representations, supporting both propositional and numeric planning. 

- Provides a benchmark suite of 45 Minecraft planning tasks across 3 difficulty levels, involving goals like building structures, gathering resources, and navigation.

- Benchmarks state-of-the-art planners like Fast Downward and ENHSP-20 on these tasks, demonstrating that they struggle with many of the challenges like scaling to thousands of objects.

- Identifies areas for improvement to develop planners that can operate effectively in complex real-world domains with many irrelevant objects, serving as a bridge between learning and planning.

In summary, the key contribution is the new MinePlanner benchmark for evaluating long-horizon planning in large Minecraft worlds to spur progress in planning algorithms that can scale and deal with noise.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new benchmark for long-horizon planning tasks based on Minecraft worlds. What are some of the key desirable characteristics of Minecraft that make it a useful testbed environment for planning research compared to other options?

2. The paper uses a YAML specification to define tasks in Minecraft worlds. What are some of the advantages of this structured representation compared to manually specifying tasks? How extensible is this format to creating new types of tasks?

3. The paper supports both propositional and numeric planning representations. What are some of the key differences in how object locations and inventories are represented between these two formalisms? What are some pros and cons of each approach in this domain? 

4. The paper makes some simplifications to the actual Minecraft mechanics like removing gravity and simplifying movement. How could some of these restrictions be relaxed while still allowing tractable planning? What new modeling challenges might that introduce?

5. The benchmark contains 45 planning tasks categorized into 3 difficulty levels. What key properties distinguish the "easy", "medium", and "hard" versions of tasks? Are there additional challenge levels that could be explored?

6. The movement and interaction operators are defined with pick up actions interleaved into standard movement. What issues could arise if pick up was defined as a separate standalone action?

7. Goals are defined using a special checkgoal action. What are some limitations of this approach compared to more native PDDL goal representations? Could there be issues correctly modeling goal reachability?

8. The benchmark revealed state-of-the-art planners struggling with many Minecraft planning tasks. What key challenges posed in these domains are planners failing to address currently? 

9. The paper identified leveraging modern compute clusters and developing lifted planning algorithms as two ways planners can scale up. What are some other promising research directions for handling large planning domains efficiently?

10. The framework supports automatic verification of plans produced by planners. What additional instrumentation could be added to provide more detailed diagnostics pinpointing exactly where and how a plan failed?
