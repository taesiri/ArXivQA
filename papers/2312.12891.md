# [MinePlanner: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Planning in Large Minecraft   Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12891)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Classical planners require abstract task representations as input, which are carefully designed by humans to only include necessary information. This limits their ability to scale to real-world tasks with irrelevant details. 
- Existing planning benchmarks either artificially increase the number of objects in classical domains like Blocksworld or combine multiple planning problems. They fail to capture the true complexity of real-world tasks.
- There is an opportunity to bridge planning research with reinforcement learning by using Minecraft as a testbed. However, existing Minecraft benchmarks focus on control and perception, not planning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents MinePlanner, a framework to automatically generate planning tasks and representations in Minecraft worlds. 
- It allows creating tasks by specifying initial block placements, agent inventory, and goals in YAML format. The framework handles extracting world state and converting it to PDDL.
- Both propositional and numeric planning variants are supported. Location is represented using fluents in numeric planning and predicate integers in propositional planning.
- The framework also supports verifying and visualizing plans by executing them in-game.

Key Contributions:
- A set of 45 Minecraft planning tasks across 3 difficulty levels requiring long horizon planning (easy contains only essential objects, hard contains thousands of irrelevant blocks).
- A general framework to specify new Minecraft planning tasks and automatically compile them to PDDL.
- An analysis of state-of-the-art planners, identifying challenges in scaling to tasks with thousands of objects. For instance, most planners failed to even translate or ground the tasks.
- The benchmark and framework bridge planning research with existing Minecraft reinforcement learning benchmarks.
- Results demonstrate key areas for improving planning scalability like operating on lifted representations and leveraging parallelism.

In summary, the paper presents a novel planning benchmark based in Minecraft that surfaces new challenges in scaling planning to real-world tasks with irrelevant details and large state spaces. The framework and analysis provide a foundation for advancing planning algorithms.
