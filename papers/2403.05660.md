# [Decoupling Degradations with Recurrent Network for Video Restoration in   Under-Display Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05660)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Under-display cameras (UDCs) are becoming popular in full-screen mobile devices, but suffer from image degradation due to light diffraction through the display pixels. This is even more challenging for video restoration.
- Existing methods either treat all degradations equally or are designed for UDC image restoration, failing to utilize temporal information effectively for video restoration.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a video restoration network called D^2RNet that decouples different degradations in UDC video and handles them separately.

- It employs Decoupling Attention Modules (DAMs) that generate flare and haze masks to separate brighter flare regions with content loss from darker hazy regions.

- Flare removal uses long-term propagation to recover lost details while haze removal focuses on short-term features for denoising. 

- Multi-scale feature learning and bi-directional propagation further enhance video representations over time.

Main Contributions:
- First work to address UDC video restoration by decoupling degradations based on light intensity changes.

- Propose tailored network D^2RNet with recurrent attention modules to eliminate flare and haze separately.

- Introduce large-scale simulated UDC video dataset VidUDC33K for benchmarking.

- Achieve state-of-the-art performance with 1.02dB PSNR gain and clear visual improvements over other methods.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in UDC video restoration by taking a new perspective to handle diffraction degradation changes over time, with both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrating clear advantages. The dataset and perspectives could facilitate future works in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel video restoration network called D^2RNet that effectively decouples and removes the flare and haze degradations in under-display camera videos using tailored components to exploit both long-term and short-term features over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel video restoration network called D^2RNet for under-display camera (UDC) video restoration. This is the first work to address the problem of video degradation in UDC systems. 

2. It introduces a core module called the decoupling attention module (DAM) that effectively separates the flare and haze degradations caused by different incident light intensities in UDC video. The module handles these degradations separately using long-term and short-term feature learning.

3. It establishes a large-scale UDC video dataset called VidUDC33K for benchmarking. This is the first dataset for UDC video restoration.

4. It demonstrates through extensive experiments that D^2RNet outperforms state-of-the-art image and video restoration methods, with over 1dB PSNR improvement on the proposed dataset. The decoupling mechanism offers an effective and targeted solution to eliminating various degradations in UDC video.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first dedicated network D^2RNet for UDC video restoration, which introduces an effective decoupling mechanism to handle flare and haze degradations separately. This is demonstrated through strong quantitative and qualitative results on the first UDC video dataset VidUDC33K.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a soft mask generation function to decouple flare and haze regions. What are the key considerations in designing an effective soft mask generation function for this application? How does the threshold parameter $\tau$ impact performance?

2. The paper utilizes both long-term and short-term features in the recurrent propagation framework. Explain why both are needed and how they complement each other. What are the tradeoffs of using more long-term vs short-term features? 

3. The Decoupling Attention Module (DAM) refines features using intermediate supervision between stages. Analyze the benefits of this approach compared to directly predicting images at each stage. How does it enable more effective feature learning?

4. The paper adopts a multi-scale bilateral recurrent architecture. Explain why this design is well-suited for the UDC video restoration task and analyze how each component (multi-scale, bilateral, recurrent) aids in diffraction removal.

5. The flare and haze removal components leverage different spatial-temporal information. Analyze the differences in how they exploit context and why this asymmetry is sensible based on the distortion characteristics. 

6. Discuss the limitations of existing video restoration methods applied directly to the UDC domain. What unique challenges exist in UDC video compared to other degradation types that warranted a specialized approach?

7. The paper establishes a new large-scale UDC video dataset. Critically evaluate the realism and diversity of degradation in this dataset. What additional data characteristics could further advance research?  

8. Analyze the computational complexity and parameter efficiency of the proposed D^2RNet, especially compared to recent video restoration networks. How could it be optimized further?

9. Discuss how the proposed perspective of decoupling degradations in UDC video could be applied to or inspire solutions for other computational imaging problems plagued by multiple interdependent distortions. 

10. The diffraction kernel (PSF) changes dynamically in UDC video. Propose techniques to achieve more accurate PSF estimation over long video sequences to further improve restoration quality.
