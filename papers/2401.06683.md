# [DQNC2S: DQN-based Cross-stream Crisis event Summarizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of generating crisis event timelines and summaries from multiple streams of social media and news data during a disaster event. 
- Key challenges include: redundancy across data streams, lack of human annotations, needing to handle multiple information queries from emergency responders simultaneously. 
- Existing methods rely on retrieve and reranking which scales poorly and requires redundant data filtering.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a DQN (reinforcement learning) based approach called DQNC2S to select relevant texts from the streams on-the-fly without annotations or reranking.
- It incorporates redundancy filtering into the reward function instead of as a separate stage.  
- Extractive QA is used to provide weak annotation scores to help guide DQN training.  
- Additional stages are added for topic modeling with BERTopic and abstractive summarization with BART-CNN.

Main Contributions:
- Online relevant text retrieval without separate indexing and reranking stages.
- Early redundancy filtering integrated into the DQN reward function.
- Efficient multi-query handling with inference time independent of number of queries.  
- Outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the CrisisFACTS benchmark based on ROUGE and BERTScore.
- Qualitative analysis confirms proper text retrieval behavior and correlation to expected daily facts.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel DQN-based approach to extractive summarization of crisis event timelines that operates directly on multiple text streams and information needs, achieving improved efficiency and relevance compared to prior retrieve and rerank techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Deep Q-Network based approach for online cross-stream crisis timeline generation that retrieves relevant, non-redundant pieces of text to summarize disaster events without needing human annotations or content re-ranking.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. An RL approach for online text retrieval to summarize crisis events. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require indexing the crisis-relevant data for efficient content retrieval. Instead, it retrieves relevant texts on-the-fly from the input streams without any human supervision.

2. Early redundancy filtering incorporated into the RL reward function to reduce the amount of redundant data processed after retrieval. This improves efficiency and reduces the complexity of timeline generation. 

3. Efficient handling of multiple queries simultaneously, allowing efficient generation of timelines for multi-faceted crisis events, where each query refers to a complementary facet of the event.

So in summary, the main contribution is an online RL-based approach for summarizing multi-stream crisis event data that achieves better efficiency, handles query redundancy, and supports multi-query timelines compared to existing methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using Electra and LongFormer for weak annotation to generate query-text pairs. What are the key advantages of using these models over other QA models for this task? How do they complement each other?

2. The paper uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for text retrieval. What modifications were made to the traditional DQN framework to enable it to work for this text retrieval task? How is the action and observation space designed?

3. The reward function has an interesting design with both positive and negative rewards. Walk through an example to illustrate how the different components of the reward function enable the agent to retrieve informative yet non-redundant texts. 

4. The paper experimented with variants using topic modeling (DQNC2S-T) and abstractive summarization (DQNC2S-A). Explain the intuition behind using these and how they help generate better crisis timelines compared to just the basic DQNC2S.

5. Compare and contrast the inference time of the proposed DQN-based approach versus the retrieve and rerank approaches like unicamp and ohmkiz. Why is the DQN method more efficient, especially for multiple queries?

6. Analyze the DQN training curve in Figure 2a. What insights do you gather from the exploration and exploitation phases? How was the maximum number of facts per day determined?

7. The paper shows DQNC2S has higher BERTScore while lower ROUGE scores compared to unicamp for the ICS summaries. Speculate on the possible reasons behind this based on the nature of ICS summaries.

8. What modifications can be made to the DQN framework to handle evolving crisis events spanning multiple days instead of generating separate daily facts? 

9. The paper focuses only on extractive summarization. Propose an extension to integrate abstractive summarization capabilities within the DQN framework.

10. The paper does not use the Facebook data stream due to restrictions. Hypothesize how adding this extra stream might impact the overall approach and results.
