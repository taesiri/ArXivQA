# [ClaimVer: Explainable Claim-Level Verification and Evidence Attribution   of Text Through Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09724)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ClaimVer: Explainable Claim-Level Verification and Evidence Attribution of Text Through Knowledge Graphs":

Problem:
- Widespread misinformation and disinformation is a major issue, exacerbated by the proliferation of AI text generation tools. Fact checking tools lack appropriate explainability or granularity to be useful.
- Most fact checkers provide blanket labels for entire passages, which can be misleading. There is a need for claim-level verification with localized evidence attribution. 
- Prior verification methods have limitations in coverage, relying on one-to-one matches between input and reference texts. Maintaining document indices or vector DBs is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- ClaimVer - A framework for fine-grained claim-level text verification and evidence attribution using knowledge graphs (KGs).
- Leverages entity linking and KG retrieval to collect relevant triplets to verify against.
- Decomposes text into individual claims and operationalizes an objective function using fine-tuned LLMs to generate prediction, rationale and evidence for each claim.
- Produces additional scores for match confidence and overall text validity.
- Aims to be human-centric through detailed annotations to educate users and build trust.

Main Contributions:
- Performs more granular claim-level analysis unlike prior paragraph-level methods. Allows localizing specific inaccuracies.
- Eliminates dependency on one reference text by using KGs built from multiple sources. Enhances coverage. 
- Easy to update and audit unlike document indices or vector DBs. Ensures accuracy.
- Generates explanatory outputs to boost user awareness and trust.
- Flexible framework can adapt to new domains by switching KG.
- Validation scoring method allows applicability to downstream ranking/filtering tasks.

In summary, ClaimVer is an explainable and granular text verification system tailored towards human users by leveraging KGs to provide claim-based analysis and detailed attribution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents ClaimVer, a human-centric text verification and evidence attribution framework that performs fine-grained analysis at the claim level by querying a knowledge graph to generate predictions, match scores, rationales, and attribution scores for each identified claim.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting ClaimVer, a human-centric framework for explainable claim-level verification and evidence attribution of text through knowledge graphs. The key aspects of ClaimVer include:

1) Performing fine-grained text verification and evidence attribution at the claim level rather than whole sentences/paragraphs. This allows for precisely pinpointing specific inaccuracies.

2) Generating explanations, rationale, and evidence to boost user awareness and trust in the automated predictions. 

3) Eliminating one-to-one dependency between input text and reference texts by utilizing a knowledge graph, allowing for more comprehensive evaluation even when information is distributed across multiple sources.

4) Flexibility to adapt to new domains by switching the knowledge graph to a more suitable one.

5) Focus on human-centric design principles like granularity, explainability, and informativeness to make the system more intuitive and user-friendly.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel human-centric framework, ClaimVer, that enables fine-grained, explainable claim-level text validation through knowledge graphs while enhancing user trust and understanding of the system.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using Wikidata as the knowledge graph source. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Wikidata compared to other knowledge graphs? How does the choice of knowledge graph impact coverage, accuracy, and scalability of the proposed method?

2. The paper describes a multi-node breadth-first search algorithm called Woolnet to retrieve relevant triplets from the knowledge graph. Can you explain in more detail how this algorithm works? How does it compare to other approaches for knowledge graph search and triplet retrieval? 

3. The fine-tuning strategy uses adapters with rank 8. What is the motivation behind using adapters compared to regular fine-tuning? Why was rank 8 chosen for the adapters? How does this choice impact model capacity and efficiency?

4. The paper computes a Triplets Match Score (TMS) to quantify the match between claims and retrieved triplets. It uses a weighted combination of semantic similarity and entity overlap ratio. How were the weights α and β chosen? How sensitive is performance to the choice of α and β?

5. The Knowledge Graph Attribution Score (KAS) uses a modified sigmoid to compute a continuous validity score. Why is the standard sigmoid not suitable? Explain the motivation behind using an asymmetric sigmoid that penalizes negative scores more.

6. Error analysis revealed that claim decomposition contributes significantly to lower accuracy scores. What are some ways claim decomposition can be improved? Would a two-step approach help? What are the tradeoffs?  

7. The paper acknowledges knowledge coverage limitations in Wikidata. When coverage is inadequate, how can the framework adapt? Discuss integrating specialized knowledge graphs based on domain.

8. What experiments could be designed to evaluate the real-world efficacy of ClaimVer for users? How can we quantify metrics like trust, ease of use, and informativeness?  

9. The paper focuses on text verification for static articles/passages. How can ClaimVer be extended to real-time conversations with chatbots? What additional challenges need to be addressed?

10. How well does ClaimVer complement other fact checking systems and misinformation detection tools? Could ClaimVer be used to improve systems that provide only blanket, non-granular evaluations?
