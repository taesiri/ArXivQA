## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach called Customized Polytropon (C-Poly) for efficient multi-task learning. C-Poly combines task-common skills shared across tasks and task-specific skills unique to each task using a modular and composable framework. Specifically, it jointly learns an inventory of adapters, implemented as LoRAs, and a routing mechanism that selects a variable subset of adapters to compose the adapter for each task. This allows knowledge sharing across tasks while preserving specialized capacity per task. Additionally, C-Poly incorporates low-rank decomposition techniques to further enhance parameter efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SuperGLUE and Super NI benchmarks, C-Poly is shown to outperform existing PEFT methods including fully-shared, task-specific, and skill-indistinguishable approaches. The results demonstrate C-Poly's ability to significantly improve sample efficiency in multi-task learning scenarios by effectively balancing task-commonality and task-specificity.
