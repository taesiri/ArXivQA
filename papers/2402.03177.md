# [CIDAR: Culturally Relevant Instruction Dataset For Arabic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03177)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing Arabic instruction tuning datasets predominantly cater to English or derive from English-dominated models, resulting in inherent Western cultural biases. This significantly impacts Arabic language models, which have distinct grammar reflecting diverse Arab cultures.  
- Current approaches rely on poor machine translations or LLM-generated responses without human review, leading to distorted and misaligned instructions.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors introduce CIDAR, the first open Arabic instruction tuning dataset that is culturally aligned by human reviewers. 
- CIDAR contains 10,000 instruction-output pairs representing the Arab region. It originated from the English AlpaGasus dataset which was machine translated then manually revised for linguistic, cultural, and regional relevance.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis shows CIDAR mitigates Western biases and improves representation of Arab countries, names, grammar, and themes compared to the machine translated dataset.
- Experiments demonstrate fine-tuning models on CIDAR enhances cultural alignment and Arabic language understanding compared to other datasets.  
- CIDAR bridges the gap between language models and Arabic linguistic/cultural nuances. Its public release facilitates research into aligning models with specific cultures.

In summary, the paper presents CIDAR, the first open and manually localized Arabic instruction tuning dataset that aligns language models with Arabic culture better than translated datasets or LLM-generated responses. It aims to advance Arabic NLP research through culturally-relevant data.
