## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes LivePhoto, a novel framework for animating a real image using text descriptions to control the motion. The key innovation is enabling the text to truly guide the motion in the generated video, overcoming limitations of prior work where text failed to align with motions. The authors first establish a strong baseline that leverages the input image for content guidance through multiple strategies like concatenating a reference latent and employing a content encoder. To address the ambiguity between text and motions, they introduce motion intensity estimation which offers controllable intensity levels. Moreover, a text re-weighting module is designed to emphasize motion-related words in the prompt. Equipped with these technical contributions, LivePhoto demonstrates an impressive capacity to produce videos that keep the identity of the input photo, follow the textual instructions to conjure various motions and effects, and allow easy adjustment of the motion intensity. The experiments substantiate LivePhoto's advantages over existing methods and open-sourced projects across diverse test cases. Limitations relate to resolution and model scale, which have ample room for improvement as future work.
