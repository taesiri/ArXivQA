# [LivePhoto: Real Image Animation with Text-guided Motion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02928)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes LivePhoto, a novel framework for animating a real image using text descriptions to control the motion. The key innovation is enabling the text to truly guide the motion in the generated video, overcoming limitations of prior work where text failed to align with motions. The authors first establish a strong baseline that leverages the input image for content guidance through multiple strategies like concatenating a reference latent and employing a content encoder. To address the ambiguity between text and motions, they introduce motion intensity estimation which offers controllable intensity levels. Moreover, a text re-weighting module is designed to emphasize motion-related words in the prompt. Equipped with these technical contributions, LivePhoto demonstrates an impressive capacity to produce videos that keep the identity of the input photo, follow the textual instructions to conjure various motions and effects, and allow easy adjustment of the motion intensity. The experiments substantiate LivePhoto's advantages over existing methods and open-sourced projects across diverse test cases. Limitations relate to resolution and model scale, which have ample room for improvement as future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LivePhoto, a framework for animating a still image with text-guided motion control by establishing a strong baseline with image content guidance, introducing motion intensity estimation and text re-weighting modules to better link texts and motions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the LivePhoto system, which is a framework for animating a real image using text descriptions to control the motion. Specifically:

- They establish a strong baseline for animating images by equipping a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) to take a real image as further input. This provides pixel-level and global guidance to preserve the image's identity.

- They propose using motion intensity as an additional condition besides text. This helps resolve ambiguity in mapping text descriptions to motions. Users can adjust intensity to customize motions.

- They introduce a text re-weighting module to emphasize the motion-related parts of text embeddings. This allows the text instructions to better guide the motions while the image controls the content.

- The proposed methods allow LivePhoto to generate videos that follow textual motion instructions like actions and camera movements. It also shows an ability to conjure new content from nothing based on the text.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling better text-to-motion control when animating real images, through motion intensity guidance and text re-weighting. The system demonstrates an impressive capacity for text-guided image animation.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing works on text-to-video generation usually overlook the issue that the text fails to control the motions in the synthesized videos. Towards this challenge, this paper explores the task of animating a real image with textual motion control. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LivePhoto, a framework that takes a real image, a text prompt and a motion intensity level as input to generate a video that animates the image according to the text description. 

The key components of LivePhoto include:

1) A strong baseline that equips a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) to take an image as additional input by concatenating the image latent and employing a content encoder for global guidance.

2) A motion intensity estimation module that parameterizes the motion intensity into different levels, offering a supplementary condition besides text to indicate the motion speed and magnitude. 

3) A text re-weighting module that learns to assign different weights to each token of the text embedding to emphasize the motion-related parts. This allows the text to provide better guidance for motions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel framework LivePhoto for animating real images with textual motion control, which is useful for various applications.

- Introduces motion intensity guidance and text re-weighting techniques to better align the text instructions with the video motions.

- Achieves strong performance in animating images from diverse domains according to textual descriptions of actions, camera movements or even conjuring new content.

- Enables convenient customization of the motion intensity during inference thanks to the parameterized intensity levels.

In summary, LivePhoto explores an underexplored but useful direction to animate real images with fine-grained textual motion control. The motion intensity guidance and text re-weighting are simple yet effective designs that prove crucial for this challenging task.
