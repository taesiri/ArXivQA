# [FORCE: Dataset and Method for Intuitive Physics Guided Human-object   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Synthesizing realistic human-object interactions is challenging as existing methods overlook crucial physical attributes like object weight, friction, and human force. This results in motions that lack diversity and nuanced details that are essential for realism. Additionally, no dataset exists that captures nuanced interactions under varying physical conditions to enable research in this direction.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes FORCE, the first kinematic model to synthesize diverse, nuanced human-object interactions by modeling physical attributes. The key insight is that human motion is dictated by the interplay between the human force exerted and the object's resistance. FORCE introduces an intuitive physics encoding to represent this crucial relation. Conditioning on this encoding enables disambiguating similar poses and learning from multi-class motions. FORCE also predicts contacts conditioned on resistance to ensure physical plausibility.

The paper also contributes a dataset of 450 motions of pushing, pulling and carrying objects with varying resistance levels. It uses a customized hybrid tracker with 4 RGB-D cameras and 17 IMUs to accurately capture the interactions. The dataset can serve as a benchmark for human-object interaction tasks.

Main Contributions:

1) FORCE model to synthesize nuanced interactions using a novel intuitive physics encoding of human force and object resistance

2) Dataset with accurate capture of interactions under varying physical conditions to stimulate research 

3) State-of-the-art performance in diversity and realism of synthesized motions

4) Interactive control over resistance and contact modes at test time to manipulate style

The model, code, and dataset are publicly released to further research in modeling physical attributes for human-object interactions.
