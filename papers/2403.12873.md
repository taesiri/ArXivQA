# [Short-Term Solar Irradiance Forecasting Under Data Transmission   Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12873)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Accurate near-term forecasting of solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation will be critical for grid stability as renewable penetration increases. 
- Short-term PV forecasts rely on large volumes of high-dimensional data including meteorological measurements, numerical weather predictions, and satellite images. 
- Sky cameras are an increasingly common method to gather site-specific data, but transmitting the images from remote PV sites to centralized computing facilities for processing can be difficult due to limited communication bandwidth.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a data-parsimonious machine learning model to forecast solar irradiance using only scalar features extracted from sky camera images, rather than full images. This minimizes transmission bandwidth requirements.
- The model uses a CNN-LSTM architecture with a novel addition - a noise input to account for unmeasured disturbances. Output is the residual between measured irradiance and a persistence of cloudiness (POC) baseline forecast.
- Model training occurs over multiple stages using a rolling train-validate approach to determine optimal data representations, input sequence lengths, and most impactful features.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates a parsimonious model for solar forecasting needing much less transmission bandwidth than existing methods.
- Shows that forecasting the deviation from POC improves accuracy by eliminating the need to model known long-term dynamics.  
- Introduces a noise model to account for unmeasured variables, improving accuracy even with fewer features.
- Provides new insights on feature importance and the effect of input sequence length based on analysis of a large-scale dataset.

The model achieves a mean absolute error of 74.34 W/m^2 compared to 134.35 W/m^2 for POC, using only 8 scalar features extracted from sky camera images as inputs. This is a major reduction in data requirements compared to other image-based forecasting models.
