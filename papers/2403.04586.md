# [Learning Agility Adaptation for Flight in Clutter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04586)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Animals and robots need to balance agility and safety when moving in unknown, cluttered environments. Determining the right level of agility is challenging.
- Existing methods for robotic flight either use a conservatively low constant agility level or require a fully known prior map of the environment. 

Proposed Solution:
- A hierarchical learning framework to adaptively determine agility level for flight in unknown cluttered environments. 
- An "agility policy" is learned with reinforcement learning to output the agility level based on observations.
- The agility level is used by an underlying model-based trajectory planner to generate a trajectory.

Key Contributions:
- Agility policy learned with a two-stage "pre-training-fine-tuning" reward scheme. The first stage uses human domain knowledge for a smooth reward, while the second stage uses a sparse objective collision reward.
- Policy architecture combines CNNs, MLPs, and inputs occupancy maps, vehicle state, tracking error and previous agility level. 
- Benefits shown over constant agility methods and a non-learning method in complex simulation environments in terms of efficiency, safety and intelligent perception-aware behaviors.
- Policy deployed on a real micro drone with depth camera and onboard computing in cluttered environments, showing adaptive agility selection and safe flight.

In summary, the key innovation is a learned policy that adapts agility level to balance speed and safety during flight in complex environments, on top of a model-based trajectory planner. The results demonstrate clear benefits for autonomous flight in the real world.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to learn an agility adaptation policy for safe and efficient flight of drones in unknown, partially observable, and cluttered environments, where the policy configures the agility level of an underlying model-based trajectory planner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hierarchical learning and planning approach for adaptive agile and safe flight in unknown cluttered environments. Specifically:

- They decompose the policy into an outer-loop agility policy that decides the agility level, learned with reinforcement learning, and an inner-loop policy for trajectory generation using an existing model-based planner. This allows exploiting the efficiency and safety guarantees of model-based methods while enabling agility adaptation.

- They employ a two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning reward scheme to overcome sparse rewards and enable efficient learning of the agility policy. The first stage uses human prior knowledge to shape rewards while the second stage directly reflects the objective.

- They demonstrate the advantages of their approach over constant agility baselines and a non-learning method in simulation. The learned policy exhibits intelligent perception-aware behaviors and can be directly deployed to real-world flight in complex natural clutter.

In summary, the key contribution is an integrated learning and planning framework to achieve adaptive agile and safe flight by combining the strengths of learning and model-based methods. The hierarchical policy structure and two-stage learning process enable this.

The paper proposes a hierarchical learning and planning framework to enable agility adaptation for safe flight of autonomous vehicles in unknown, partially observable, and cluttered environments. It employs model-free reinforcement learning to learn an "agility policy" that decides the agility level, on top of a model-based trajectory optimization backbone. Key aspects include dealing with sparse rewards, using a pre-training-fine-tuning reward scheme, and demonstrating intelligent perception-aware behaviors. The overall approach is validated in simulations and on a real drone in complex cluttered environments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes a hierarchical learning framework that combines a learned "agility policy" module with a model-based trajectory planner. What are the key advantages of this decomposition compared to end-to-end learning of the full policy? How does it balance performance, safety, and sample efficiency?

2) The agility policy module is trained using a two-stage "pre-training-fine-tuning" approach. What is the motivation behind this strategy? Why is the human knowledge-based reward used in pre-training insufficient on its own? 

3) The paper argues that directly using sparse collision rewards to train the agility policy would be difficult and inefficient. What specifically makes this challenging? How do the proposed dense, human knowledge-based rewards in pre-training help mitigate this?

4) Perception awareness is highlighted as a key capability enabled by the learned agility policy. What specific aspects of the method (network architecture, observation space etc.) facilitate the emergence of such behaviors? How are they superior to alternative approaches?

5) Could the proposed framework be applied to other mobile robot platforms beyond quadrotors? What modifications would be required to deploy it on ground vehicles, legged robots etc.?

6) The trajectory planner backbone uses a velocity limit constraint to enforce agility boundaries. Could other constraints like acceleration limits be adapted in a similar way? Would it require changes to the learning approach?

7) What safety considerations need to be kept in mind when deploying such adaptive agility policies on real-world systems? How can they be evaluated systematically before deployment?

8) How sensitive is the performance of the learned policy to variations in the test environments compared to training? Could sim2real transfer issues potentially degrade its effectiveness?

9) The method relies extensively on depth sensing for perception. How robust would the approach be to other imperfections in perception like occlusion or noise? 

10) What future work could build on this approach to achieve fully autonomous navigation without a pre-specified goal? Would hierarchical decomposition still be suitable in that setting?
