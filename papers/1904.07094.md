# [CEDR: Contextualized Embeddings for Document Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07094)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether contextualized language models like ELMo and BERT can be effectively incorporated into existing neural ranking architectures to improve ad-hoc document ranking performance. 

The key hypothesis appears to be that the additional context provided by pretrained contextualized language models will allow existing neural ranking models to better distinguish different meanings/senses of words and lead to improved ranking. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:

- Using multiple similarity matrices based on each layer of a contextualized language model as input to existing neural rankers will allow them to leverage contextual information and improve performance.

- Combining BERT's classification vector with existing neural rankers will further improve ranking performance by benefiting from BERT's semantic capabilities in addition to the rankers' matching mechanisms.

So in summary, the main research question is whether and how contextualized language models can be used to enhance existing neural ranking models for ad-hoc document ranking. The key hypothesis is that the contextual representations will help with word sense disambiguation and lead to better ranking when incorporated into current neural architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Showing that contextualized word representations from pretrained language models like ELMo and BERT can be incorporated into existing neural ranking architectures like PACRR, KNRM, and DRMM. This allows these architectures to leverage the additional context provided by the language models to improve ranking performance.

- Proposing a new joint approach called CEDR that combines BERT's classification vector with existing neural ranking architectures using BERT's token vectors. This allows getting benefits from both BERT's semantic understanding and traditional term matching.

- Demonstrating an approach to address the computational expense of using contextualized language models by only partially computing the representations.

- Achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Robust 2004 and WebTrack 2012-2014 datasets using the proposed CEDR models.

In summary, the main contribution is showing that contextualized language models can be effectively incorporated into neural ranking architectures in different ways to improve ranking performance, while also addressing computational challenges. The CEDR models leveraging BERT represent the main novel method proposed.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in information retrieval and document ranking:

- It builds on recent work in neural ranking architectures like PACRR, KNRM, and DRMM by exploring how to best incorporate contextualized word embeddings from ELMo and BERT. Much prior work has focused on designing new neural ranking architectures but less on representation.

- It shows that fine-tuning BERT on ranking data and using it as input to existing neural rankers improves their performance. This is one of the first papers to do fine-tuning of BERT for ad-hoc ranking.

- The proposed CEDR model jointly combines BERT's classification vector with other neural rankers. This is a novel way to combine BERT's strengths with traditional term matching signals.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates on standard TREC test collections. Many recent neural ranking papers only evaluate on proprietary or limited data.

- It addresses computational challenges of using contextual embeddings, like BERT's max input size and slow runtime. Many papers ignore these practical issues.

- The gains from ELMo and BERT representations are consistent across different neural ranking architectures. This helps demonstrate the value of contextualized embeddings broadly.

- The improvements are fairly sizable over tuned BM25 baselines. Contextualized representations seem to provide meaningful gains over straightforward term matching.

Overall, this paper makes solid contributions in a hot area (contextualized representations) by doing rigorous experiments on standard test collections with multiple neural ranking architectures. The gains over tuned baselines are noteworthy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other contextualized language models besides ELMo and BERT, such as XLNet, RoBERTa, etc. The authors only experimented with ELMo and BERT in this work.

- Investigating whether contextualized language models can help for other IR tasks besides ad-hoc retrieval, such as passage retrieval, query expansion, etc. The current work focused on ad-hoc document ranking.

- Trying different fusion approaches for combining the contextual language model representations with existing neural ranking models. The authors mainly concatenated the BERT classification vector, but other options like attention mechanisms could be explored.

- Improving runtime performance of using contextualized language models, beyond just limiting the number of layers. Things like quantization, distillation, efficient implementations on GPUs/TPUs could help.

- Evaluating on a broader range of test collections beyond just Robust04 and WebTrack. Testing on more diverse datasets could reveal strengths/weaknesses.

- Analyzing the results more deeply, e.g. by comparing effectiveness on different query types, doing failure analysis, etc. This could provide more insight into when contextualized representations help.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring other contextualized language models, applying to other IR tasks, trying new fusion approaches, improving runtime efficiency, broader evaluation, and deeper analysis of results.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper investigates how pretrained contextualized language models like ELMo and BERT can be utilized to improve existing neural ranking architectures for ad-hoc document ranking. The main method proposed is to incorporate the contextualized word embeddings from these language models into the similarity matrix input of neural rankers. Specifically, the similarity matrix is expanded from 2D to 3D, with the third dimension representing the layers of the contextualized model. This allows the ranker to learn which levels of abstraction are most useful for ranking. The paper shows this approach is effective when incorporated into existing neural rankers like PACRR, KNRM, and DRMM. The paper also proposes a joint CEDR model that combines the classification vector from BERT with these expanded input representations to further improve performance. Experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines on the Robust04 and WebTrack benchmarks using these techniques.
