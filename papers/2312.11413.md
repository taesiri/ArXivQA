# [DeRDaVa: Deletion-Robust Data Valuation for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With rising data privacy regulations, data owners can request deletion of their data from machine learning models. This raises two key issues that existing data valuation techniques do not address:
(1) After deletions occur, the existing data valuation scores may no longer be fair as they were computed without accounting for deletions. 
(2) Expensively recomputing the scores after every deletion is computationally infeasible and causes uncertainty/fluctuations in valuation.

Proposed Solution - DeRDaVa:
The paper proposes a new data valuation technique called Deletion-Robust Data Valuation (DeRDaVa) that proactively accounts for anticipated future data deletions when valuating data sources. 

Key ideas:
- Model the collaborative machine learning scenario as a "random cooperative game", where the set of participating data sources is random due to deletions.
- Define new "deletion-robustified" fairness axioms for data valuation in this setting.
- Construct a sequence of valuation functions for different numbers of remaining data sources using "null-player-out" consistency.   
- Derive DeRDaVa as the expectation of marginal contribution over different possible remaining data source sets, adjusted by their probability of occurring.
- Efficiently approximate DeRDaVa using Monte-Carlo sampling or a new 012-MCMC algorithm.
- Generalize DeRDaVa as Risk-DeRDaVa to address model owners with different risk attitudes.

Main Contributions:
- Identified the problem of unfairness in data valuation due to deletions.
- Proposed the first deletion-robust data valuation technique DeRDaVa, proved its fairness and uniqueness properties.
- Developed an efficient 012-MCMC algorithm to approximate DeRDaVa.  
- Demonstrated DeRDaVa reflects data sources' long-term contributions to performance and deletion-robustness better than alternatives like Scaled Shapley.
- Generalized DeRDaVa to Risk-DeRDaVa to handle varying model owner risk attitudes.

The paper makes significant steps towards enabling collaborative machine learning systems to comply with data privacy regulations in a practical manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new data valuation technique called DeRDaVa that anticipates future data deletions and assigns higher pre-deletion scores to data sources that contribute more to preserving model performance robustly against deletions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new data valuation framework called Deletion-Robust Data Valuation (DeRDaVa). Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:

1) DeRDaVa anticipates and accounts for future data deletions when performing data valuation. It assigns higher scores to data sources that are more likely to stay in the collaboration and thus contribute more to preserving model performance after anticipated deletions (deletion-robustness).

2) DeRDaVa satisfies a set of deletion-robustified fairness axioms that extend traditional axioms for data valuation to account for data deletions. This provides a principled and fair approach to data valuation. 

3) An efficient approximation algorithm called 012-MCMC is proposed to estimate DeRDaVa scores which only requires sub-exponential number of marginal contribution queries instead of exponential.

4) DeRDaVa is generalized to Risk-DeRDaVa to account for model owners with different risk preferences towards the worst-case or best-case model utility after deletions.

5) Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the practicality of DeRDaVa and verify that it appropriately accounts for data deletions through various analyses.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel data valuation framework DeRDaVa that specifically addresses the impact of data deletions on existing valuation techniques. Both theoretical properties and practical usefulness of DeRDaVa are analyzed.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Data valuation - Determining the value or contribution of different data sources to train a machine learning model. Used to compensate data sources fairly or identify useful/useless data.

- Semivalues - Concepts from cooperative game theory used in many data valuation techniques to assign fair valuation scores. Examples include Data Shapley, Beta Shapley, etc. 

- Data deletion - Removing data sources and their impact from trained machine learning models, often needed to comply with regulations on data privacy.

- Machine unlearning - Methods to efficiently remove the impact of deleted data from trained models.

- Deletion-robust data valuation (DeRDaVa) - The proposed data valuation framework that anticipates and accounts for future data deletions when valuating data sources. Assigns higher scores to data likely to stay.

- Risk-DeRDaVa - Extension of DeRDaVa for risk-averse or risk-seeking model owners concerned with worst-case or best-case model utility after deletions.  

- Efficient approximation - Use of Monte Carlo sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to efficiently estimate DeRDaVa scores.

- Fairness axioms - Set of mathematical axioms that data valuation techniques should satisfy to ensure fairness, including linearity, dummy player, interchangeability, and monotonicity properties.

The key focus is on developing a data valuation approach that is robust and fair even when data sources may be deleted in the future.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new framework called DeRDaVa for data valuation. What is the key intuition and motivation behind this new framework compared to existing data valuation techniques? 

2. One of the key components in DeRDaVa is modeling the collaborative machine learning scenario as a "random cooperative game". What does this terminology mean and why is it an appropriate abstraction for the problem?

3. The paper introduces several new robustified fairness axioms for data valuation, including Robust Linearity, Robust Dummy Player, Robust Interchangeability and Robust Monotonicity. Can you explain the intuition behind each of these axioms and why they are suitable for settings with potential data deletion? 

4. A core theoretical result in the paper is that DeRDaVa uniquely satisfies the proposed robustified fairness axioms. Can you walk through the key ideas in the uniqueness proof and discuss why this is an important theoretical guarantee?  

5. The paper defines a sequence of semivalues derived through a "NPO-extension" process. What is the intuition behind NPO-extension and how does it help address valuation in the face of changing coalition sizes due to deletions?

6. Two approximation algorithms are proposed for efficient computation of DeRDaVa - Monte Carlo sampling and 012-MCMC. Can you compare and contrast these two algorithms in terms of their applicability, strengths and weaknesses? 

7. The paper generalizes DeRDaVa to Risk-DeRDaVa to account for risk attitudes of model owners. Explain the difference between risk-neutral, risk-averse and risk-seeking attitudes in this context. How does Risk-DeRDaVa operationalize these notions?

8. What empirical evidence does the paper provide to demonstrate the utility of DeRDaVa? Can you summarize some of the key experimental validations? 

9. One could think of a simpler alternative to DeRDaVa - just scaling the semivalue scores by staying probabilities. What are some of the key limitations of this simpler baseline that DeRDaVa is able to overcome?

10. What are some real-world implementation challenges and societal concerns related to the deployment of DeRDaVa? How might the authors' suggestions to address these be strengthened further?
