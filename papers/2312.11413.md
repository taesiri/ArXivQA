# [DeRDaVa: Deletion-Robust Data Valuation for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
With rising data privacy regulations, data owners can request deletion of their data from machine learning models. This raises two key issues that existing data valuation techniques do not address:
(1) After deletions occur, the existing data valuation scores may no longer be fair as they were computed without accounting for deletions. 
(2) Expensively recomputing the scores after every deletion is computationally infeasible and causes uncertainty/fluctuations in valuation.

Proposed Solution - DeRDaVa:
The paper proposes a new data valuation technique called Deletion-Robust Data Valuation (DeRDaVa) that proactively accounts for anticipated future data deletions when valuating data sources. 

Key ideas:
- Model the collaborative machine learning scenario as a "random cooperative game", where the set of participating data sources is random due to deletions.
- Define new "deletion-robustified" fairness axioms for data valuation in this setting.
- Construct a sequence of valuation functions for different numbers of remaining data sources using "null-player-out" consistency.   
- Derive DeRDaVa as the expectation of marginal contribution over different possible remaining data source sets, adjusted by their probability of occurring.
- Efficiently approximate DeRDaVa using Monte-Carlo sampling or a new 012-MCMC algorithm.
- Generalize DeRDaVa as Risk-DeRDaVa to address model owners with different risk attitudes.

Main Contributions:
- Identified the problem of unfairness in data valuation due to deletions.
- Proposed the first deletion-robust data valuation technique DeRDaVa, proved its fairness and uniqueness properties.
- Developed an efficient 012-MCMC algorithm to approximate DeRDaVa.  
- Demonstrated DeRDaVa reflects data sources' long-term contributions to performance and deletion-robustness better than alternatives like Scaled Shapley.
- Generalized DeRDaVa to Risk-DeRDaVa to handle varying model owner risk attitudes.

The paper makes significant steps towards enabling collaborative machine learning systems to comply with data privacy regulations in a practical manner.
