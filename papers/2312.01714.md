# [Retrieval-augmented Multi-modal Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning for Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01714)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for improving multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically retrieving relevant demonstration examples based on cross-modal similarities. Specifically, the authors leverage both intra-modality similarities within the textual or visual modalities, and cross-modality similarities connecting the text and images. Additionally, stratified sampling is introduced to enhance the diversity of retrieved examples. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the ScienceQA dataset demonstrate superior performance, with the ChatGPT-based and GPT-4-based variants achieving 82.67% and 87.43% accuracy respectively. Further analyses reveal consistent improvements across different question types compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like Chameleon. Moreover, the results underscore the effectiveness of combining retrieval mechanisms with CoT prompting for LLMs. The authors also present an insightful evaluation of the recently released GPT-4V model, showing substantially improved zero-shot reasoning abilities compared to the text-only GPT-4. Overall, this work makes notable contributions in advancing multi-modal CoT reasoning through an innovative retrieval-based approach tailored for LLMs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of selecting optimal demonstration examples to guide multi-modal reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Multi-modal reasoning, such as in multi-modal question answering, is complex as it requires understanding connections across both visual (images) and textual data. However, identifying the most informative multi-modal examples as demonstrations for LLMs is difficult. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel method that utilizes retrieval mechanisms to automatically select relevant demonstration examples for multi-modal reasoning. The key idea is to extract cross-modal similarities between the textual and visual parts of examples. This allows retrieving examples that can enhance the reasoning process by providing more pertinent demonstrations to the LLM. Additionally, the method uses stratified sampling to select diverse examples from different categories, further improving demonstration quality.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a new technique to automatically retrieve multi-modal demonstration examples for guiding LLM reasoning based on cross-modal similarity computation.
- Employs stratified sampling method to promote diversity of selected examples. 
- Comprehensive experiments on ScienceQA dataset establish new SOTA, significantly outperforming prior systems like Chameleon.
- Detailed analyses provided regarding different retrieval techniques and number of demonstration examples.
- Case studies demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach in selecting informative examples to activate LLM reasoning.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing multi-modal reasoning for LLMs through innovative retrieval mechanisms for selecting demonstration examples. Both the methodology and empirical results showcase the potential of this technique.
