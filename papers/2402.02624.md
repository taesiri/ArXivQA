# [A Safe Reinforcement Learning driven Weights-varying Model Predictive   Control for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02624)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Determining optimal cost function parameters (weights) for Model Predictive Control (MPC) is challenging. It requires significant manual effort and expertise. 
- A single set of static weights may not deliver optimal performance when operating conditions change.
- Learning weights from scratch using Reinforcement Learning (RL) could lead to safety risks.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-step automated optimization approach:
   1) Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) to identify a catalog of Pareto optimal weights sets.
   2) A "Safe" RL agent that selects the most suitable weight set from this pre-computed catalog at each time step based on the upcoming control task.

- The MOBO step handles the global safety and optimality.
- The Safe RL step enables online adaptation to changing conditions.
- The RL agent chooses from discrete options where each option maps to a Pareto optimal set. So even an untrained agent ensures safety.

Main Contributions:
- Conceiving a Weights-varying MPC driven by a Safe RL agent that adapts costs weights online from a pre-optimized catalog.
- Safety evidence - even an untrained RL agent achieves Pareto optimal performance.
- Demonstrating closed-loop performance beyond the Pareto front with a trained RL agent.
- Analyzing the context-based decision making of the RL agent.
- Assessing generalization on unseen tracks and impact of continued learning in new environments.

In summary, the key novelty is the Safe RL driven Weights-varying MPC approach that automates finding optimal parameters for an MPC while ensuring safety.
