# [Using AI/ML to Find and Remediate Enterprise Secrets in Code &amp; Document   Sharing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01754)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Preventing accidental leakage of secrets like passwords and API keys in code repositories and document sharing platforms is critical for organizations. 
- Existing regex-based tools generate lots of false positives, increasing toil for developers.  
- Automatically remediating detected secrets by modifying code is an unsolved challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop more accurate AI/ML models to detect secrets in code and document platforms. Reduce false positives compared to regex tools.
- Automatically remediate detected secrets in code using OpenRewrite rules. This replaces secrets with approved secure code patterns.

Key Contributions:
- Introduce new task of not just detecting but also auto-remediating secrets in code and documents.
- Develop baseline ML models for detecting secrets in code and Confluence docs. Reduce false positives substantially over regex tools.  
- Show how OpenRewrite rules can automatically remediate detected secrets in code by generating compliant code.
- Propose using generative AI to create OpenRewrite recipes more efficiently.
- Present detailed experiments on real-world datasets from code bases and Confluence. Demonstrate improved detection over regex tools.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel end-to-end pipeline for detecting and auto-fixing accidental secrets in code and documents using AI/ML. It provides baseline models and analysis on real enterprise datasets as a starting point to motivate further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces baseline AI models for detecting secrets in code and document sharing platforms, as well as an approach for automatically remediating detected secrets in code using OpenRewrite rules.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) Introducing the task of using AI/ML models to accurately detect secrets (like passwords, API keys, etc.) in both source code and document sharing platforms like Confluence. This is framed as a challenging and mostly unaddressed problem.

2) Proposing baseline AI/ML models for secrets detection in code and natural language text, and describing their implementation. For code, a logistic regression model is used with features like the secret itself, the file extension, and entropy of the string. For Confluence documents, an XGBoost model is used with TF-IDF vectorized text.

3) Demonstrating the use of OpenRewrite rules to automatically remediate/remove detected secrets in source code and make it compliant. This is presented as an effective solution for auto-remediation.

4) Showing improved performance over existing heuristic-based tools like Yelp detect-secrets in terms of precision and recall for secrets detection. This reduces noise and false positives compared to regex-based approaches.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing and formalizing the task, providing baseline AI models for detection, demonstrating auto-remediation, and showing improved detection performance over existing methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using regular expressions and heuristics for secrets detection can be noisy and produce false positives. Can you elaborate more on the issues with using regular expressions and heuristics for this task? What are some examples of false positives that may occur?

2. The paper proposes a machine learning model for detecting secrets in code. Can you explain in more detail the features used for the model? Why were those specific features chosen? How does the choice of features impact model performance?  

3. For detecting secrets in confluence, the paper uses weak labels from a heuristics-based tool which are then relabeled by SMEs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using this semi-supervised approach compared to a fully manually labeled dataset?

4. The paper shows improved performance over the baseline Yelp Detect-Secrets tool. What metrics were used to evaluate model performance? Why were those metrics chosen as opposed to other common classification evaluation metrics?

5. Can you walk through the machine learning pipeline for the Confluence secrets detection model? What pre-processing and data augmentation techniques were used? Why were those specific techniques chosen?

6. The paper proposes using OpenRewrite for automatically remediating detected secrets in code. What are the challenges in automatically modifying code to remove secrets while maintaining functionality? How does OpenRewrite address those challenges?

7. What types of patterns need to be identified in code to generate effective OpenRewrite recipes for remediating secrets? How can generative AI assist in identifying those patterns and generating recipes? 

8. How was the threshold for predicting a secret tuned in the code secrets detection model? What is the impact of the threshold choice on precision vs recall?

9. What techniques could be used to handle the class imbalance between secrets and non-secrets in the datasets? How does the extreme imbalance impact model performance?

10. The paper suggests large language models could be beneficial for this task. What capabilities of LLMs would be helpful for detecting and automatically remediating secrets? What are some challenges with applying LLMs to this problem?
