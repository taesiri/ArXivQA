# [LIMIT: Less Is More for Instruction Tuning Across Evaluation Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13133)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores how to best finetune and evaluate large language models (LLMs) for general purpose instruction following. The authors finetune open-source MPT-7B and MPT-30B models on instruction datasets of varying sizes, including the 1,000 sample LIMA dataset and larger Instruct datasets with 56-59k examples. They evaluate the finetuned models using two paradigms: (1) traditional NLP benchmarks like MMLU and BIG-bench using MosaicML's Eval Gauntlet, and (2) open-ended generation evaluated by the LLM judge GPT-4. Models exclusively finetuned on LIMA perform well when evaluated by GPT-4 but worse on NLP benchmarks compared to Instruct finetuning. However, combining 1-5k Instruct samples with 1k LIMA samples results in a model that performs well on both evaluation paradigms. This demonstrates that small, high-quality instruction datasets can enable strong capabilities, but evaluation methodology determines which capabilities are measured. Carefully combining datasets captures distinct skills for both perplexity and open-ended assessments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examined the effects of finetuning dataset size and composition on large language model performance across perplexity-based benchmarks and open-ended model evaluations, finding that small, diverse datasets enable effective style alignment while larger domain-specific datasets optimize for benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors finetune open-source models MPT-7B and MPT-30B on instruction datasets of varying sizes and styles, including the LIMA dataset.

2. They evaluate the finetuned models using two separate but widely popular paradigms: (a) the traditional NLP Benchmark approach using MosaicML's Eval Gauntlet, and (b) the model-based evaluation approach with GPT-4 as the judge.

3. They find that when evaluated by GPT-4, models finetuned exclusively on the 1,000 sample LIMA dataset perform the best. However, these models do not perform as well on traditional NLP benchmarks compared to models finetuned on much larger Instruct datasets.

4. They show that finetuning on a small subset of just 1,000-5,000 samples from the Instruct datasets can reach parity with finetuning on the full 56,000 sample datasets. However, these subsets do not perform as well under model-based evaluation.

5. Finally, they show that combining 1,000 LIMA samples with 1,000-5,000 Instruct samples results in good performance under both evaluation paradigms.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that careful construction of small finetuning datasets, combining both open-ended and textbook-style examples, can result in high performance on both traditional NLP benchmarks as well as model-based evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 possible in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does this work explore the balance between quality and quantity of data for finetuning large language models? What implications does this have for the common "bigger is better" approach to model scaling?

2. The paper finds that combining a small subset of Instruct samples with LIMA leads to improved performance on both perplexity-based benchmarks and model-based evaluation. What does this suggest about the strengths and weaknesses of these two evaluation paradigms? 

3. The LIMA dataset was extensively filtered to ensure high quality responses. How might automated data filtering techniques be improved or optimized based on the insights from this study?

4. Both LIMA and Instruct style datasets conferred distinct capabilities on finetuned models. What are some potential ways one could more precisely characterize or define those capabilities?

5. How do the results on model-based evaluation change when using models other than GPT-4 as a judge? What biases might be introduced by the choice of judge model?

6. This study focused exclusively on question answering domains. How might the conclusions change for other domains like summarization, translation, etc?

7. Finetuning on just 1-5k samples matched performance of models finetuned on much larger datasets. Does this provide evidence for the "lottery ticket hypothesis" when it comes to model finetuning?  

8. If creating a high-quality 1k dataset proves sufficient, how might that change incentives and priorities around dataset construction?

9. The study uses open-source models unlike related work focused on closed-source models like GPT-3. What are the tradeoffs introduced by this choice, in terms of reproducibility and generalizability?  

10. The paper introduces model-based evaluation focused exclusively on ranking responses rather than predicting human scores. What are some ways this evaluation paradigm could be expanded or supplemented?


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Instruction finetuning 
- Style alignment
- Less is more finetuning 
- Evaluation paradigms
- Perplexity-based benchmarks
- Model-based evaluation 
- Open-ended generation
- LIMA dataset
- Instruct dataset
- MosaicML Eval Gauntlet
- GPT-4 judge model

The paper explores finetuning LLMs like MPT-7B and MPT-30B on different sized instruction tuning datasets like LIMA and Instruct. It then evaluates the finetuned models on traditional NLP benchmarks using the MosaicML Eval Gauntlet, as well as open-ended generation capabilities using GPT-4 as a judge model. The key finding is that combining a small subset of examples from Instruct datasets and LIMA can result in good performance across both evaluation paradigms.
