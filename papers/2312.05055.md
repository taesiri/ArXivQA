 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents the design and implementation of an Automatic Assisted Aiming System (AAA-System) for the Robomaster EP robot based on YOLOv5 object detection. The system utilizes YOLOv5 for multi-object detection to identify the robot and its armor, integrated with the DeepSORT algorithm for tracking. To ensure precise aiming, a PID controller with feedforward enhancement and an FIR filter paired with a Kalman filter are used to quickly maneuver the gimbal towards targets and predict their next positions. The system is optimized for small object detection using strided convolutions instead of max pooling in YOLOv5. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced accuracy in detecting and hitting targets. Key innovations include the use of DeepSORT for optimal targeting sequence determination, FIR filters and PID control for noise reduction and rapid responses, and regression analysis to compensate for projectile deviations. Overall, the system significantly improves the robotâ€™s autonomous targeting capability for tactical shooting competitions.
