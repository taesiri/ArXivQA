## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an automatic assisted aiming system for the Robomaster EP robot based on YOLOv5 detection, DeepSORT tracking, Kalman filter prediction, and PID + FIR control of the gimbal to accurately identify and engage multiple targets in robot competitions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of an automatic assisted aiming system for the Robomaster EP robot using YOLOv5 for multi-object detection and tracking. Specifically:

1) They employed YOLOv5 for detecting and recognizing multiple objects like the Robomaster robot and its armor. YOLOv5 was chosen due its accuracy and efficiency for processing high-density image data in tactical battles.

2) They integrated the DeepSORT algorithm with YOLOv5 to enable tracking of identified objects by assigning them unique IDs. This allows tracking even when targets become occluded or camera angles change. 

3) For predicting target trajectories, they used a Kalman filter alongside PID and FIR controllers. This enables quick and precise control of the gimbal towards the predicted target position.

4) They optimized YOLOv5 for detecting small objects like the armor plates by using strided convolutions instead of max pooling. 

5) They proposed techniques to compensate for water pellet dropping deviations using various regression algorithms fitted to actual drop data.

In summary, the main contribution is the complete automated system for robust detection, tracking and aiming at targets for the Robomaster robot during tactical battles. The integration of state-of-the-art deep learning and control algorithms is tailored for this specific application.
