# [Rapid detection of rare events from in situ X-ray diffraction data using   machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03989)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a machine learning-based technique to rapidly detect the onset of plastic deformation from high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) data of polycrystalline metallic samples under mechanical loading. The technique uses an image representation model based on self-supervised learning and a clustering algorithm to transform the HEDM data into compact representations capturing visually salient characteristics like diffraction peak shapes. These representations are then analyzed to compute a "rare event indicator" (REI) metric that is sensitive to changes in peak shapes indicating plasticity onset. Experiments on stainless steel, titanium alloys, and sand under tension/compression loading show the REI reliably detects yielding accommodated by crystallographic slip. The technique provides actionable insights over 50x faster than analyzing full HEDM data reconstructions. It works on partial 9x sparser HEDM data sets, enabling continuous loading experiments. The framework is also shown to detect changes in incident beam flux. Overall, this rapid anomaly detection technique can guide experimenters on when to deploy more detailed characterization techniques upon detection of rare yielding events from streaming HEDM data.
