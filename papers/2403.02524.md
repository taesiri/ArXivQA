# [Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing   kernel Hilbert spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating the Koopman operator from data is challenging. Methods like Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) have issues with spectral pollution and lack theoretical justification.
- It is unclear what function space the estimated "Koopman eigenfunctions" belong to when the Koopman operator does not preserve the space of observables.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "jets" and "intrinsic observables" to define finite-dimensional invariant subspaces (called $V_{p,n}$) in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).
- Propose a new method called Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD) which is an refinement of EDMD using the intrinsic observables. JetDMD involves truncating a matrix to its leading principal submatrix.
- Introduce the notion of an "extended Koopman operator" using rigged Hilbert spaces. Show that JetDMD approximates this extended operator and its eigenvectors, providing interpretation for estimated "Koopman eigenfunctions".

Main Contributions:
- Provide explicit error bounds and convergence rates for JetDMD with exponential and Gaussian kernels. Show it has superior performance in estimating Koopman operator eigenvalues.
- Elucidate mathematical machinery behind JetDMD's performance - truncation eliminates rapidly growing terms that cause issues in EDMD. 
- Introduce extended Koopman operator and show its Jordan-Chevalley decomposition and eigendecomposition. Eigenvectors are "Koopman eigenfunctions" in a weak sense.
- Demonstrate accurate reconstruction of dynamical systems from data using JetDMD. Provide theoretical guarantee on reconstruction capability.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled RKHS-based approach for estimating the Koopman operator and using it for system identification. The notion of extended Koopman operator also provides new perspectives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a new method called Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD) for estimating Koopman operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion of jets to enhance the estimation accuracy compared to Extended DMD. The method is proven to have superior theoretical performance bounds and illustrated through numerical simulations on dynamical systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the study of Koopman operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS):

1) It proposes a new method called Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD) for estimating the Koopman operator on an RKHS. JetDMD refines Extended DMD by using intrinsic observables constructed from the jets to enhance the accuracy of eigenvalue estimation. Explicit error bounds and convergence rates are provided.

2) It introduces the notion of an "extended" Koopman operator defined on a rigged Hilbert space, formed by the RKHS and dual spaces. This provides a framework for analyzing the spectrum and estimated eigenfunctions, allowing eigendecomposition outside the original RKHS. 

3) For specific kernels like Gaussian and exponential, it shows explicit convergence results for JetDMD and accurate estimation of the Perron-Frobenius operator. This provides theoretical justification for the truncation process in JetDMD.

4) It proposes a method for reconstructing dynamical systems from temporally-sampled trajectory data, with theoretical guarantees on accuracy. Performance is demonstrated on systems like the van der Pol oscillator and Lorenz attractor.

5) It clarifies the relationship between estimated "Koopman eigenfunctions" using observables, and eigenvectors of the extended Koopman operator. This helps interpret what is actually being approximated.

In summary, the key innovations are the JetDMD method, the extended Koopman operator framework, strong theoretical results for specific kernels, and the application to system reconstruction.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The notion of "jet" and the space of intrinsic observables play a central role in the proposed JetDMD method. Can you explain in more detail the mathematical motivation behind introducing jets and how they allow for the canonical construction of the intrinsic observables?

2) A key theoretical result is providing an explicit error bound and convergence rate for JetDMD in Theorem 4. Can you walk through the main steps in the proof of this result and discuss why truncating the matrix is essential for achieving convergence? 

3) The paper argues that eigenfunctions estimated via JetDMD should be interpreted as eigenvectors of an "extended Koopman operator" defined on a rigged Hilbert space. Can you explain the concept of a rigged Hilbert space and how it provides a framework for analyzing these estimated eigenfunctions?

4) For specific kernels like the Gaussian and exponential kernels, the paper shows improved error bounds by estimating quantities like $\|\mathcal{E}_{p,n}\|_{L^2(\mu)}$. Can you discuss the main techniques used to derive these improved bounds? 

5) The numerical simulations demonstrate that JetDMD can accurately estimate eigenvalues/eigenvectors and reconstruct dynamical systems. From a practical perspective, what are the main advantages of JetDMD over alternative methods like EDMD or Kernel DMD?

6) Assumption 2 in the paper requires that the space of intrinsic observables is contained in the domain of the Koopman operator. When might this assumption fail to hold and how would it impact the theoretical guarantees for JetDMD?

7) The notation and terminology around rigged Hilbert spaces and Gelfand triples is quite dense. For a reader unfamiliar with this theory, can you give an intuitive explanation of the key concepts and how they are applied in analyzing Koopman operators?

8) The capability to reconstruct unknown dynamical systems from data alone is a powerful application of JetDMD. However, what are some practical challenges or limitations one might encounter in implementing the system identification algorithms? 

9) The convergence analysis relies heavily on properties of the exponential and Gaussian kernels. How might the theory differ for other positive definite kernels? Are there specific conditions a kernel must satisfy for the error bound to hold?  

10) The paper focuses exclusively on estimation of Koopman operators for discrete-time dynamical systems. Can you discuss how the core ideas could be extended to handle continuous-time systems and approximations of the generator for Koopman semigroups?
