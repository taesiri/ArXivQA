# [OverFlow: Putting flows on top of neural transducers for better TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06892)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to improve text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis based on neural hidden Markov models (HMMs) by better modeling the highly non-Gaussian distribution of speech acoustics. 

The key hypothesis is that combining neural HMM TTS with normalizing flows will result in a powerful, fully probabilistic model of durations and acoustics that can be trained using exact maximum likelihood. This should improve the naturalness and accuracy of the synthesized speech compared to neural HMM TTS alone.

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called "OverFlow" which adds an invertible neural network, adapted from the Glow-TTS architecture, on top of a neural HMM TTS system. This allows modeling more complex acoustic distributions while retaining the benefits of neural HMMs like monotonic alignment. 

The experiments then validate if OverFlow improves subjective speech quality and pronunciation accuracy compared to neural HMM TTS and other baselines like Tacotron 2 and Glow-TTS. The goal is to show that the proposed integration of flows and neural HMMs advances the state of the art in probabilistic neural TTS.
