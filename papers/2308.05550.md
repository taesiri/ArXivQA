# [Cross-Domain Product Representation Learning for Rich-Content E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05550)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we learn unified product representations across different domains (product pages, short videos, live streams) in rich-content e-commerce? The key challenges outlined are:- Inconsistency in product presentation across different media domains (e.g. product pages vs short videos vs live streams)- Lack of existing methods and datasets focusing on cross-domain product representation for rich-content e-commerceTo address this, the paper introduces:- A new large-scale cross-domain product dataset called ROPE, covering product pages, videos and live streams- A Cross-dOmain Product rEpresentation (COPE) model to learn joint representations across domainsSo in summary, the main research focus is on developing cross-domain product representations to handle the changing nature of online shopping across different media formats like videos and live streams. The core hypothesis seems to be that a unified representation can be learned across these domains through multi-modal learning on a suitable dataset like the introduced ROPE dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. They introduce a large-scale cross-domain product dataset called ROPE, which contains product pages, short videos, and live streams across a wide range of product categories. This is the first dataset to cover these three domains for e-commerce. 2. They propose a Cross-dOmain Product rEpresentation (COPE) model to learn unified representations for products across the different domains. COPE uses shared encoders for visual and textual features, along with domain-specific projection layers.3. They evaluate COPE on cross-domain retrieval and few-shot classification tasks on the ROPE dataset. Results show COPE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning joint representations. 4. Analysis and visualizations are provided to illustrate that COPE can effectively distinguish between different products while mapping corresponding samples from different domains close together.In summary, the main contribution is the introduction of a novel cross-domain e-commerce dataset ROPE, and a COPE model that can learn unified product representations across product pages, videos, and live streams. This could enable better product search and recommendations in emerging rich-content e-commerce platforms.
