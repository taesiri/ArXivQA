# [Improved Consensus ADMM for Cooperative Motion Planning of Large-Scale   Connected Autonomous Vehicles with Limited Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09032)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of cooperative motion planning for large-scale connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) under limited vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Planning optimal, collision-free trajectories for a large number of CAVs is computationally complex. Existing methods either rely on long-range V2V communication or decompose the problem by treating each CAV separately, both of which have limitations in real-world driving. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an improved consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that can efficiently solve the cooperative planning problem in a decentralized manner while only requiring locally connected V2V communication. 

The key ideas are:

1) Formulate the planning problem as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP) that optimizes an objective function representing closeness to reference trajectories and control effort, subject to vehicle dynamics constraints, inter-vehicle collision avoidance constraints, and control/state limits.

2) Reformulate the OCP suitable for decentralized optimization using the consensus ADMM framework. The problem is split into subproblems for each CAV that coordinate through dual variable consensus. 

3) Improve computational efficiency of the dual updates from O(N^3) to O(N) by exploiting sparsity patterns in the coupling constraints.

4) Limit the size of each subproblem by introducing a graph evolution strategy that constructs locally connected subgraphs between CAVs based on a conditional Manhattan distance safety criterion.

5) Integrate the graph evolution and decentralized optimization in a receding horizon framework for enhanced robustness.


Main Contributions:

- An improved consensus ADMM algorithm that leverages problem structure to achieve linear complexity for large-scale cooperative planning problems.

- A graph evolution technique tailored to cooperative driving that dynamically constructs locally connected subgraphs to limit the size of each planning subproblem. 

- Integration of the above in a receding horizon framework leading to a computationally efficient and scalable solution for cooperative driving of many CAVs.

- Demonstration of real-time performance for 80 CAVs in high-fidelity urban driving simulations, showcasing efficiency, scalability and emergent cooperative behaviors.

The proposed research enables sophisticated coordination between large numbers of CAVs in complex environments, helping pave the way towards safe and efficient autonomous transportation systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an improved consensus ADMM algorithm integrated with a graph evolution strategy and receding horizon framework to achieve efficient decentralized cooperative motion planning for large-scale connected autonomous vehicles under realistic communication constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. An improved consensus ADMM algorithm is proposed to solve the cooperative motion planning problem for connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with a locally connected topology network. This algorithm decomposes the overall optimal control problem (OCP) into parallel sub-problems and achieves a time complexity of O(N) by exploiting sparsity in the dual update process.

2. A graph evolution strategy is presented to characterize the interaction patterns among CAVs using a dynamic connectivity graph. This limits the scale of each sub-problem that needs to be solved, further enhancing computational efficiency. 

3. A closed-loop framework is proposed that integrates the graph evolution strategy in a receding horizon fashion to enable cooperative motion planning for large-scale CAVs. This framework formulates decentralized OCPs within each subgraph and solves them in parallel using the improved consensus ADMM algorithm.

4. Comprehensive simulations involving 80 CAVs in the CARLA simulator demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology for large-scale cooperative driving tasks. The results highlight real-time performance and robust cooperative behaviors among CAVs.

In summary, the key innovation is the integration of parallel optimization, graph evolution, and receding horizon control to achieve real-time decentralized cooperative motion planning for large numbers of CAVs. This enables scalable and efficient coordination of CAV maneuvers in complex urban driving scenarios.
