# [Llama meets EU: Investigating the European Political Spectrum through   the Lens of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work has explored political biases in LLMs, but focused on the binary US political context (Democrats vs Republicans) using non-conversational models like BERT. 
- Open questions remain around using LLMs to explore political biases in a more diverse European context, leveraging actual political debates, and aligning conversational chat-based LLMs to political parties.

Methodology:
- Use parliamentary debates from the EU Parliament and the EUANDI political questionnaire.
- Audit the conversational Llama Chat model on its political knowledge and reasoning abilities in context using EUANDI. 
- Adapt Llama Chat by fine-tuning on speeches of individual EU political parties to analyze how adaptation affects the model's alignment and biases.

Key Findings:  
- Llama Chat shows considerable knowledge of national parties' positions and can reason on politics when prompted with justifications.
- Fine-tuning on euro-parties' speeches substantially re-aligns the models towards respective political positions. Works better for ideologically "consistent" parties.  
- See adapted models as data-driven mirrors of parties' ideologies to use LLMs as conversational assistants for political science research.

Main Contributions:
- Release new dataset of EU parliamentary debates.
- Audit LLMs on political knowledge and reasoning abilities in a European context. 
- Demonstrate realignment of conversational LLMs to political parties through fine-tuning.
- Establish basis to use adapted LLMs as assistants for political science research.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!
