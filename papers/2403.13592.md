# [Llama meets EU: Investigating the European Political Spectrum through   the Lens of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13592)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work has explored political biases in LLMs, but focused on the binary US political context (Democrats vs Republicans) using non-conversational models like BERT. 
- Open questions remain around using LLMs to explore political biases in a more diverse European context, leveraging actual political debates, and aligning conversational chat-based LLMs to political parties.

Methodology:
- Use parliamentary debates from the EU Parliament and the EUANDI political questionnaire.
- Audit the conversational Llama Chat model on its political knowledge and reasoning abilities in context using EUANDI. 
- Adapt Llama Chat by fine-tuning on speeches of individual EU political parties to analyze how adaptation affects the model's alignment and biases.

Key Findings:  
- Llama Chat shows considerable knowledge of national parties' positions and can reason on politics when prompted with justifications.
- Fine-tuning on euro-parties' speeches substantially re-aligns the models towards respective political positions. Works better for ideologically "consistent" parties.  
- See adapted models as data-driven mirrors of parties' ideologies to use LLMs as conversational assistants for political science research.

Main Contributions:
- Release new dataset of EU parliamentary debates.
- Audit LLMs on political knowledge and reasoning abilities in a European context. 
- Demonstrate realignment of conversational LLMs to political parties through fine-tuning.
- Establish basis to use adapted LLMs as assistants for political science research.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions on the summary!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the political knowledge and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models in the context of EU politics, adapts models to speeches of different euro-parties to analyze their alignment, and proposes using adapted models to aid research in political science.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors investigate the political knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama Chat in the context of European Union politics. This expands prior work that has focused more on US two-party politics.

2) They introduce a contextualized auditing methodology to probe the models' understanding, where they provide relevant context like a political party's name or justification before asking the model to predict the party's position.  

3) They release two new datasets - the EU Debates corpus of 87k speeches from the European Parliament, and a cleaned version of the EUandi political questionnaire.

4) They show that Llama Chat has substantial prior knowledge of national parties' positions, and can reason about politics when provided relevant context. Its accuracy varies across political groups.

5) They demonstrate that fine-tuning Llama Chat on speeches by specific euro-parties can re-align the model ideologically towards those parties' positions. This works better for parties with more consistent ideologies.

In summary, the key contribution is using LLMs to explore political biases and knowledge in the context of diverse EU politics, developing contextualized auditing methods, releasing useful new datasets, and showing these models can be adapted to reflect parties' stances. The authors frame this as a starting point to use LLMs to assist political science research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Llama Chat
- Political biases/leanings 
- European politics
- European Parliament
- Euro-parties
- EUANDI questionnaire
- Contextualized auditing
- Political adaptation/alignment
- Conversational engines
- Political science research

The paper investigates the political biases and leanings of LLMs like Llama Chat in the context of European politics and the diverse political spectrum of the European Union. It audits Llama Chat on the EUANDI questionnaire in different contextualized settings to analyze its political knowledge and reasoning abilities. The paper also explores adapting/aligning Llama Chat to different Euro-parties' ideologies using parliamentary debates, and evaluates how this affects the model's alignment. Overall, the goal is to use LLMs like conversational engines to potentially inform and assist research in political science. The key terms reflect this focus and the different experiments conducted in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper adapts Llama Chat models on speeches from different European political parties. What was the motivation behind choosing the specific parties (EPP, S&D, Greens/EFA, GUE/NGL, ID) to adapt the models on? 

2. The paper uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune Llama Chat on the speeches. Why was LoRA chosen over other fine-tuning methods? What are the advantages of using LoRA here?

3. The adapted models are evaluated on the EUANDI questionnaire. What modifications, if any, were made to the questionnaire or the evaluation process to better fit the context of adapted partisan models?

4. The paper identifies a discrepancy between model responses and justifications, requiring manual analysis. What could be the reasons behind this? How can this issue be mitigated in future work?

5. For big tent parties like EPP and S&D, model adaptation exhibits lower alignment compared to more ideologically unified parties. Why does this happen and how can adaptation be improved for such broad church parties?  

6. The model adaptations result in clear re-alignment on the EU political spectrum. But are there any dimensions where re-alignment is lacking? If yes, what could be the reasons and solutions?

7. The data exhibits class imbalance with some EUANDI categories being discussed much less. How does this imbalance affect model adaptation and evaluation? How can it be addressed?

8. The study focuses only on English language models due to constraints. How will the findings differ with multilingual models trained on original non-English speeches? 

9. Can this approach of adaptation and evaluation be extended to other contexts like national parliaments across Europe? What changes would be required to methodology?

10. The paper proposes using adapted models as data-driven mirrors of party ideology to assist political science research. What are some real-world use cases and applications that can benefit from this?
