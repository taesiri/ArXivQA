## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in deterministic human motion prediction based on 3D skeletons. It categorizes and discusses innovations from the perspective of model inputs, internal structures, and outputs. For model inputs, employing multi-granularity representations and dual-stream networks helps capture diverse spatial-temporal contexts. Regarding internal structures, Graph Neural Networks and Transformers have emerged as mainstream architectures, with modifications like attention mechanisms and equivariant operations further enhancing feature learning. As for outputs, techniques like residual prediction and memory networks allow accumulating long-term dependencies. The paper also analyzes common datasets and metrics, compares state-of-the-art methods, and discusses remaining challenges like improving spatiotemporal dependency modeling, designing better loss functions, and collecting larger datasets. Overall, this review offers readers valuable insights into the latest trends and future directions within this rapidly developing field.
