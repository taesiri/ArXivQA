# [STEERER: Resolving Scale Variations for Counting and Localization via   Selective Inheritance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10468)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective method to address the problem of scale variations in object counting tasks?The key hypothesis is that selectively inheriting discriminative scale-specific features from lower to higher resolutions can help build scale-robust representations and density maps for improved counting performance. In particular, the paper proposes a novel method called STEERER (SelecTivE inhERitance lEaRning) with two main components:1) A Feature Selection and Inheritance Adaptor (FSIA) module that disentangles multi-resolution features into scale-customized and scale-uncustomized parts before fusion. It selectively combines scale-customized lower-level features with higher-resolution features for progressive feature enhancement.2) A Masked Selection and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) that uses a Patch-Winner Selection Principle to choose the best scale for each image region. This supervises the network to focus on scale-specialized features at each resolution and progressively inherit them to aggregate features across scales.The central hypothesis is that by inheriting customized scale features in this selective manner, STEERER can learn robust scale-aware representations for density map prediction, significantly improving counting performance despite scale variations. Experiments on various counting datasets validate this hypothesis and the effectiveness of STEERER.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new method called STEERER (SeleceTivE inhERitance lEaRning) to address the issue of scale variations in object counting. The main contributions are:1. A Feature Selection and Inheritance Adaptor (FSIA) module that disentangles multi-resolution features into scale-customized and scale-uncustomized components before fusing them. This enables selective inheritance of discriminative features across scales. 2. A Masked Selection and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) supervised by a Patch-Winner Selection Principle to automatically select the optimal scale for each image region. This maximizes the discriminative power of features at their most suitable scales.3. Progressive optimization objectives imposed on the FSIA at each resolution to maximize its capabilities for selective inheritance learning. This progressively empowers the model with scaling generalization ability.4. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple counting and localization benchmarks by combining FSIA and MSIL, demonstrating the effectiveness of selective inheritance learning for handling scale variations.In summary, the core idea is to selectively inherit and fuse only the discriminative scale-customized features across multiple resolutions, rather than fusing all features which can be suboptimal. This allows concentrating the most useful features from each scale range for improved counting and localization accuracy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new method called STEERER for object counting that resolves scale variations by selectively inheriting discriminative features from the most suitable scales in a multi-resolution representation to progressively obtain customized features for improved counting and localization accuracy.
