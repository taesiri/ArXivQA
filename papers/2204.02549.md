# C3KG: A Chinese Commonsense Conversation Knowledge Graph

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the key research focuses of this paper are:1. To create a large-scale Chinese commonsense conversation knowledge graph (C3KG) that incorporates both social commonsense knowledge and dialog flow information. 2. To collect and annotate a multi-turn human-written conversation corpus for extracting dialog flow information.3. To develop methods to match events in the conversation corpus to a commonsense knowledge base (ATOMIC), and construct different types of dialog flow edges between them. 4. To benchmark graph-grounded conversation modeling tasks like emotion classification and intent prediction using the constructed knowledge graph.The main hypothesis is that augmenting a commonsense knowledge base like ATOMIC with dialog flow information can produce a knowledge graph more suitable and beneficial for empathetic conversation modeling. The paper aims to demonstrate this by creating C3KG and showing its potential on benchmark tasks.In summary, the key research questions are around developing methods to construct a conversational commonsense knowledge graph, and evaluating its utility for conversation modeling tasks compared to using just the base knowledge base alone. The central hypothesis is that incorporating dialog flow information into a commonsense knowledge base can better facilitate empathetic conversational agents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors curate a new Chinese corpus, CConv, containing multi-turn human-written conversations on daily life topics with rich annotations on the sub-utterance level. 2. They create the first large-scale Chinese commonsense conversation knowledge graph C^3KG, which incorporates both social commonsense knowledge from ATOMIC and dialog flow information extracted from CConv. C^3KG contains 4 unique types of dialog flow relations - event flow, concept flow, emotion-cause flow, emotion-intent flow.3. The authors develop a graph-conversation matching approach and benchmark two graph-grounded conversational tasks - emotion classification and intent prediction. 4. They provide the code, data, and benchmark tasks to facilitate future research on Chinese commonsense conversation modeling.In summary, the main contribution is the creation of a high-quality Chinese multi-turn conversation corpus CConv, a large commonsense conversation knowledge graph C^3KG with novel dialog flow relations, and the benchmark tasks and models for graph-grounded conversation modeling. The resources introduced in this paper could enable future research on Chinese empathetic chatbots.
