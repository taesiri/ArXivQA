# [Time-series Initialization and Conditioning for Video-agnostic   Stabilization of Video Super-Resolution using Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are useful for video super-resolution (VSR) due to their ability to model long-term dependencies. However, it is challenging to train RNNs on long videos due to issues like vanishing/exploding gradients and high memory requirements. 
- A common solution is to train the RNN on short cropped video clips with randomly initialized hidden states. However, this causes a domain gap between the random hidden states seen during training and the sequentially accumulated hidden states seen during inference on long videos. This domain gap degrades VSR performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Partial-Initialization Backpropagation Through Time (PI-BPTT) training scheme that trains the VSR network with more variety of hidden states that are dependent on video properties. This helps stabilize VSR performance across videos of differing lengths and dynamics.

- Efficiently train the VSR network by reusing computed hidden states across multiple short training clips instead of discarding after every clip. This provides a trade-off between efficiency and overfitting.

- Further improve stability by conditioning the RNN on the frame number, allowing it to modulate VSR difficulty based on recurrent steps.

Main Contributions:
- Show through experiments that VSR artifacts can change substantially depending on video properties like length, texture, motion and intensity changes.

- Propose PI-BPTT to train RNN-VSR networks on varied hidden states while reusing states for efficiency. Demonstrate improved VSR quality compared to baseline methods, especially on long videos.

- Analyze the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy by reusing hidden states. Accuracy peaks at minimal reuse while efficiency improves with more reuse. 

- Evaluate video-agnostic VSR performance on a diverse test set containing short, long, static and dynamic videos. PI-BPTT outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, this paper identifies domain gap issues in RNN-VSR training and proposes methodologies to stabilize performance across diverse videos, contributing more generalized VSR.
