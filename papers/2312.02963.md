## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces MVHumanNet, a large-scale multi-view human image dataset comprising 4,500 human identities, 9,000 daily outfits, 60,000 motion sequences, and 645 million frames captured by a 48-camera system. The key focus is on scaling up diverse everyday human clothing data to enable advancement of 3D digital human research. Extensive annotations like masks, camera parameters, 2D/3D keypoints, SMPL parameters, and text descriptions are provided. Experiments demonstrate MVHumanNet's ability to improve view-consistent action recognition, generalizable NeRF reconstruction for humans, text-conditioned image generation, and 2D/3D avatar generation. As the currently largest real-world multi-view human dataset with 10 times more data than prior works, MVHumanNet sets the foundation to overcome data limitations and motivate future innovations in human-centric tasks. The targeted capture of casual clothing is crucial for achieving unprecedented scale. Comprehensive experiments prove the performance boost enabled by sufficient data, highlighting opportunities to redesign algorithms without relying on coarse human body priors.
