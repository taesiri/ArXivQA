# [Do Embodied Agents Dream of Pixelated Sheep: Embodied Decision Making   using Language Guided World Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be: 

Can an agent effectively utilize large language models (LLMs) to improve exploration and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning?

Specifically, the authors propose a method where an LLM is used to hypothesize an "Abstract World Model" (AWM) representing dependencies between subgoals. This AWM is then used to guide exploration during training, rather than relying directly on (potentially inaccurate) LLM outputs at test time. The key hypothesis seems to be that using LLMs in this way to bootstrap learning of the AWM will improve sample efficiency and enable the agent to successfully blend knowledge from the LLM with its own grounded experience.

The experiments involving crafting items in Minecraft are designed to test whether LLM-guided exploration enables the agent (called DECKARD) to more efficiently craft complex items compared to tabula rasa methods. The authors also test the robustness of their approach to errors in the LLM-predicted AWM. Overall, the central question appears to be whether and how noisy LLM knowledge can be effectively utilized through the AWM to improve reinforcement learning exploration and sample efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing an agent called DECKARD (DECision-making for Knowledgable Autonomous Reinforcement-learning Dreamers) that uses a large language model (LLM) to hypothesize an Abstract World Model (AWM) for improving exploration and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. 

Specifically, DECKARD operates in two phases:

1) Dream Phase: Uses the LLM to decompose a task into a sequence of subgoals and predict dependencies between subgoals, forming a hypothesized AWM graph. 

2) Wake Phase: Learns modular policies for each subgoal using RL, and verifies or corrects the AWM graph based on experience in the environment. 

The key ideas are:

- Using the LLM to predict a high-level AWM graph over subgoals rather than directly generate action plans. This allows verifying the AWM through experience to overcome LLM inaccuracies.

- Guiding exploration through the predicted AWM graph during training. This improves sample efficiency compared to learning tabula rasa. 

- Learning modular policies for subgoals that can be composed to solve complex tasks.

The authors demonstrate these ideas in Minecraft crafting tasks, where DECKARD with LLM-predicted AWM achieves 10-12x higher sample efficiency compared to baseline RL algorithms. The method is also robust to errors in the LLM's hypothesized AWM.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel approach to effectively incorporate knowledge from LLMs into RL agents through an LLM-hypothesized AWM that is verified/corrected by experience, improving exploration and sample efficiency. The benefits are empirically demonstrated in Minecraft domain.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an agent called DECKARD that uses a large language model to hypothesize a graph of subgoal dependencies for a task, then verifies and corrects this graph through grounded experience in a Minecraft environment, improving sample efficiency and exploration.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of reinforcement learning and language-guided agents:

- The key idea of using a large language model (LLM) to hypothesize an abstract world model, which is then verified through interaction, is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on using LLMs to directly generate action sequences, which can be brittle. Using the LLM for high-level exploration guidance is an interesting alternative approach.

- The idea of modular policies and composing them to solve longer horizon tasks has been explored before, but applying it in combination with LLM-guided exploration is a nice way to improve sample efficiency. 

- The Minecraft domain has been tackled by a variety of RL methods before, but they often rely on hand-designed rewards or demonstrations. This paper shows that an LLM combined with modular policies can make progress on complex Minecraft tasks without any task-specific reward engineering.

- The approach of alternating between dreaming (using the LLM) and waking (environment interaction) is intuitive and meshes well with the overall idea. The dreaming phase sets up goals for exploration, while the waking phase grounds those goals in real experience.

- The robustness experiments are important for demonstrating that the approach can overcome errors in the LLM's knowledge. This is a key concern when using LLMs for decision making, and the paper shows the method does not just blindly follow the LLM.

- The gains in sample efficiency are quite significant compared to prior RL approaches. Though hard to compare directly due to different settings, it seems to advance state-of-the-art on difficult exploration tasks like Minecraft item crafting.

Overall, I think the ideas introduced in this paper around LLM-guided exploration, modular policies, and alternating dreaming/waking phases advance the state-of-the-art in applying large pretrained models to improve RL agents. The gains on Minecraft demonstrate these ideas can work in complex 3D environments requiring long-term planning and exploration.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing methods to automatically identify useful state abstractions when constructing the Abstract World Model (AWM), rather than relying on a predefined abstraction like the inventory state.

- Extending the approach to handle stochastic transitions in the AWM, rather than just deterministic transitions. 

- Removing the requirement for environments to already have a grounding in language and developing methods to automatically generate grounded state descriptions from things like images. The authors note some preliminary work in this direction by Tam et al. (2022).

- Further improving the robustness of methods like DECKARD that apply LLM knowledge, to handle even higher error rates or more systematic errors in the LLM outputs.

- Scaling up and evaluating the approach on more complex environments beyond Minecraft.

- Exploring whether similar LLM-guided exploration could be applied in a model-free RL setting, rather than the model-based approach of learning the AWM.

- Developing multi-task versions of the approach that can leverage knowledge in the AWM to quickly solve multiple related tasks.

- Combining the approach with methods that learn dynamics models, to predict state transitions and corrections to the AWM.

So in summary, some key directions are developing more automated versions of the approach, scaling it up to more complex tasks, improving robustness, and combining it with model-learning, multi-task learning, and model-free RL methods. The authors frame their work as an initial demonstration of effectively grounding noisy LLM knowledge, opening up many avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DECKARD (DECision-making for Knowledgable Autonomous Reinforcement-learning Dreamers), an agent that uses large language models (LLMs) to guide exploration and improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. DECKARD operates in two phases - a Dream phase where it hypothesizes an Abstract World Model (AWM) by prompting an LLM to decompose a task into subgoals, and a Wake phase where it executes the subgoals, learns modular policies for them, and verifies or corrects the AWM. DECKARD is applied to crafting items in Minecraft, where the AWM represents dependencies between items. LLM-guided exploration allows DECKARD to craft items 10x faster than ablated versions without LLM guidance. The method is also robust to errors in the LLM-predicted AWM. Overall, the paper demonstrates that noisy knowledge from LLMs can be effectively combined with grounded experience from the environment to improve exploration and sample efficiency in RL.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents DECISION-MAKING FOR KNOWLEDGEABLE AUTONOMOUS REINFORCEMENT-LEARNING DREAMERS (DECKARD), an agent that uses large language models (LLMs) to guide exploration and learn faster in reinforcement learning environments with sparse rewards like Minecraft. DECKARD operates in two phases: a Dream phase where it prompts an LLM to hypothesize an Abstract World Model (AWM) by decomposing a task into subgoals, and a Wake phase where it executes the subgoals, verifying and correcting the AWM. For example, to craft a pickaxe the LLM might decompose this into subgoals of collecting wood and stone. DECKARD then explores to achieve those subgoals, learning whether the LLM's hypothesized transitions between subgoals match the environment dynamics.

Experiments in Minecraft show DECKARD explores over twice as fast as without LLM guidance. When optimizing to craft a specific item, DECKARD improves sample efficiency by 12x over baselines. The method is also robust to errors in the LLM hypothesized AWM. Overall, DECKARD demonstrates how noisy knowledge from LLMs can effectively guide exploration in reinforcement learning, greatly improving sample efficiency in sparse reward environments like Minecraft where naive exploration fails. The authors highlight the potential for large pretrained models to provide useful prior knowledge to RL agents as long as that knowledge is verified through grounded experience.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an agent called DECKARD (DECision-making for Knowledgeable Autonomous Reinforcement-learning Dreamers) that uses a large language model (LLM) to hypothesize an Abstract World Model (AWM) representing dependencies between subgoals, which it then verifies through interaction with the Minecraft environment. DECKARD operates in two alternating phases: the Dream phase where it samples the next subgoal to explore from the LLM-predicted AWM, and the Wake phase where it executes and learns modular policies for subgoals, grounding the AWM in real environment dynamics. By initializing exploration with an LLM-predicted AWM and then verifying it through experience, DECKARD is able to efficiently explore complex crafting spaces like Minecraft's technology tree, improving sample efficiency over traditional tabula rasa reinforcement learning by an order of magnitude. The method demonstrates how noisy knowledge from LLMs can be robustly combined with grounded experience for efficient exploration and learning in RL.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to effectively leverage large language models (LLMs) as a source of prior knowledge to improve exploration and sample efficiency. 

Specifically, the authors propose a method to use LLMs to hypothesize an "Abstract World Model" (AWM) that decomposes tasks into sequences of subgoals. The AWM acts as a prior over environment dynamics that can guide the agent's exploration. The key idea is that the hypothesized AWM from the LLM provides high-level guidance, but is verified and corrected through the agent's grounded experience in the environment.

The research question seems to be: can noisy, ungrounded knowledge from large pretrained language models be combined with grounded experience from an RL agent to significantly improve exploration and sample efficiency?

The authors test their method in Minecraft, where sparse rewards make exploration difficult. They aim to show that their agent, DECKARD, can use LLM guidance to craft items much faster than traditional RL algorithms by decomposing crafting tasks into predicted prerequisite subgoals.

In summary, the key problem is leveraging ungrounded LLM knowledge to improve RL exploration, with the research question focusing on whether their proposed hybrid LLM/RL method can blend these noisy information sources to achieve efficient learning in Minecraft crafting tasks.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize an Abstract World Model (AWM) to improve exploration in reinforcement learning. How does the AWM help guide the agent's exploration versus exploring completely from scratch? What are the key benefits of having the AWM for exploration?

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes DECKARD, an embodied reinforcement learning agent for Minecraft that uses a large language model (LLM) to hypothesize an Abstract World Model (AWM) representing subgoals and transitions between them. DECKARD operates in two phases: a Dream phase where it samples a subgoal path from the LLM-predicted AWM, and a Wake phase where it executes subgoals along the path, learning modular policies for each subgoal.
