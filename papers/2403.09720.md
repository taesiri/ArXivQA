# [Fine-tuning vs Prompting, Can Language Models Understand Human Values?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Accurately detecting human values underlying arguments is challenging but important for understanding speakers' perspectives. 
- Existing datasets for this task have limitations like small size and cultural biases. The new Touche23-ValueEval dataset aims to address these issues.

Proposed Solutions:
- Explore fine-tuning and prompt tuning of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for human value detection using the Touche23 dataset. 
- Validate if models can effectively solve the problem using only pre-training knowledge.
- Examine capabilities of large language models (LLMs) aligned with human preferences on this task.

Methods:
- Fine-tune RoBERTa and DeBERTa as classifiers with contrastive learning to improve embeddings.
- Prompt tuning using techniques like binary choice, open answering with knowledgeable verbalizers, and chain-of-thought (CoT).
- Qualitatively test LLMs with CoT prompting without gradient updates.

Key Results:
- Fine-tuning achieves macro F1 of 0.54, improved using contrastive learning. 
- Prompt tuning struggles with complexity for models <1B parameters but matches fine-tuning performance for 1B+ parameter models.  
- LLMs show promising human value detection performance when prompted effectively.

Main Contributions:
- First study examining fine-tuning vs prompting for human value detection using Touche23 dataset.
- Demonstrates prompting can match fine-tuning given large enough model and that both have tradeoffs.
- Shows pre-trained knowledge in LLMs can support human value detection through effective prompting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores fine-tuning versus prompting for detecting human values in text, finding that prompting can match fine-tuning given a large enough model size, while fine-tuning is more stable for smaller models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Comparing fine-tuning and prompt tuning for the complex downstream task of human value detection. The authors find that prompt tuning can match or exceed fine-tuning performance when using large enough language models, while fine-tuning is more stable for smaller models. 

2) Evaluating the capability of pre-trained language models to handle human value detection based just on pre-training knowledge, using prompting techniques. The authors find that large language models like LLMs can perform surprisingly well on the task when provided with a well-designed prompting approach.

3) Analyzing the tradeoffs between fine-tuning and prompt tuning more broadly. The authors highlight that each approach has strengths and weaknesses, and considerations like model size, task complexity, sample availability, computational constraints, etc. need to be weighed when selecting an approach in practice.

In summary, the key contribution is a set of experiments and analysis exploring fine-tuning versus prompt tuning on a complex language understanding task, providing insight into their respective capabilities and tradeoffs. The findings on prompting large models are also notable.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper explores both fine-tuning and prompt tuning for the human values detection task. What are the key differences in how these two methods leverage pre-trained language models? What are the trade-offs between them?

2. Contrastive learning is used during fine-tuning to obtain better sequence representations. How exactly is the contrastive loss computed in the context of this multi-label classification task? What impact did this technique have on performance?

3. Several prompt tuning templates are proposed, including binary choice, open answering, and chain of thought. Can you explain the key ideas and mechanics behind each one? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

4. The paper finds prompt tuning struggles to match fine-tuning performance without using very large pre-trained models. What factors drive this requirement for larger model capacity in prompt tuning?

5. Additional experiments on NLI and few-shot learning highlight different trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompt tuning. How do the results in these settings provide more nuance?

6. The chain of thought prompting approach is used with large language models. What is the motivation for this technique? How does it aim to leverage the reasoning and knowledge capabilities of models like Llama and ChatGPT?  

7. What analysis does the paper provide regarding differences in performance across the multiple human values categories? What might explain some categories seeing much lower scores?

8. How viable and effective do you think the best approaches explored in this paper could be for real-world application? What further analysis or improvements are needed?

9. What are some other prompting strategies the authors could have explored? For example, demonstrations or in-context learning. Would these be promising directions?

10. The authors note several limitations around comparing fine-tuning and prompt tuning performance. If you could design a follow-up study, how would you address these to enable a more controlled comparison?
