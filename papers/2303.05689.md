# [Inducing Neural Collapse to a Fixed Hierarchy-Aware Frame for Reducing   Mistake Severity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05689)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we reduce the severity of mistakes made by a deep neural network image classifier by inducing the network's features to collapse onto a hierarchy-aware frame rather than an equiangular tight frame?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Fixing the classifier layer of a neural network to a hierarchy-aware frame (HAFrame) that encodes the semantic relationships between classes will bias mistakes to be less severe based on the class hierarchy. 2) Adding a cosine similarity-based auxiliary loss will further facilitate the collapse of features onto the desired HAFrame and hierarchy-aware structure.3) This approach of fixing the classifier to a HAFrame and using an auxiliary loss will reduce mistake severity while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to other methods.So in summary, the main research question is about reducing mistake severity in image classification by imposing a certain structure on the network through the classifier and loss function. The key hypotheses are that fixing the classifier to a HAFrame and using a cosine similarity loss will induce features to collapse onto the desired hierarchy-aware structure and reduce mistake severity.
