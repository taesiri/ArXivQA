# [Inducing Neural Collapse to a Fixed Hierarchy-Aware Frame for Reducing   Mistake Severity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05689)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How can we reduce the severity of mistakes made by a deep neural network image classifier by inducing the network's features to collapse onto a hierarchy-aware frame rather than an equiangular tight frame?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Fixing the classifier layer of a neural network to a hierarchy-aware frame (HAFrame) that encodes the semantic relationships between classes will bias mistakes to be less severe based on the class hierarchy. 

2) Adding a cosine similarity-based auxiliary loss will further facilitate the collapse of features onto the desired HAFrame and hierarchy-aware structure.

3) This approach of fixing the classifier to a HAFrame and using an auxiliary loss will reduce mistake severity while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to other methods.

So in summary, the main research question is about reducing mistake severity in image classification by imposing a certain structure on the network through the classifier and loss function. The key hypotheses are that fixing the classifier to a HAFrame and using a cosine similarity loss will induce features to collapse onto the desired hierarchy-aware structure and reduce mistake severity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to induce neural collapse of a deep neural network to a fixed hierarchy-aware frame (HAFrame) instead of an equiangular tight frame (ETF). This is done in order to reduce the mistake severity of the model's predictions while maintaining classification accuracy. The key ideas include:

- Mapping the hierarchical distances between classes to target cosine similarities using an exponential function. This encodes the class hierarchy into the HAFrame. 

- Providing an analytical solution to construct the HAFrame from a positive definite similarity matrix derived from the hierarchy.

- Adding a transformation layer and fixing the classifier weights to the HAFrame. 

- Using a cosine similarity-based auxiliary loss to facilitate the penultimate features collapsing onto the HAFrame.

- Demonstrating on several datasets that this approach reduces the average mistake severity and hierarchical distance of incorrect predictions while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to previous methods.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a straightforward way to modify a neural network to induce collapse onto a hierarchy-aware structure rather than an ETF in order to reduce mistake severity based on the class hierarchy.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes fixing the classifier weights of a deep neural network to a hierarchy-aware frame derived from the semantic relationships between classes, and using an auxiliary cosine similarity loss to induce the penultimate features to collapse onto this fixed frame, in order to reduce the severity of classification mistakes according to the class hierarchy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in hierarchical image classification:

- The main novelty of this paper is in using the recently discovered neural collapse phenomenon to reduce mistake severity in a hierarchy-aware manner. It builds on prior work like ETF-classifiers that also leverage neural collapse, but does so in a way tailored for hierarchical classification by collapsing features onto a hierarchy-aware frame (HAFrame) rather than an equiangular tight frame (ETF).

- Compared to other hierarchy-aware methods, this paper's approach is relatively simple - it only requires modifying the classifier layer to the proposed HAFrame and adding an auxiliary loss. This is an advantage over methods requiring more architectural changes to the network. It is also adaptable to different hierarchies.

- For incorporating hierarchy, this paper uses a simple mapping between hierarchical distances and cosine similarities to construct the HAFrame. Other works have used more complex methods like hyperbolic embeddings or graph models. The mapping here is intuitive and analytical.

- The paper compares against recent strong baselines like CRM, Flamingo, and HAFeature. The experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art or competitive results in reducing mistake severity and average hierarchical distance while maintaining accuracy. 

- One limitation is that the approach relies on predefined label hierarchies and does not learn the relationships like some embedding-based methods. The hierarchies are also constrained to trees rather than DAGs.

Overall, the paper offers a simple yet effective approach to reduce mistake severity in hierarchical classification by inducing a targeted neural collapse phenomenon. The novelty lies in tailoring neural collapse to hierarchy through the proposed HAFrame and associated training modifications. The results demonstrate strong improvements over baselines, showing the promise of this direction.
