# [On the Standardization of Behavioral Use Clauses and Their Adoption for   Responsible Licensing of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are growing concerns over potential misuse or harm from increasingly capable AI models and systems. However, many researchers want to openly release their models to enable decentralization and accessibility. This creates a tension between openness and responsible use.  
- Existing open source licenses like MIT and Apache 2.0 do not contain restrictions on how models can be used. Some large companies have created customized terms, but this is not feasible for most researchers. The choice becomes either releasing with no restrictions or not releasing at all.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper advocates using "responsible AI licenses" which contain additional "behavioral use clauses" that restrict potential misuse while still allowing open release. These have been gaining adoption recently.

Key Contributions:

- Analysis of 170,000+ model repositories shows rapid growth in adoption of responsible AI licenses, especially "RAIL" licenses. 24% of repos now use RAIL, driven by major model releases like BLOOM, LLaMA2, Stable Diffusion.

- Interviews with researchers adopting these licenses show they fill the gap between willingness to release openly and concerns over potential misuse. Existing licenses did not match values or restrictions needed.

- Comparison of license clauses shows consistency around restricting discrimination, legal violations, disinformation but differences in other areas like healthcare and military uses.

- The paper argues that both standardization AND some customization are needed - standardized to avoid confusing users, but customizable restrictions for different contexts.

- Proposes ideas like a "license generator" tool that supports customization while keeping a common base set of restrictions, and "code scans" to check compatibility with dependencies.

In summary, the paper shows rapidly growing adoption of responsible AI licenses, but argues for increased standardization alongside supporting customization to enable broader use while restricting potential harms.
