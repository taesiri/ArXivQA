## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for comprehensive math word problem (MWP) datasets to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially Chinese LLMs. 
- Existing datasets either focus on English or lack fine-grained categories and difficulty levels to enable detailed analysis.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new dataset called FineMath containing 1,584 elementary-level Chinese MWPs.
- The questions are categorized into 17 types covering major mathematical concepts like numbers, algebra, geometry etc.
- Each type has questions of 3 difficulty levels based on number of reasoning steps needed.
- Questions are also provided in multiple choice format to enable automatic evaluation.

Main Contributions:
- A fine-grained benchmark for assessing mathematical capabilities of Chinese LLMs from 3 aspects: understanding concepts, reasoning accuracy and overall accuracy. 
- Detailed data statistics and contamination analysis to examine credibility of evaluation results.
- Evaluation of 9 LLMs including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, revealing current abilities and limitations in math reasoning.
- Analysis showing factors like prompts and evaluation methods significantly impact measured performance, highlighting need for careful benchmark design.

In summary, the paper introduces a new meticulously designed benchmark dataset to drive progress in mathematical reasoning of Chinese language models through more rigorous evaluation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions dividing math word problems into 17 categories according to key math concepts. What were the principles/standards used to define these 17 categories? Do you think more granular or higher-level categories would be better for analysis?

2. The paper manually annotates the number of reasoning steps required for each math word problem. What guidelines were provided to human annotators for deciding the number of reasoning steps? How was agreement measured between different annotators?

3. Contamination analysis is performed between the FineMath dataset and Ape210K training set. What other publicly available Chinese math word problem training sets could be checked for potential contamination? Would it be useful to report performance on contaminated vs clean splits?

4. The accuracy results in Figure 3 use prompt 0 with no additional context provided to models. How sensitive are the accuracy results to changes in prompt? Would a standardized prompt be better for comparison? 

5. Table 4 analyzes model performance on problems requiring different numbers of reasoning steps. Do you think the ordering of problems based on required reasoning steps affects the analysis? How else could reasoning complexity be quantified?

6. The paper transformation math word problems into multiple choice questions. Do you think this better evaluates real mathematical reasoning compared to free-form answer generation? What are the limitations?

7. Analysis in Table 5 indicates performance differences between multiple choice and free form answer generation. What factors account most for these differences across models? Is one evaluation format better?

8. How was ground truth answer generation and verification conducted for the FineMath problems? What quality controls were in place to ensure correctness? 

9. For real-world usage, what types of hints could be provided by the questioning system to reduce reasoning steps without revealing answers directly?

10. The FineMath dataset focuses on elementary school math word problems. What considerations would extending to middle school or high school problems introduce? Would the methodology still be appropriate?
