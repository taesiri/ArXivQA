# [Dietary Assessment with Multimodal ChatGPT: A Systematic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08592)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates the capabilities of the multimodal ChatGPT model, specifically GPT-4V, for dietary assessment and nutritional analysis. Without specific fine-tuning, GPT-4V demonstrates remarkable accuracy in food detection and recognition up to 87.5%. The model is able to accurately identify common food items as well as culturally specific regional dishes when provided contextual prompts about food origin. Additionally, GPT-4V effectively utilizes surrounding objects as scale references to estimate portion sizes, showcasing capabilities comparable to human-level accuracy with mean absolute error of 54.6g. The model can then accurately convert estimated portion sizes into nutrient data for components like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. Comparisons with ground truth data from weighed food records and the USDA National Nutrient Database illustrate strong correlations. The study highlights GPT-4V's potential to advance nutritional science, enhance dietary assessment techniques personalized to cultural contexts, and transform methodologies for nutrient-level analysis of meals. Limitations are also discussed regarding spatial analysis and volume estimation. Overall, this investigation reveals promising capabilities of multimodal foundation models in revolutionizing dietary assessment through their generalist intelligence applied across visual, textual, and nutritional data.
