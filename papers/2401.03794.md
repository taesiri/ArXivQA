# ["Oh, Sorry, I Think I Interrupted You'': Designing Repair Strategies for   Robotic Longitudinal Well-being Coaching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Robots make mistakes during human-robot interactions, especially in complex social interactions like coaching. Designing effective repair strategies when robots make mistakes is crucial for successful interactions, but has not been well studied for longitudinal well-being coaching contexts. Past work has limitations such as focusing only on one-off lab studies with game/task scenarios. 

Solution and Contributions:
This paper presents a 4-phase design process to design repair strategies for robotic longitudinal well-being coaches with real-world stakeholders:

1) Designed repair strategies (empathic and non-empathic) with a professional coach, utilizing their expertise. 

2) 4-week user study comparing empathic and non-empathic repair strategies. Showed users have varied opinions, with preferences dependent on factors like technological experience.

3) Design workshop with users to gather perspectives on appropriateness of repair strategies for different scenarios. Developed insights on when to repair vs not, use empathic repairs, technical explanations, instructions, etc.

4) Reflected on user study and workshop results with the professional coach. Showed strategies cannot be solely based on human coaching strategies; repairs not always necessary; importance of adapting to user preferences; and role of explanations/instructions.

Key contributions:
- Designing repairs appropriate for robotic well-being coaching 
- Investigating longitudinal effects of repair strategies
- Collecting real-world user perspectives on robot mistakes/repairs over time
- Involving stakeholders (coach & users) to refine repair strategies for robotic coaching

The 4-phase process and insights contribute towards deployment of capable and adaptive longitudinal robotic coaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a 4-phase design process to design repair strategies for robotic longitudinal well-being coaching involving real-world stakeholders like users and coaches, finding that robot repair strategies should acknowledge limited robot capabilities compared to humans, utilize explanations and instructions, adapt to user preferences, and reduce repetitive repairs over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the conclusions section, the main contribution of this paper is providing insights for designing repair strategies for longitudinal robotic well-being coaching, informed by perspectives from real-world users and a professional coach. Specifically, the paper:

1) Conducts a 4-phase design process involving discussions with a professional coach to design empathic and non-empathic repair strategies, a user study comparing these strategies, a design workshop with users to get their perspectives, and finally a discussion with the professional coach again to reflect on the user insights. 

2) Contributes insights for when repairs are necessary or not, when empathic repairs are appropriate, when technical explanations should be provided, and when instructions on use are helpful. 

3) Shows the importance of getting feedback from real-world stakeholders (both users and domain experts) when intuitions of the researchers/designers are not confirmed, in order to better understand how robots are experienced.

4) Provides future research directions on adapting repairs based on user feedback, developing robot awareness of errors, reducing interaction latency, and examining the timing of repairs.

In summary, the main contribution is providing insights and a research process for designing repair strategies in longitudinal robotic well-being coaching, with perspectives from real users and coaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper conducts a 4-phase design process to design repair strategies for a robotic coach. Could you expand more on why this iterative, participatory design approach was chosen and its benefits over other possible approaches? 

2. In Phase 1, empathic and non-empathic repair strategies were defined through discussions with a professional coach. What other considerations went into formulating these specific repair strategies beyond just empathy?

3. The between-subjects study design in Phase 2 compares empathic and non-empathic repairs. What are some limitations of this approach and how might a within-subjects study have provided additional insights?  

4. The paper mentions detecting behavioral signals from users to determine if repairs are still necessary over time. What kinds of behavioral signals might be useful for this and how could they be measured?

5. Phase 3 involved a design workshop with users. In what ways did this participatory approach allow you to gain insights that would not have emerged from the Phase 2 study alone?

6. The paper discusses adapting the empathy level in repairs based on user feedback during the repair. What machine learning methods might allow such real-time adaptation?

7. For technical explanations, the paper mentions developing robot awareness of mistakes. What components are needed to enable a robot to have awareness of its own mistakes?  

8. The coach compares instructions on use to a human coach adapting their speech volume for a client with hearing loss. How else is this human-robot adaptation analogy limited?

9. Repetitive repairs are noted to have a detrimental effect over time in Phase 4. How might the timing and pacing of repairs also play a role in this detrimental effect?  

10. The critical look section mentions examining intentional mistakes and timing. What other experimental elements could be further analyzed critically regarding their impact on perceptions of repairs?
