# [TC-DiffRecon: Texture coordination MRI reconstruction method based on   diffusion model and modified MF-UNet method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11274)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- MRI images often suffer from artifacts due to long acquisition times. Undersampling k-space accelerates MRI but causes aliasing artifacts. 
- Existing deep learning MRI reconstruction methods have issues:
  - Diffusion models disrupt image coherence and cause fragmentation.
  - Models suffer from oversmoothing and poor generalization across acceleration factors.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose TC-DiffRecon - a diffusion model based MRI reconstruction method that works across acceleration factors.

Key Contributions:
- Multi-Free UNet (MF-UNet) module that dynamically balances feature contributions to enhance denoising while preventing oversmoothing.
- Texture Coordination K-Space Guidance (TCKG) module that performs data consistency in k-space while coordinating image texture to prevent fragmentation.
- Coarse-to-Fine sampling scheme that speeds up sampling and reduces texture incoherence.

Results:
- Evaluated on FastMRI dataset with acceleration factors of 4x, 6x, 8x and 10x.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and generalization across factors.
- Ablations validate contributions of MF-UNet and TCKG modules.

Conclusion:
- Proposed TC-DiffRecon enables high quality MRI reconstruction that generalizes across acceleration factors, overcoming issues with image coherence and oversmoothing in prior diffusion model approaches.
