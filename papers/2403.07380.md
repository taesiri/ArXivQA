## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Image deraining aims to remove rain streaks from images captured in rainy conditions. This is an important task as the presence of rain can negatively impact subsequent computer vision tasks. Prior convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have limitations in capturing global context. While transformer-based approaches have shown improvements, they tend to distort high-frequency image details that are important for fidelity. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Gabor-guided transformer (Gabformer) for single image deraining. The key ideas are:

1) Incorporate information from a multi-scale Gabor filter into the query vectors of the transformer to guide attention to focus more on local high-frequency texture details in the image. 

2) The Gabor filter provides robustness to noise which is imparted to the transformer via the query vectors, improving its ability to handle real-world conditions.

3) Use a cross-channel self-attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity.

4) Introduce a gated feed-forward network (GFFN) module to filter less useful high-frequency information extracted by the Gabor filter.

Main Contributions:
- Novel architecture design that integrates properties of Gabor filters into a transformer via the query vectors to enhance attention on local texture features important for image fidelity.

- Improved robustness of the model to handle noise and subtle image changes by leveraging inherent Gabor filter properties.

- Reduced computational complexity via cross-channel self-attention.

- Introduced GFFN gating module to filter unimportant high-frequency information.

- Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in removing rain streaks. Both quantitative metrics and visual results are improved.
