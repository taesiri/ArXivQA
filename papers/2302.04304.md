# [Q-Diffusion: Quantizing Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively quantize diffusion models to lower precision weights and activations in order to accelerate the inference speed. 

The key hypotheses are:

1) The changing output distributions of the noise estimation model across time steps and the unique UNet architecture with shortcut connections present novel challenges for quantizing diffusion models compared to other models like CNNs.

2) Addressing these challenges by using time step-aware calibration and split shortcut quantization can enable aggressive quantization of diffusion models down to 4-bits without significant performance degradation.

Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

- Sampling calibration data from all time steps is necessary to capture the varying activations distributions. 

- Splitting quantization of shortcuts is needed to handle their abnormal activation/weight distributions.

- With these techniques, diffusion models can be quantized to very low precision like 4-bit weights and activations without much fidelity loss.

The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses by quantizing different diffusion models and showing they can maintain comparable image generation quality to full precision versions when using the proposed techniques.
