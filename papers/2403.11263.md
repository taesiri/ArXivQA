# [Stylized Face Sketch Extraction via Generative Prior with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11263)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Facial sketches can convey identity and artistic style, but generating high-quality sketches requires large datasets which are difficult to obtain.  
- Existing sketch extraction methods rely on large datasets or produce low-resolution, noisy results. Domain adaptation methods enable training with few images but cause artifacts like color bleeding or mode collapse.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose StyleSketch, a novel method to extract high-resolution artistic facial sketches after training on just 16 image pairs.  
- StyleSketch utilizes deep features from a pretrained StyleGAN face model, which contain rich semantic information. These features are input to a sketch generator network.
- The sketch generator fuses StyleGAN features across multiple scales using a deep fusion module and spatial attention. Adversarial training and losses tailored for sketch style provide supervision.

Contributions:
- Propose StyleSketch method to extract high-quality 1024x1024 artistic face sketches using just 16 training pairs, outperforming baselines.
- Introduce a deep fusion module and two-stage training approach for fast convergence when training the sketch generator.
- Demonstrate sketch editing and face image reconstruction applications enabled by StyleSketch.
- Construct a new facial sketch dataset, SKSF-A, containing 938 1024x1024 images in 7 unique styles to benchmark performance.

In summary, the key innovation is effectively utilizing StyleGAN's strong face prior through deep features to overcome the need for large paired datasets when extracting artistic face sketches. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments validate StyleSketch's ability to produce quality results with limited data.
