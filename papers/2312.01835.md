# [Few Clicks Suffice: Active Test-Time Adaptation for Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01835)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new test-time adaptation framework called Active Test-time Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (ATASeg), which allows incorporating very few manual annotations (e.g. 1-16 pixels) during inference to boost model adaptation. The framework consists of two components: a model adapter that makes predictions and adapts the model using limited labels, and a label annotator that actively selects the most valuable pixels to annotate based on informativeness. Experiments on adverse weather and corruption datasets demonstrate that with just single-pixel annotation, ATASeg significantly outperforms prior test-time adaptation methods by 2-3% mIoU, establishing comparable performance to supervised counterparts. The simple yet effective design makes ATASeg compatible with more advanced model adapters and label annotators. Results prove annotating a few pixels effectively addresses the dilemma of error accumulation and determining trainable parameters in conventional test-time adaptation, providing an economic solution for applications demanding efficiency and accuracy.
