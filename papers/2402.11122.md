# [Navigating the Dual Facets: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Sequential   Memory Editing in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11122)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Prior research on memory editing (ME) methods for large language models (LLMs) has two main limitations: (1) Models are evaluated on a per-edit basis rather than in continuous, sequential editing scenarios. (2) Evaluations have focused narrowly on basic factual knowledge, overlooking impacts on broader LLM capabilities like reasoning and language understanding.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation across both parameter-modifying and parameter-preserving ME methods to assess their impacts on six core LLM capabilities (professional knowledge, common sense, reasoning, reading comprehension, multilingual skills, code generation) under sequential editing. Four ME methods were tested across three LLaMA model sizes.

Key Findings:
- Parameter-modifying ME methods (MEND, ROME, MEMIT) systematically damage LLM performance across tasks after just 10-20 sequential edits.  
- The parameter-preserving ME method GRACE maintains capabilities after 100 edits but struggles with generalization to edited knowledge presented differently.
- Strategies like larger models, instruction tuning, editing deeper layers, and increased edit batch size help mitigate but do not eliminate declines from parameter-modifying methods.
- Analysis shows parameter divergence between edited and original layers is the primary cause of performance declines. Language modeling capability and in-context learning are also impacted.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive LLM evaluation under continuous, sequential ME across diverse capabilities and methods
- Demonstration of significant trade-offs between parameter-modifying vs. preserving ME methods  
- Analysis explaining how sequential editing disrupts parameters, language modeling, and in-context learning
- Strategies identified to potentially mitigate harmful edits, guiding future ME method development

The paper provides pivotal insights into if, how, why and when memory editing influences fundamental LLM capabilities over continuous editing. This understandings helps guide proper application of ME methods.
