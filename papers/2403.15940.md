# [Geotokens and Geotransformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers like BERT don't inherently capture sequence order/position information due to their parallel processing nature. The original transformer paper proposed position encodings to provide a sense of sequence, but there is room for improvement.
- Existing position encoding techniques are designed for natural language sequences where order matters most. They don't translate well to encode geographical coordinates where spatial relations are more important than order.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "geotokens" - input components for transformers, each linked to a specific geographic location/coordinates.
- Design a position encoding approach called "Spherical Position Encoding" that is adapted from Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). It uses rotation matrices based on longitude/latitude to represent relative positions of geotokens.

Key Details:
- Geotoken: a transformer input component representing a geographical element like a landmark. Encodes spatial attributes and pre-embedded vector capturing semantics.
- Geotransformer: a transformer tailored for geotokens instead of textual tokens.
- Spherical Position Encoding: Extends RoPE to 3D space. Uses rotation matrix based on longitude/latitude to encode relative positions of geotokens.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of geotoken and geotransformer - first transformer architecture designed for geographic data
- Spherical position encoding - novel way to encode relative positions of geotokens based on longitude/latitude
- Demonstrates improved training of geotransformer using proposed encoding vs random encoding

The key novelty is developing the first transformer tailored for geographic data via geotokens and spherical position encoding. Early results validate the approach can help model spatial relationships between geotokens.
