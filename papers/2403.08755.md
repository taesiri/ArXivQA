# [DAM: Dynamic Adapter Merging for Continual Video QA Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08755)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on the problem of continual video question answering (VidQA). Modern VidQA models are trained on static datasets and cannot adapt to distribution shifts from continually arriving new video datasets spanning different domains or capturing temporal shifts. Finetuning the models on new datasets leads to catastrophic forgetting of previous knowledge. Retraining on combined old and new data is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the need for continual VidQA learning frameworks that can efficiently adapt VidQA models to handle such domain-incremental shifts.

Proposed Solution - \Modelname:
The paper proposes a Dynamic Adapter Merging (\Modelname) framework for continual VidQA. It consists of four main components: (1) A frozen pretrained video-language backbone model (2) Dataset-specific adapters, trained sequentially on arriving datasets (3) A non-parametric router function to estimate adapter relevance for a given input (4) A dynamic adapter merging module to aggregate parameters of multiple adapters tailored to each test sample.

During training, a dataset-specific adapter is trained for each new dataset while freezing previous adapters and backbone. During inference, the router predicts relevance probabilities for selecting each adapter. Then, instead of choosing one adapter, the proposed composer dynamically merges parameters of multiple adapters tailored specifically for each test sample input. This makes the predictions robust to inaccurate router estimations and enables knowledge sharing.

Main Contributions:
1. A new highly parameter-efficient Dynamic Adapter Merging scheme for continual VidQA achieving state-of-the-art performance. 
2. Extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in mitigating forgetting and facilitating knowledge sharing by dynamic adapter merging.
3. Analyses elucidating when adapter merging is most impactful based on router accuracy and domain gaps.
4. Generalizable framework extensible to diverse continual learning scenarios like image QA and classification.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions towards continually adapting VQA models to domain distribution shifts in streaming data by proposing dynamic adapter merging as an efficient and robust solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a parameter-efficient method called Dynamic Adapter Merging that enables video question answering models to continually learn from sequentially arriving datasets spanning different domains, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a parameter-efficient method called Dynamic Adapter Merging (DAM) for continual video question-answering (VidQA) learning. Specifically:

1) DAM uses dynamic adapter merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, enable efficient adaptation to continually arriving datasets, handle inputs from unknown datasets during inference, and enable knowledge sharing across similar dataset domains. 

2) Given a set of continually streaming VidQA datasets, DAM sequentially trains dataset-specific adapters for each dataset while freezing the parameters of a large pretrained video-language backbone. 

3) During inference, DAM uses a proposed non-parametric router function to compute relevance probabilities for each adapter. It then aggregates all the adapter weights into a new adapter instance tailored for the test sample to make the final VidQA prediction.

4) DAM outperforms prior state-of-the-art continual learning approaches by 9.1% on 6 VidQA datasets spanning various domains.

5) DAM can also be easily extended to continual learning on other tasks like image classification and image QA, outperforming existing methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Dynamic Adapter Merging (DAM) method for parameter-efficient and high-performing continual VidQA learning that mitigates forgetting, enables adaptation, handles unknown datasets, and shares knowledge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Continual learning - The paper focuses on the problem of continual or lifelong learning, where models need to learn from a stream of data distributions without catastrophic forgetting.

- Domain-incremental learning (DIL) - A sub-problem of continual learning dealing with handling shifts in data distributions across domains in the streaming setting.

- Video question answering (VidQA) - The paper focuses on applying continual learning techniques to the video question answering task, where the model needs to adapt to shifts across video domains over time.  

- Dynamic adapter merging - The key technique proposed in the paper to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, handle distribution shifts, and facilitate cross-domain knowledge sharing via dynamically merging dataset-specific adapter modules.

- Router function - A component used in many prior DIL works and this paper to predict the relevance of the dataset-specific modules for a given test input from an unknown domain or distribution.  

- Knowledge sharing - The ability for the model to leverage knowledge across datasets/domains, which is facilitated through the proposed dynamic adapter merging scheme.

- Catastrophic forgetting - The phenomenon where neural networks forget previously learned knowledge upon learning new distributions, which continual learning aims to overcome.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a dynamic adapter merging scheme. Can you explain in detail how this scheme works and how it is different from prior model merging techniques? What are the key advantages?

2. The paper evaluates the proposed method on continual video question answering. Can you discuss the unique challenges that continual learning poses in the video domain compared to images? How does the method aim to address these?  

3. The paper argues that the proposed method enhances robustness to incorrect router predictions. Can you analyze the results in Table 2 and Figure 3 to provide evidence supporting or contradicting this claim?

4. The continual initialization scheme is reported to bring performance improvements. What is this scheme and what is the intuition behind why it helps? Can you cite any theoretical or empirical evidence?

5. The paper experimented with both large and small domain gaps between datasets. Compare and contrast the results in Tables 4 and 5. What do these results indicate about the method's abilities?

6. While model merging has been explored before, a key distinction is that this method produces a model tailored to each test sample. Analyze the results in Table 3 to evaluate the significance of this distinction. 

7. The paper explored generalizability to both images and other continual learning scenarios. Summarize these experiments and discuss what they reveal about the flexibility of the approach.

8. The method relies heavily on the router component. In Section 5.2, different router designs are analyzed. Summarize this analysis - what are the key takeaways regarding router function design?

9. The paper argues the method enables knowledge sharing across domains. But the extent of sharing seems intrinsically connected to the router accuracy. Critically analyze whether the current method sufficiently facilitates cross-domain transfer given imperfect router predictions. 

10. The method exhibits clear performance gains over prior arts. But analyzing the gap to the multi-task upper bound reveals substantial room for improvement still exists. Enumerate the key limitations of the current method and discuss promising future work directions that could help bridge this gap further.
