# [What Text Design Characterizes Book Genres?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper aims to analyze the relationship between text designs (e.g. font style, character color, etc.) printed on book covers and the book genres. Specifically, it tries to answer two research questions: (1) How effective is text design in determining book genres compared to semantic information? (2) What text design characterizes book genres?

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a hierarchical transformer model to classify book covers into genres based on semantic features from the printed words as well as text design features like font style, character color, background color, text height and text position. By comparing classification performance with and without text designs, and analyzing confusion matrices, they evaluate the effectiveness of text designs. They also visualize attention weights to understand which designs characterize certain genres. 

Main Contributions:
- Show that while semantic features are sufficient for genre classification, incorporating text designs can provide a slight boost in performance (+3% top-1 accuracy)
- Identify correlations between specific text designs and certain genres, e.g. font style helps classify "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", character color helps classify "Christian Books & Bibles"
- Provide examples of how different genres tend to use different text designs, e.g. condensed fonts for mystery books, light background colors for children's books

In summary, this paper demonstrates that while semantic information plays a major role, incorporating knowledge of how text designs correlate with genres can help boost performance of book genre classification. The analysis also provides insights into how graphic designers characterize certain book genres based on choices of text designs.
