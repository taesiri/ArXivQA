# Multimodal Dialogue Response Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we develop a multimodal dialogue system that can generate coherent textual responses or high-resolution image responses, in a low-resource setting where only limited multimodal dialog data is available for training?The key hypothesis is that by disentangling the textual response generation and image response generation components, and pre-training them on large amounts of text-only dialogues and text-image pairs respectively, the model can learn effectively from only a small number of multimodal dialog examples during joint fine-tuning.In summary, the paper proposes a novel conversational agent called Divter to tackle the challenges of multimodal dialogue response generation under low-resource conditions, by leveraging pre-trained text dialogue and text-to-image models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new task - multimodal dialogue response generation (MDRG), where the model needs to generate either a text response or an image response given the dialogue context. 2. It explores this task under a low-resource setting, where only limited training examples of multimodal dialogues are available. This is a practical scenario as collecting large-scale multimodal dialogues is difficult.3. It presents a novel conversational agent called Divter to tackle the challenges of the proposed low-resource MDRG task. Divter consists of two components: a textual dialogue response generator and a text-to-image translator. 4. The key idea is to make the parameters relying on multimodal dialogues small and independent, so that the major components can be pre-trained on large amounts of text-only dialogues and text-image pairs respectively. This reduces the dependence on the scarce multimodal dialogues.5. Extensive experiments show Divter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both automatic metrics and human evaluation, demonstrating its ability to generate informative textual and high-resolution image responses.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the low-resource MDRG task and an effective agent Divter to tackle this practical challenge through pre-training and transfer learning. The results demonstrate the feasibility of multimodal response generation with limited training data.
