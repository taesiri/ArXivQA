Overall, the broad scope, conceptual framing, future outlook, and applications orientation differentiate this paper from prior comparative work and serve to synthesize the current state of negotiation dialogue research in a structured, forward-looking manner. It provides a nice reference point for where the field stands today and where it should aim to go.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Multi-modal negotiation dialogue: The authors suggest incorporating non-verbal cues like facial expressions and emotions into the negotiation process, as humans tend to perceive information in a multi-modal way. 

- Multi-party negotiation dialogue: The paper notes that most current work focuses on two-party negotiation. The authors suggest collecting dialogues and developing methods for more complex multi-party scenarios like team negotiations or negotiations with multiple stakeholders.

- Cross-culture and multi-lingual negotiation: Existing benchmarks focus on English, so the authors recommend incorporating diverse languages and social/cultural norms into negotiation dialogue systems to better reflect real-world diversity.

- Negotiation in real-world scenarios: Many current benchmarks use crowd-sourced role-playing dialogues. The authors suggest collecting real dialogues from scenarios like business meetings or political negotiations to better capture authentic negotiation behaviors.  

- Addressing limited resources: The authors note resource scarcity hinders negotiation dialogue research and suggest developing methods like data augmentation, transfer learning, and leveraging unlabeled data to make the most of limited labeled negotiation data.

In summary, the main future directions highlighted are moving beyond simple two-party English language scenarios, collecting real unlabeled negotiation data, and developing methods to learn effectively from limited labeled data. The overarching emphasis seems to be on improving the authenticity and complexity of negotiation dialogues to advance research.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Let's Negotiate! A Survey of Negotiation Dialogue Systems":

The paper provides a survey of negotiation dialogue systems, which aim to enable AI agents to engage in natural language negotiations with humans. The authors categorize existing methods into three main areas: strategy modeling, personality modeling, and policy learning. For strategy modeling, they discuss methods for modeling integrative/win-win, distributive/win-loss, and multi-party negotiation strategies. Personality modeling encompasses mind modeling (e.g. preference estimation), emotion modeling, and behavior modeling to understand the psychology and behaviors of negotiators. Finally, for policy learning, they review reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and multi-task learning approaches that allow agents to choose negotiation strategies and generate utterances. Overall, the survey provides a structured overview of techniques for enabling AI agents to perform complex reasoning, leverage psychology factors, and effectively use language during negotiations with humans.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues" is addressing the challenge of building negotiation dialogue systems that can have natural conversations to reach agreement on issues like pricing. Specifically, it aims to decouple the strategy aspect of the conversation (deciding what to say) from the generation aspect (determining the actual wording). 

Some key points:

- Negotiation dialogues require strategic reasoning to decide what actions to take (making offers, asking for information, etc.) as well as natural language generation to translate those actions into fluent utterances. 

- Prior work had tried to optimize negotiation agents end-to-end but it is difficult to learn both strategic reasoning and fluent language skills together.

- This paper proposes to break the problem down by having separate modules for strategy and generation. A "dialog manager" decides the high-level action for each turn, then a "language generator" converts that into a natural language utterance.

- They collected a dataset of human-human negotiations on Craigslist to train and evaluate the model.

- By decoupling strategy and generation, they can optimize each part separately. The dialog manager can be optimized for negotiation outcomes while the generator can be optimized for fluency.

In summary, the key question is how to build agents that can negotiate via natural language dialogues, which requires both strategic planning and language skills. Their approach tries to simplify the problem by separating those two aspects into modular components.
