# Let's Negotiate! A Survey of Negotiation Dialogue Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research focus of this paper is on negotiation dialogue systems. Specifically, the authors aim to provide a systematic review of the emerging field of negotiation dialogue systems, covering aspects such as benchmarks, evaluation, methodology, and future directions. The key research questions and goals addressed in this paper are:- What are the existing datasets and benchmarks available for training and evaluating negotiation dialogue systems? The paper provides an overview and categorization of current negotiation dialogue datasets based on negotiation types like integrative vs. distributive.- How can we evaluate the performance of negotiation dialogue systems? The paper summarizes goal-based metrics, game-based metrics, and human evaluations used for assessing negotiation agents.- What are the main modeling challenges and how can we categorize existing solutions? The paper discusses key challenges in strategy modeling, personality modeling, and policy learning for negotiation agents. - What are promising future directions to make negotiation dialogue systems more practical? The paper suggests avenues like multi-modal dialogues, multi-party negotiations, cross-cultural dialogues, and collecting real-world negotiation data.In summary, this paper aims to provide the first systematic literature review of the emerging field of negotiation dialogue systems, summarize the current progress, challenges, and suggest future opportunities in this space. The review covers the research questions around datasets, evaluation, modeling methods, and new directions to advance negotiation dialogue research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here is a summary of the main contribution of the paper:The paper presents a survey of negotiation dialogue systems, providing a systematic review of research in this emerging field. The key contributions are:1. It categorizes current negotiation dialogue benchmarks based on the negotiation type (distributive vs. integrative). It provides an overview of major datasets for negotiating scenarios like bargaining, games, job interviews, etc.2. It summarizes typical evaluation methods used for negotiation dialogue systems, including goal-based metrics, game-based metrics, and human evaluation. A table lists specific metrics used in existing work.3. It categorizes methodology into strategy modeling, personality modeling, and policy learning. It reviews methods proposed for modeling negotiation strategies, opponent preferences and behaviors, and policy learning frameworks like reinforcement learning. 4. It discusses new frontiers and challenges, such as collecting real-world negotiation dialogues, and exploring multi-modal, multi-party, cross-cultural negotiation scenarios.In summary, the paper provides a systematic categorization and review of datasets, evaluations, methods, and open challenges for the field of negotiation dialogue systems. It offers the research community an overview of the state-of-the-art and potential future directions in this space.
