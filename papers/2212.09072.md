Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a survey of negotiation dialogue systems, covering benchmarks, evaluations, methodologies, and potential future directions like multi-modal, multi-party, and cross-cultural negotiation scenarios.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on negotiation dialogue systems compares to other research in the field:- Scope and Comprehensiveness: This paper aims to provide a broad, comprehensive overview of the current state of research on negotiation dialogue systems. It reviews benchmarks, evaluations, and methods across the literature. Many other papers focus more narrowly on proposing a new model or dataset. The broad scope makes this more of a survey paper.- Categorization Framework: The paper systematically categorizes existing work into integrative vs. distributive negotiation types, and also uses the taxonomy of strategy modeling, personality modeling, and policy learning methods. This provides a conceptual framework to organize the disparate research efforts. Other comparative papers often lack an explicit categorization system.- Future Outlook: The paper concludes by identifying open challenges and promising future directions like multi-party dialogues. It takes a forward-looking stance that speculates on where the field should head next. In contrast, most research papers only briefly mention limitations and future work as an afterthought. - Emphasis on Applications: This survey highlights real-world applications and scenarios where negotiation dialog systems could provide value, such as bargaining, persuasion, and privacy protection. The applicability and impact are front and center. Other papers tend to have a more narrow academic focus.Overall, the broad scope, conceptual framing, future outlook, and applications orientation differentiate this paper from prior comparative work and serve to synthesize the current state of negotiation dialogue research in a structured, forward-looking manner. It provides a nice reference point for where the field stands today and where it should aim to go.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Multi-modal negotiation dialogue: The authors suggest incorporating non-verbal cues like facial expressions and emotions into the negotiation process, as humans tend to perceive information in a multi-modal way. - Multi-party negotiation dialogue: The paper notes that most current work focuses on two-party negotiation. The authors suggest collecting dialogues and developing methods for more complex multi-party scenarios like team negotiations or negotiations with multiple stakeholders.- Cross-culture and multi-lingual negotiation: Existing benchmarks focus on English, so the authors recommend incorporating diverse languages and social/cultural norms into negotiation dialogue systems to better reflect real-world diversity.- Negotiation in real-world scenarios: Many current benchmarks use crowd-sourced role-playing dialogues. The authors suggest collecting real dialogues from scenarios like business meetings or political negotiations to better capture authentic negotiation behaviors.  - Addressing limited resources: The authors note resource scarcity hinders negotiation dialogue research and suggest developing methods like data augmentation, transfer learning, and leveraging unlabeled data to make the most of limited labeled negotiation data.In summary, the main future directions highlighted are moving beyond simple two-party English language scenarios, collecting real unlabeled negotiation data, and developing methods to learn effectively from limited labeled data. The overarching emphasis seems to be on improving the authenticity and complexity of negotiation dialogues to advance research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents the first systematic review of the emerging field of negotiation dialogue systems. The authors review contemporary work on negotiation dialogue systems, covering benchmarks, evaluations, and methodologies. They categorize existing benchmarks based on negotiation types - integrative vs. distributive. They also organize current solutions into three main areas - personality modeling, strategy modeling, and policy learning. Personality modeling helps understand negotiators' preferences, strategy modeling enables reasonable decisions, and policy learning methods utilize information effectively. The authors point out limitations of existing work, which mostly focuses on English, two-party dialogues collected via crowdsourcing. They suggest promising future directions including multi-modal, multi-party, cross-cultural, and real-world scenario negotiations. Overall, this survey provides a structured overview of the state of negotiation dialogue systems research and opportunities for advancing the field.
