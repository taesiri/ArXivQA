# [CoMoSpeech: One-Step Speech and Singing Voice Synthesis via Consistency   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06908)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a fast and high-quality text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis model using the consistency model?The key points are:- Diffusion models like DDPMs can generate high-quality speech but are slow due to requiring many sampling steps. Finding a way to achieve fast sampling while maintaining quality is a key challenge.- The consistency model has been shown to allow fast sampling in image synthesis, but has not been explored for speech. This paper aims to develop a consistency model for fast, high-quality speech synthesis.- The proposed CoMoSpeech method distills a consistency model from a well-designed diffusion-based teacher model. This allows one-step sampling while achieving audio quality on par with or better than multi-step diffusion models.- Experiments on both text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis tasks demonstrate CoMoSpeech can generate speech over 150x faster than real-time while achieving state-of-the-art audio quality.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that leveraging the consistency model can enable fast yet high-quality speech synthesis compared to previous diffusion-based methods. The results seem to validate this hypothesis.
