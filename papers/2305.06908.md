# [CoMoSpeech: One-Step Speech and Singing Voice Synthesis via Consistency   Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06908)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a fast and high-quality text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis model using the consistency model?The key points are:- Diffusion models like DDPMs can generate high-quality speech but are slow due to requiring many sampling steps. Finding a way to achieve fast sampling while maintaining quality is a key challenge.- The consistency model has been shown to allow fast sampling in image synthesis, but has not been explored for speech. This paper aims to develop a consistency model for fast, high-quality speech synthesis.- The proposed CoMoSpeech method distills a consistency model from a well-designed diffusion-based teacher model. This allows one-step sampling while achieving audio quality on par with or better than multi-step diffusion models.- Experiments on both text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis tasks demonstrate CoMoSpeech can generate speech over 150x faster than real-time while achieving state-of-the-art audio quality.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that leveraging the consistency model can enable fast yet high-quality speech synthesis compared to previous diffusion-based methods. The results seem to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes CoMoSpeech, a consistency model-based method for fast and high-quality speech and singing voice synthesis. 2. It designs a diffusion-based teacher model that transforms mel-spectrogram to Gaussian noise distribution and learns the corresponding score function.3. It distills the multi-step sampling process of the teacher model into a one-step process in CoMoSpeech using consistency constraint.4. Experiments on both text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis tasks show that CoMoSpeech achieves over 150x real-time speed while maintaining high audio quality comparable or better than other multi-step diffusion models.5. CoMoSpeech demonstrates the potential of achieving both fast inference speed and high audio quality for diffusion model-based speech synthesis.In summary, the key contribution is the propose of CoMoSpeech, which achieves fast yet high-quality speech synthesis by applying consistency constraint to distill a diffusion-based teacher model. This makes diffusion model truly practical for speech synthesis applications requiring real-time speed.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes CoMoSpeech, a consistency model-based method for fast and high-quality text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis, which can generate high-quality audio with only a single sampling step by distilling a consistency model from a well-designed diffusion-based teacher model.
