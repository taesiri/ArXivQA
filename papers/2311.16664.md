# [DGNR: Density-Guided Neural Point Rendering of Large Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16664)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel framework called DGNR (Density-Guided Neural Rendering) for efficiently synthesizing photorealistic novel views of large-scale driving scenes with long trajectories. Unlike existing methods that rely on spatial warping, geometric supervision, or scene division with multiple neural radiance fields, DGNR introduces a learnable density space to intrinsically construct scene geometry through volumetric rendering without needing explicit depth supervision. Specifically, a differentiable renderer synthesizes images by projecting the density space into 2D neural density features. To enhance accuracy, they divide the scene into blocks and fuse them using a density-based module while applying geometric regularization. Experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate DGNR's state-of-the-art performance in realistically rendering urban driving views at real-time capable speeds. The compact scene representation and efficient neural rendering process addresses key limitations of current approaches. DGNR advances the capability for high-fidelity synthesis of large-scale street scenes without reliance on additional sensor data.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called DGNR (Density-Guided Neural Rendering) for synthesizing photorealistic novel views of large-scale driving scenes. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a density-guided scene representation to compactly encode scenes using explicit representation, enabling the construction of large-scale driving scenes without relying on geometric priors.
