# [Focus On Details: Online Multi-object Tracking with Diverse Fine-grained   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14589)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve multi-object tracking performance by using more fine-grained and diverse appearance representations of targets, rather than coarse global representations? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Fine-grained global and local appearance representations can complement each other to more comprehensively describe a target's identity, especially when the target is occluded.

2) High resolution feature maps with precise semantic information are needed as a basis for generating these diverse fine-grained representations. 

3) Learning to align and aggregate multi-scale feature maps can produce these high-res semantically precise feature maps.

4) Focusing on different parts of targets through parallel attention branches can generate fine-grained part representations without label supervision.

5) Balancing positive and negative training samples through grouped shuffling can improve convergence and performance.

So in summary, the central research thrust seems to be improving MOT performance by going beyond coarse global appearance features to diverse, fine-grained, global and local representations of targets. The paper proposes techniques to enable and enhance this fine-grained representation.
