# [Kick Back &amp; Relax++: Scaling Beyond Ground-Truth Depth with SlowTV &amp;   CribsTV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) models rely exclusively on automotive datasets and fail to generalize beyond this restricted domain. This is due to the lack of diversity in current datasets.

- Supervised approaches require expensive ground-truth depth data. In contrast, SS-MDE only needs unlabeled video, but has been limited by small-scale datasets.

Methodology:
- The paper introduces two new large-scale datasets called SlowTV (1.7M frames) and CribsTV (330K frames) collected from YouTube videos. These feature incredibly diverse environments like forests, mountain roads, underwater caves and luxury homes.

- The proposed Kick Back & Relax (KBR) framework is trained on these datasets. Additional components are introduced to further improve generalization like learning camera intrinsics, aggressive data augmentation, flexible motion estimation and modern network backbones.

Results: 
- In zero-shot evaluations, KBR significantly outperforms all existing SS-MDE methods, and even matches some supervised state-of-the-art models, despite using no ground-truth supervision.

- An updated KBR++ incorporates additional indoor data from CribsTV and a transformer backbone. It demonstrates the capabilities of SS-MDE by closing the gap to top-performing supervised techniques.

- Qualitative results showcase the high quality of predictions on diverse unseen environments. The models are also applied to a real-world map-free relocalization pipeline.

Main Contributions:
- Two new large-scale diverse datasets for SS-MDE collected from YouTube
- State-of-the-art self-supervised depth estimation with unmatched generalization capabilities 
- Detailed ablation studies on key components that improve performance
- Closing the gap between supervised and self-supervised monocular depth estimation


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents two large-scale self-supervised monocular depth estimation datasets from YouTube videos to train models that significantly improve zero-shot generalization, matching state-of-the-art supervised methods without using any ground truth depth data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The introduction of two large-scale self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SS-MDE) datasets called SlowTV and CribsTV, curated from YouTube videos. Together they contain 2 million diverse training images.

2) Leveraging these datasets to train SS-MDE models that achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, matching or even outperforming some supervised methods. This demonstrates their ability to generalize to unseen environments.

3) A range of contributions that further improve generalization capability, including: learning camera intrinsics, aggressive data augmentation strategies, support frame randomization, flexible motion estimation, and modern network architectures. 

4) Extensive experiments and ablation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and datasets for advancing the state-of-the-art in self-supervised depth estimation.

In summary, the key contribution is the curation of diverse SS-MDE training data and techniques to train models on this data that can generalize very effectively to new environments in a zero-shot manner, without requiring ground truth depth supervision.
