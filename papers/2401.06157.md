## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Invasive signal crayfish and plastic pollution threaten native species and habitats in UK rivers. Monitoring their presence and spread is critical but challenging.
- Traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive, limited in scale, hazardous, and provide sparse data.
- A solution is needed to automate monitoring over large areas to provide accurate, real-time data on invasive species and plastic debris.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors introduce UDEEP, an AI-powered edge computing platform for automated in-situ detection of crayfish and plastics from images.
- UDEEP integrates background subtraction, selective cropping, Gaussian mixture models, and YOLOv5/YOLOv8 models.
- It runs on an Nvidia Jetson Nano edge device and Intel RealSense camera for on-site deployment.

Main Contributions:
- Development of the UDEEP platform combining multiple methods for automated underwater monitoring.
- Training and benchmarking of YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s for crayfish/plastic detection using a novel dataset.
- YOLOv8s had the best tradeoff of accuracy (91.7% precision) and efficiency (2,548mA).
- Introduction of two public datasets with over 2,000 labeled underwater images of crayfish and plastics.
- Demonstration of UDEEP's real-world viability through in-situ river testing and off-grid solar powering.

In summary, the paper presents a novel edge computing solution, models, and datasets to enable scalable, automated monitoring to address threats from invasive species and pollution in rivers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces an edge computing platform called UDEEP that integrates deep learning for the automated in-situ detection and monitoring of invasive signal crayfish and plastic debris in rivers using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models trained on two new public datasets of images captured in UK rivers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of the UDEEP (Underwater Deep learning EdgE computing Platform) for the automated detection and monitoring of invasive signal crayfish and plastic debris in rivers. Specifically:

- The UDEEP platform integrates various techniques like background subtraction and selective cropping of regions of interest in high-resolution images to detect crayfish and plastic debris. It leverages AI, IoT devices, and edge computing to provide accurate data on the presence, distribution, and density of invasive species and plastic pollution.

- The paper presents experiments conducted using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models trained on custom underwater datasets to identify crayfish and plastic with high accuracy. Performance metrics like mAP, precision, recall, and inference current consumption are reported. 

- Two new publicly available datasets are introduced - one with 2486 labeled images of crayfish and another with 1220 images of plastic debris captured in UK rivers under varying visibility conditions.

- A prototype UDEEP system using a Jetson Nano is demonstrated with sample results showing successful in-situ detection of crayfish and plastic debris.

In summary, the key innovation is the UDEEP platform for automated monitoring and quantification of environmental threats like invasive species and plastic pollution in rivers using edge AI. The paper makes the system, models, and datasets openly available to progress research in this application area.
