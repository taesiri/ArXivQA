# [Modeling Complex Mathematical Reasoning via Large Language Model based   MathAgent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08926)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called Planner-Reasoner-Executor-Reflector (PRER) to model the complex multi-step process of mathematical reasoning using large language models (LLMs). PRER decomposes the reasoning into modules of planning actions, logical inference, executing actions, and self-verification. Building on this, the authors implement two types of MathAgent systems: one aligned with model behaviors (MathAgent-M) that allows more freeform reasoning, and one aligned with human cognition (MathAgent-H) that constrains actions into logical workflows. Experiments demonstrate that both MathAgents integrated with the powerful LLM GPT-4 achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MATH and miniF2F mathematical reasoning datasets. In particular, MathAgent-H outperforms GPT-4 baseline by 9.26% on MATH and 12.3% on miniF2F, showcasing the benefits of systematically modeling reasoning chains. Ablation studies provide further insights, suggesting refined actions enable better LLM cooperation on complex tasks, while regulating LLM behaviors also improves reasoning. Overall, the proposed PRER framework and MathAgent systems present a promising direction for eliciting stronger mathematical reasoning from LLMs.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Mathematical reasoning is a complex task requiring problem recognition, associating domain knowledge, and determining reasoning schema. 
- Despite impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) on some tasks, solving complex mathematical problems remains challenging. A key issue is that LLMs struggle to accomplish all required inferences in one step, leading to confusion and errors.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes extending LLMs with agent systems to model the mathematical reasoning process, decomposing it into simpler steps. 
- A general framework "Planner-Reasoner-Executor-Reflector" (PRER) is introduced to model the reasoning process. It includes modules for task planning, logical reasoning, action execution, and self-verification.
- Two MathAgent systems implementing PRER are provided:
   - MathAgent-M: Model-aligned system with coarse-grained actions adapting to LLM behaviors. Allowed to freely select actions.
   - MathAgent-H: Human-aligned system with refined, logical actions and introduced topological structures based on human reasoning process. More constrained to emulate expert workflows.

Main Contributions:
- First to systematically decompose and model complex mathematical reasoning process by integrating LLMs with agents.
- Propose general PRER framework to model reasoning process with four key modules.  
- Implement two MathAgent systems based on PRER with different orientations: MathAgent-M is model-aligned while MathAgent-H aligns better with human reasoning.
- Experiments show MathAgents outperform baselines on complex math datasets, demonstrating effectiveness. Analysis provides insights into behaviors of LLM-based agents.

The paper makes an important contribution in eliciting the potential of LLMs for mathematical reasoning by agent-based modeling of the reasoning process. The proposed PRER framework and MathAgent systems provide a novel approach to extending LLMs' capacity for multi-step inference tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework called PRER (Planner-Reasoner-Executor-Reflector) and two math agent systems called MathAgent-M and MathAgent-H to systematically decompose and model the complex mathematical reasoning process using large language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. To the best of their knowledge, they are the first to systematically decompose and model the solving process of complex mathematical reasoning, exploring the potential of integrating the large language models (LLMs) with agents.

2. They extend the LLM-based agent to mathematical reasoning by proposing a general zero-shot PRER (Planner-Reasoner-Executor-Reflector) framework. They also provide and implement two MathAgents based on PRER.

3. Experiments demonstrated that their proposed MathAgents outperform other baselines for complex mathematical reasoning on challenging datasets like MATH and miniF2F. This depicts the promising potential of the PRER framework. Analytical results further reveal the detailed behaviors of LLM-based agents, which the authors hope will inspire future research.

In summary, the key contribution is using an agent-based framework (PRER) to model the process of complex mathematical reasoning and implementing two MathAgents that integrate LLMs to improve performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. The experiments and analysis provide insights into how to effectively exploit LLMs as mathematical reasoning agents.
