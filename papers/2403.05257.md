# [Cross-lingual Transfer or Machine Translation? On Data Augmentation for   Monolingual Semantic Textual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05257)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monolingual semantic textual similarity (STS) is important for natural language understanding but suffers from lack of labeled data in non-English languages.  
- Prior work has used English NLI datasets to train multilingual models via cross-lingual transfer or machine translation, but these techniques have not been directly compared for monolingual STS.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare cross-lingual transfer and machine translation for augmenting data for monolingual STS in Japanese and Korean using unsupervised SimCSE as the training framework.
- Evaluate on multiple STS datasets per language and analyze impact of training data domain (NLI vs Wikipedia).
- Also compare to state-of-the-art multilingual sentence encoder LaBSE.  

Key Findings:
- Cross-lingual transfer and machine translation achieve comparable performance depending on domain of training data.
- Surprisingly, Wikipedia data outperforms NLI data for monolingual STS when used in cross-lingual transfer framework.
- Cross-lingual transfer of Wikipedia data achieves best performance, outperforming or comparable to LaBSE.

Main Contributions:
- First direct comparison of cross-lingual transfer and machine translation for monolingual STS.
- Demonstrates Wikipedia data can outperform NLI data for this task. 
- Shows cross-lingual transfer of Wikipedia data exceeds performance of state-of-the-art multilingual encoder.
- Provides recipe for improving non-English STS via cross-lingual transfer learning using large-scale Wikipedia data.

In summary, the key novelty is in demonstrating the effectiveness of Wikipedia data over expected NLI data for monolingual STS via cross-lingual transfer. The results provide a simple framework for improving multilingual models for this important NLU task.
