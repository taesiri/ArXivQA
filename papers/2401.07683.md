# [Assisted Knowledge Graph Authoring: Human-Supervised Knowledge Graph   Construction from Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07683)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs encode real world knowledge and relationships, and have applications in search, QA systems, recommendations, etc. However, domain-specific knowledge graphs only exist for a few domains. Constructing specialized knowledge graphs from scratch requires significant expertise and effort.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors introduce WAKA, a web application that allows domain experts to create knowledge graphs from natural language text. 
- WAKA links entities and relations to Wikidata to leverage its ontology and entities. It also allows adding new entities/relations not in Wikidata.
- It has an intuitive interface for users to visualize, correct, extend and author an automatically constructed knowledge graph from text.

Key Contributions:
- Automatic knowledge graph construction pipeline with entity discovery, relation extraction and knowledge fusion components.
- Interactive interface with linked text editor and graph visualizer for knowledge graph authoring and validation. Allows graph manipulation, linking entities/relations to Wikidata, adding new nodes/edges.
- Downloads constructed graph in standard RDF format for use in other Semantic Web applications.
- Addresses the problem of easy domain-specific knowledge graph construction without extensive expertise. Facilitates building graphs for specialized applications.

In summary, the paper presents WAKA, a novel application to help domain experts construct specialized knowledge graphs easily through natural language supervision over an automatically created graph. This facilitates building knowledge graphs for domain-specific retrieval applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces WAKA, a web application that allows domain experts to create knowledge graphs from natural language text through an intuitive interface with automated support and human supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is the introduction of WAKA, which is a Web application that allows domain experts to create knowledge graphs from natural language text. Specifically, the key aspects of WAKA that constitute the main contribution are:

1) It provides an intuitive interface with a text editor and interactive graph visualization to supervise, correct, extend and visualize a automatically constructed knowledge graph. 

2) It links entities and relations to Wikidata to leverage its ontology and large number of entities. However, it also allows adding new entities and relations. 

3) The authored knowledge graph can be downloaded in a standard Semantic Web data format (RDF N-Triples) to be used in other applications.

4) It includes an automatic approach to construct an initial knowledge graph from unstructured text, consisting of entity discovery, relation extraction and linking, knowledge fusion and natural language inference components. However, the complexity of this task necessitates the interactive supervision through WAKA's interface.

In summary, WAKA facilitates the construction of knowledge graphs by domain experts through an intuitive interface rather than requiring expertise in knowledge representation or programming. The main novelty is in enabling and supporting this knowledge graph authoring process.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that domain-specific knowledge graphs exist only for a few domains. What are some examples of domains that still lack specialized knowledge graphs and why is constructing them manually difficult?

2. The entity discovery pipeline employs multiple named entity recognition models. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each model and why is using an ensemble beneficial? 

3. The entity retrieval ranking function takes into account both the query-document relevance score and the commonness of the entity. What is the intuition behind incorporating commonness and how is it calculated?

4. The entity reranking step computes the semantic similarity between the entity description and the source text. What embedding model is used and why was it chosen over other alternatives?

5. The relation extraction model mREBEL is a multilingual extension of REBEL. How does mREBEL improve over REBEL and what advantages does using a multilingual model provide?

6. The knowledge fusion step constructs candidate triples by taking the Cartesian product of subject and object entities. What are some challenges this approach faces and how do the subsequent steps address them? 

7. Explain the natural language inference scoring function. Why is the probability output of the BART-large-MNLI model used and what are its limitations?

8. The paper states that low performance of the overall pipeline underscores the complexity of knowledge graph construction. What are some specific challenges contributing to this complexity? 

9. The interface allows interactively supervising and correcting the constructed knowledge graph. What are the key capabilities it provides to support this and how do they address the challenges?

10. The constructed knowledge graph can be exported in RDF format. What are some potential applications of the exported knowledge graph and what extensions would be needed to support them?
