# [3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting for Occlusion Robust 3D Human Pose   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10123)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to make monocular 3D human pose estimation robust to occlusion. The key hypothesis is that by taking a generative modeling approach and performing approximate analysis-by-synthesis at the feature level, the method can become highly robust to occlusion while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance on non-occluded data. Specifically, the hypotheses are:1. A volumetric human body representation with Gaussian kernel features (Neural Body Volumes) allows efficient and robust differentiable rendering on the feature level.2. Imposing a pose-conditioned distribution on the kernel features makes them 3D-aware and helps resolve the inherent 2D-3D ambiguity in monocular 3D pose estimation. 3. An iterative process of contrastive feature learning and maximum likelihood training of the kernel features enables extracting 3D-aware features invariant to instance-specific details.4. Combining bottom-up regression with top-down neural body fitting at test time leads to occlusion robustness while remaining efficient.The key research contributions are:- Proposing Neural Body Volumes, a volumetric articulated body model for feature rendering.- Introducing 3D-aware pose-dependent kernel features. - A contrastive learning framework for training 3D-aware features.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and occlusion robustness on several 3D pose estimation benchmarks.In summary, the paper hypothesizes that by performing analysis-by-synthesis in a learned 3D-aware feature space, monocular 3D human pose estimation can be made highly robust to occlusion. The proposed method 3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) aims to validate this hypothesis.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a 3D-aware neural body fitting (3DNBF) approach for robust 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, using an analysis-by-synthesis framework with a novel volumetric neural body representation that imposes pose-dependent feature distributions to resolve 2D-3D ambiguity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D human pose estimation:- The main contribution is proposing a generative model-based approach for 3D human pose estimation that is robust to occlusions. This is different from most prior work that uses discriminative models like neural networks to directly regress the 3D pose.- Compared to other generative approaches like SMPLify, this method uses a learned deep generative model of features rather than relying on hand-designed features like 2D keypoints. The 3D-aware features help resolve the ambiguity in lifting 2D to 3D. - The volumetric body representation is more amenable to gradient-based fitting than mesh-based models used before. It also handles self-occlusions more gracefully.- The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard 3D pose estimation benchmarks like 3DPW. This demonstrates it works well for non-occluded cases too.- More importantly, it shows significantly improved robustness to occlusion compared to prior regression-based methods on occlusion datasets like 3DPW-Occ. The adversarial evaluation further supports this.- Compared to other optimization-based approaches, it shows better performance when initialized from the same regressor, indicating the learned features and volumetric formulation help optimization.- The iterative regression plus generative fitting approach balances accuracy and speed. Fitting the generative model to features helps resolve errors in the initial regression estimate.- The contrastive representation learning framework is quite standard now but is effectively adapted here to learn 3D-aware features.In summary, the key novelty is in proposing a generative model approach to harness the benefits of both regression and iterative fitting for occlusion-robust 3D human pose estimation. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both occluded and non-occluded cases.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Developing even more robust generative models for 3D human pose estimation that can handle more challenging real-world occlusion scenarios. The authors propose some adversarial evaluations like 3DPW-AdvOcc, but suggest more benchmarks and techniques could be developed.- Extending the 3D-aware neural body fitting approach to video input. The current method works on single images, but the authors suggest leveraging temporal information could further improve occlusion robustness. - Applying similar generative 3D-aware analysis-by-synthesis formulations to other vision tasks like 3D hand pose estimation or 3D object pose estimation. The core ideas could potentially generalize.- Exploring different volumetric body representations beyond the Gaussian kernels used in this work. Other types of parametric volumes may have advantages.- Improving the efficiency and speed of the optimization process during inference/testing. This could involve better initialization or approximations to make the iterative analysis-by-synthesis more scalable.- Validating the robustness to other types of perturbations besides occlusion, like challenging backgrounds, lighting changes, etc. - Combining the benefits of regression-based and optimization-based approaches into an end-to-end framework rather than using separate steps.Overall, the authors propose this is a promising research direction and suggest many ways it could be extended and improved in future work. The key ideas like analysis-by-synthesis in learned feature spaces and 3D-aware generative models seem to have a lot of potential.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a 3D-aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) framework for robust 3D human pose estimation, especially under occlusion. The key idea is to perform analysis-by-synthesis on the feature level rather than in RGB space, using a novel generative model called Neural Body Volumes (NBV). NBV represents the human body as a volume of Gaussian kernels, each associated with a pose-dependent feature vector. By imposing a distribution on these features conditioned on 3D pose, the model becomes "3D-aware", helping to resolve inherent 2D-3D ambiguities in monocular pose estimation. The features and generative model are trained jointly using a contrastive learning approach. For efficiency, a regression head predicts an initial pose. During inference, NBV is fitted to the observed features by gradient-based optimization of a likelihood objective. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on standard 3D pose benchmarks, with significant improvements in robustness under occlusion compared to previous regression and optimization-based approaches.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a 3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) framework for robust 3D human pose estimation under occlusion. The method formulates 3D pose estimation as an analysis-by-synthesis problem, where the goal is to find the 3D pose parameters that best explain the observed image features. To achieve this, the authors propose a novel generative model called Neural Body Volumes (NBV) that renders a human body into a feature map conditioned on the 3D pose and shape parameters. NBV represents the human body as a set of 3D Gaussian kernels, each associated with a pose-dependent feature vector. This allows resolving the inherent 2D-3D ambiguity in monocular 3D pose estimation. The model is trained in a contrastive learning framework such that the feature representations become invariant to appearance variations while capturing 3D pose information. At test time, 3D pose is estimated by optimizing the NBV parameters and camera to maximize likelihood of the observed image feature under the generative model.Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of 3DNBF on standard 3D pose estimation benchmarks. More importantly, the method substantially outperforms previous regression-based and optimization-based approaches under occlusion. This is attributed to the robust likelihood function and pose-dependent features that enable resolving ambiguities. The paper introduces a new challenging adversarial occlusion benchmark, on which 3DNBF maintains high accuracy while other methods degrade dramatically. Overall, the proposed generative 3D-aware analysis-by-synthesis approach enables accurate and occlusion-robust monocular 3D human pose estimation.
