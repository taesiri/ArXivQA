# [3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting for Occlusion Robust 3D Human Pose   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10123)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to make monocular 3D human pose estimation robust to occlusion. The key hypothesis is that by taking a generative modeling approach and performing approximate analysis-by-synthesis at the feature level, the method can become highly robust to occlusion while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance on non-occluded data. Specifically, the hypotheses are:1. A volumetric human body representation with Gaussian kernel features (Neural Body Volumes) allows efficient and robust differentiable rendering on the feature level.2. Imposing a pose-conditioned distribution on the kernel features makes them 3D-aware and helps resolve the inherent 2D-3D ambiguity in monocular 3D pose estimation. 3. An iterative process of contrastive feature learning and maximum likelihood training of the kernel features enables extracting 3D-aware features invariant to instance-specific details.4. Combining bottom-up regression with top-down neural body fitting at test time leads to occlusion robustness while remaining efficient.The key research contributions are:- Proposing Neural Body Volumes, a volumetric articulated body model for feature rendering.- Introducing 3D-aware pose-dependent kernel features. - A contrastive learning framework for training 3D-aware features.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and occlusion robustness on several 3D pose estimation benchmarks.In summary, the paper hypothesizes that by performing analysis-by-synthesis in a learned 3D-aware feature space, monocular 3D human pose estimation can be made highly robust to occlusion. The proposed method 3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) aims to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a 3D-aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) framework for 3D human pose estimation that is robust to occlusions. 2. It introduces a novel generative model called Neural Body Volumes (NBV) to represent human bodies for feature-level analysis-by-synthesis. NBV uses a volumetric representation with Gaussian kernels that emit pose-dependent feature vectors.3. It presents a contrastive learning framework to train the feature extractor along with NBV such that the features capture local 3D pose information of body parts, helping resolve the 2D-3D ambiguity.4. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of 3DNBF on multiple 3D human pose estimation benchmarks, especially under occlusion, outperforming other regression-based and optimization-based methods.5. It proposes a challenging adversarial occlusion robustness benchmark called 3DPW-AdvOcc to evaluate different methods.In summary, the main contribution is a novel analysis-by-synthesis framework for 3D human pose estimation using a learned volumetric human body representation that is robust to occlusions and helps resolve the 2D-3D ambiguity through 3D-aware contrastive feature learning. The method is extensively evaluated and demonstrated to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a 3D-aware neural body fitting (3DNBF) approach for robust 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, using an analysis-by-synthesis framework with a novel volumetric neural body representation that imposes pose-dependent feature distributions to resolve 2D-3D ambiguity.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in 3D human pose estimation:- The main contribution is proposing a generative model-based approach for 3D human pose estimation that is robust to occlusions. This is different from most prior work that uses discriminative models like neural networks to directly regress the 3D pose.- Compared to other generative approaches like SMPLify, this method uses a learned deep generative model of features rather than relying on hand-designed features like 2D keypoints. The 3D-aware features help resolve the ambiguity in lifting 2D to 3D. - The volumetric body representation is more amenable to gradient-based fitting than mesh-based models used before. It also handles self-occlusions more gracefully.- The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard 3D pose estimation benchmarks like 3DPW. This demonstrates it works well for non-occluded cases too.- More importantly, it shows significantly improved robustness to occlusion compared to prior regression-based methods on occlusion datasets like 3DPW-Occ. The adversarial evaluation further supports this.- Compared to other optimization-based approaches, it shows better performance when initialized from the same regressor, indicating the learned features and volumetric formulation help optimization.- The iterative regression plus generative fitting approach balances accuracy and speed. Fitting the generative model to features helps resolve errors in the initial regression estimate.- The contrastive representation learning framework is quite standard now but is effectively adapted here to learn 3D-aware features.In summary, the key novelty is in proposing a generative model approach to harness the benefits of both regression and iterative fitting for occlusion-robust 3D human pose estimation. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both occluded and non-occluded cases.
