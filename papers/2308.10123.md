# [3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting for Occlusion Robust 3D Human Pose   Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10123)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to make monocular 3D human pose estimation robust to occlusion. The key hypothesis is that by taking a generative modeling approach and performing approximate analysis-by-synthesis at the feature level, the method can become highly robust to occlusion while still maintaining state-of-the-art performance on non-occluded data. Specifically, the hypotheses are:1. A volumetric human body representation with Gaussian kernel features (Neural Body Volumes) allows efficient and robust differentiable rendering on the feature level.2. Imposing a pose-conditioned distribution on the kernel features makes them 3D-aware and helps resolve the inherent 2D-3D ambiguity in monocular 3D pose estimation. 3. An iterative process of contrastive feature learning and maximum likelihood training of the kernel features enables extracting 3D-aware features invariant to instance-specific details.4. Combining bottom-up regression with top-down neural body fitting at test time leads to occlusion robustness while remaining efficient.The key research contributions are:- Proposing Neural Body Volumes, a volumetric articulated body model for feature rendering.- Introducing 3D-aware pose-dependent kernel features. - A contrastive learning framework for training 3D-aware features.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and occlusion robustness on several 3D pose estimation benchmarks.In summary, the paper hypothesizes that by performing analysis-by-synthesis in a learned 3D-aware feature space, monocular 3D human pose estimation can be made highly robust to occlusion. The proposed method 3D-Aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) aims to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a 3D-aware Neural Body Fitting (3DNBF) framework for 3D human pose estimation that is robust to occlusions. 2. It introduces a novel generative model called Neural Body Volumes (NBV) to represent human bodies for feature-level analysis-by-synthesis. NBV uses a volumetric representation with Gaussian kernels that emit pose-dependent feature vectors.3. It presents a contrastive learning framework to train the feature extractor along with NBV such that the features capture local 3D pose information of body parts, helping resolve the 2D-3D ambiguity.4. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of 3DNBF on multiple 3D human pose estimation benchmarks, especially under occlusion, outperforming other regression-based and optimization-based methods.5. It proposes a challenging adversarial occlusion robustness benchmark called 3DPW-AdvOcc to evaluate different methods.In summary, the main contribution is a novel analysis-by-synthesis framework for 3D human pose estimation using a learned volumetric human body representation that is robust to occlusions and helps resolve the 2D-3D ambiguity through 3D-aware contrastive feature learning. The method is extensively evaluated and demonstrated to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches.
