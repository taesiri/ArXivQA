# [Abstract Visual Reasoning: An Algebraic Approach for Solving Raven's   Progressive Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11730)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is to propose a new reasoning framework called "algebraic machine reasoning" for solving abstract reasoning tasks such as Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). The central hypothesis is that abstract reasoning can be effectively realized through algebraic computations involving ideals in polynomial rings. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. Abstract concepts and patterns in reasoning tasks like RPM can be represented algebraically as ideals and operations on ideals.

2. The discovery of new abstract patterns and relationships, a key challenge in abstract reasoning, can be converted to computable algebraic problems involving ideals, such as computing primary decompositions. 

3. By representing concepts algebraically and formulating pattern discovery as algebraic computations, the difficult process of reasoning and problem solving on novel tasks can be reduced to routine algebraic computations.

4. This algebraic approach can match or exceed human performance on abstract reasoning benchmarks like RPM, without needing task-specific training or optimization.

In essence, the paper puts forth algebraic machine reasoning as a new paradigm for abstract reasoning that differs fundamentally from existing statistical or neural approaches. The central hypothesis is that the algebraic structure of ideals and the computational machinery of commutative algebra provides the missing ingredient for advancing machine reasoning and cognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new machine reasoning framework called "algebraic machine reasoning". The key ideas are:

- Representing concepts and patterns as algebraic objects called ideals, rather than using logic or neural networks. 

- Reducing the reasoning process to solving computational problems in algebra involving these ideals, such as computing primary decompositions.

- Applying this framework to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices, a well-known test of fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. 

- Introducing 4 "invariance modules" to extract meaningful patterns from the Raven's matrices, mimicking aspects of human reasoning.

- Demonstrating that their proposed algebraic machine reasoning framework can not only select answers for Raven's problems from a given set, but also generate new answers without needing any answer set.

- Evaluating their method on RAVEN and I-RAVEN datasets, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art results and exceeding average human performance.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel algebraic approach for machine reasoning and abstract pattern recognition, with very promising results on a challenging visual reasoning benchmark. The key insight is representing concepts algebraically rather than logically, and solving reasoning tasks by computations on these algebraic objects.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new algebraic machine reasoning framework for solving abstract visual reasoning problems like Raven's Progressive Matrices, by representing visual concepts as ideals in polynomial rings and reducing reasoning tasks to computational algebra problems involving these ideals.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces a new approach for solving abstract reasoning problems, called algebraic machine reasoning. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- Uses algebraic methods rather than machine learning/deep learning. Most recent work on abstract reasoning uses deep neural networks trained on task-specific datasets. In contrast, this paper proposes representing concepts as algebraic objects called ideals and solving reasoning tasks by computing with these ideals. 

- Does not require task-specific training. Many existing reasoning methods require optimizing model performance on training data. This approach does not involve any task-specific training or optimization, avoiding potential issues like overfitting.

- Aims for human-like reasoning. The paper argues that extensive training contradicts human-like abstract reasoning, which should not need much task-specific practice. The algebraic approach better matches gifted humans solving novel problems without training.

- Infers new patterns beyond given rules. Most methods are limited to recognizing patterns humans specify as rules. But this approach can discover new patterns, like in their Fig. 5, going beyond the designed rules.

- Generates answers, not just selects. Many models only select an answer from given options. This method can algorithmically generate new answers without needing any answer choices.

- Interpretable and grounded reasoning process. The algebraic computations have more understandable semantics than opaque neural network computations.

Overall, the key novelty is using the structure of algebraic objects like ideals to represent concepts and solve reasoning problems interpretably without task-specific training. It demonstrates competitive performance while avoiding some limitations of current learning-based reasoning methods. The algebraic viewpoint is fundamentally different and opens possibilities for more human-like machine reasoning.
