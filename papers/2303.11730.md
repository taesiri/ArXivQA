# [Abstract Visual Reasoning: An Algebraic Approach for Solving Raven's   Progressive Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11730)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is to propose a new reasoning framework called "algebraic machine reasoning" for solving abstract reasoning tasks such as Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). The central hypothesis is that abstract reasoning can be effectively realized through algebraic computations involving ideals in polynomial rings. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. Abstract concepts and patterns in reasoning tasks like RPM can be represented algebraically as ideals and operations on ideals.

2. The discovery of new abstract patterns and relationships, a key challenge in abstract reasoning, can be converted to computable algebraic problems involving ideals, such as computing primary decompositions. 

3. By representing concepts algebraically and formulating pattern discovery as algebraic computations, the difficult process of reasoning and problem solving on novel tasks can be reduced to routine algebraic computations.

4. This algebraic approach can match or exceed human performance on abstract reasoning benchmarks like RPM, without needing task-specific training or optimization.

In essence, the paper puts forth algebraic machine reasoning as a new paradigm for abstract reasoning that differs fundamentally from existing statistical or neural approaches. The central hypothesis is that the algebraic structure of ideals and the computational machinery of commutative algebra provides the missing ingredient for advancing machine reasoning and cognition.
