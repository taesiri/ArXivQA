# [Abstract Visual Reasoning: An Algebraic Approach for Solving Raven's   Progressive Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11730)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research focus of this paper is to propose a new reasoning framework called "algebraic machine reasoning" for solving abstract reasoning tasks such as Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). The central hypothesis is that abstract reasoning can be effectively realized through algebraic computations involving ideals in polynomial rings. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that:

1. Abstract concepts and patterns in reasoning tasks like RPM can be represented algebraically as ideals and operations on ideals.

2. The discovery of new abstract patterns and relationships, a key challenge in abstract reasoning, can be converted to computable algebraic problems involving ideals, such as computing primary decompositions. 

3. By representing concepts algebraically and formulating pattern discovery as algebraic computations, the difficult process of reasoning and problem solving on novel tasks can be reduced to routine algebraic computations.

4. This algebraic approach can match or exceed human performance on abstract reasoning benchmarks like RPM, without needing task-specific training or optimization.

In essence, the paper puts forth algebraic machine reasoning as a new paradigm for abstract reasoning that differs fundamentally from existing statistical or neural approaches. The central hypothesis is that the algebraic structure of ideals and the computational machinery of commutative algebra provides the missing ingredient for advancing machine reasoning and cognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new machine reasoning framework called "algebraic machine reasoning". The key ideas are:

- Representing concepts and patterns as algebraic objects called ideals, rather than using logic or neural networks. 

- Reducing the reasoning process to solving computational problems in algebra involving these ideals, such as computing primary decompositions.

- Applying this framework to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices, a well-known test of fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. 

- Introducing 4 "invariance modules" to extract meaningful patterns from the Raven's matrices, mimicking aspects of human reasoning.

- Demonstrating that their proposed algebraic machine reasoning framework can not only select answers for Raven's problems from a given set, but also generate new answers without needing any answer set.

- Evaluating their method on RAVEN and I-RAVEN datasets, significantly outperforming prior state-of-the-art results and exceeding average human performance.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a novel algebraic approach for machine reasoning and abstract pattern recognition, with very promising results on a challenging visual reasoning benchmark. The key insight is representing concepts algebraically rather than logically, and solving reasoning tasks by computations on these algebraic objects.
