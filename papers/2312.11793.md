# [An effective image copy-move forgery detection using entropy image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing keypoint-based copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) methods often fail to generate sufficient matches when tampered patches are in smooth areas of an image. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce entropy images to determine coordinates and scales of keypoints, resulting in significantly more keypoints compared to using grayscale images, especially in smooth regions.
- Develop an entropy level clustering algorithm to avoid increased matching complexity caused by non-ideal distribution of grayscale values among keypoints.

Main Contributions:
- Using entropy images instead of grayscale images to generate keypoints, increasing number of keypoints by 1.5 times, leading to improved performance in smooth regions. 
- Entropy level clustering of keypoints based on both grayscale and entropy values, handling issue of keypoints concentrated in a narrow grayscale range which reduces efficiency.
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CMH and GRIP datasets, with 99.07% TPR and 0% FPR on CMH+GRIPori dataset.  
- Preserves efficiency by clustering to limit matching complexity, estimated to be 29% faster matching than state-of-the-art when tested on GRIP dataset.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective CMFD method using entropy images and entropy level clustering that improves performance in smooth regions while preserving efficiency. Key contributions are increasing keypoints in smooth areas via entropy images, handling non-ideal keypoint distributions with entropy clustering, and achieving improved accuracy on public datasets while maintaining time efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an effective copy-move forgery detection method using entropy images to determine keypoints and an entropy level clustering algorithm to improve matching efficiency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) using entropy images. Specifically, it has two key contributions:

1. It introduces entropy images to determine the coordinates and scales of keypoints. This results in a denser distribution of keypoints, including in smooth regions where traditional keypoint detectors often fail to generate sufficient matches. 

2. It develops an entropy level clustering algorithm to address the increased matching complexity caused by non-ideal grayscale distribution of keypoints. This helps improve the efficiency of the matching process.

In summary, the paper proposes an effective CMFD method that achieves a good balance between performance and time efficiency by using entropy images for keypoint detection and an entropy level clustering strategy for efficient matching. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over previous keypoint-based and block-based CMFD techniques.
