# [Reduction Rules and ILP Are All You Need: Minimal Directed Feedback   Vertex Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01119)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How effective can a solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem be if it relies primarily on reduction rules and Integer Linear Programming (ILP), without implementing complex search heuristics or branch-and-bound algorithms?The paper describes the development of a solver for the Minimal DFVS problem that is centered around aggressively reducing the problem to a Minimal Cover problem using reduction rules, and then solving the resulting ILP formulation using an off-the-shelf solver (SCIP). The key hypotheses appear to be:- Reduction rules can be powerful enough to completely solve many DFVS instances without needing complex search.- Formulating the reduced problem as an ILP will allow leveraging sophisticated MILP solver heuristics and avoid having to build a custom branch-and-bound framework.- Focusing effort on translating the problem to a high-quality ILP formulation will be more effective than custom search heuristics.The paper seems to provide evidence supporting these hypotheses, with the solver achieving strong performance on the competition test set, despite not implementing its own search framework. The central research question is assessing if this reduction-focused ILP approach can be highly effective for DFVS.
