# [Reduction Rules and ILP Are All You Need: Minimal Directed Feedback   Vertex Set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01119)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How effective can a solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem be if it relies primarily on reduction rules and Integer Linear Programming (ILP), without implementing complex search heuristics or branch-and-bound algorithms?

The paper describes the development of a solver for the Minimal DFVS problem that is centered around aggressively reducing the problem to a Minimal Cover problem using reduction rules, and then solving the resulting ILP formulation using an off-the-shelf solver (SCIP). 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

- Reduction rules can be powerful enough to completely solve many DFVS instances without needing complex search.

- Formulating the reduced problem as an ILP will allow leveraging sophisticated MILP solver heuristics and avoid having to build a custom branch-and-bound framework.

- Focusing effort on translating the problem to a high-quality ILP formulation will be more effective than custom search heuristics.

The paper seems to provide evidence supporting these hypotheses, with the solver achieving strong performance on the competition test set, despite not implementing its own search framework. The central research question is assessing if this reduction-focused ILP approach can be highly effective for DFVS.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper describes the development of an exact solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem for the PACE 2022 competition. The main contributions are:

- The solver relies heavily on reduction rules, adapted from the vertex cover literature, to reduce the DFVS instance down to a minimal set of constraints that can be formulated as an integer linear program (ILP). This allows a powerful ILP solver like SCIP to tackle the core problem.

- Several effective reduction rules are presented for shrinking the input graph and extracting the minimal cycles to cover. In many test instances, the rules were powerful enough to completely solve the problem without needing the ILP solver. 

- The solver integrates nicely with SCIP, using a lazy constraint callback to enforce any remaining DFVS constraints not expressed in the ILP formulation. With good initial cycle information, this required only 1-2 calls to the solver in most cases.

- The solver achieved very competitive performance, scoring second place in the PACE 2022 competition. This provides evidence that reduction to ILP plus some problem-specific rules can build an effective exact algorithm.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating a reduction-centric approach that translates DFVS into the well-studied ILP framework as much as possible. The power of general ILP solvers allows the algorithm designer to focus efforts on the reduction rules.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper describes the development of a high-performing solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem that relies on aggressive reduction to a minimal cover problem and applying adapted vertex cover reduction rules, before formulating and solving the problem as an integer linear program.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the reduction rules, for example by adapting more known vertex cover reductions to handle non-bare vertices, developing new reductions like generalized desks, or finding faster algorithms for checks like identifying weak bridges.

- Developing better algorithms for enumerating minimal cycles in a graph. The authors note this is likely hard in general, but better practical algorithms could help transform more of the problem into a cover problem.

- Experimenting with other MILP formulations like using network flow constraints. The authors chose to focus just on a basic binary variable model with lazy cycle constraints.

- Trying other ways to interact with the MILP solver, like providing heuristic solutions or adding constraints at nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. The authors found these unhelpful, but further experiments may find more productive ways to cooperate with the solver.

- Applying the ideas to the undirected Feedback Vertex Set problem, where enumerating chordless cycles is easier.

- Developing more sophisticated data reduction rules tailored specifically to the DFVS problem structure, rather than relying mainly on adapting vertex cover reductions.

- Exploring whether the ideas could be extended to an approximation algorithm or heuristic by solving the LP relaxation.

Overall, the authors highlight opportunities to build on their work in both the reduction/preprocessing stage and the integration with MILP solvers. Both improving the problem transformation and strengthening the underlying solver could lead to better performance.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper describes the development of an exact solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem as part of the PACE 2022 competition. The solver tries to aggressively reduce the problem to a Minimal Cover problem and applies reduction rules adapted from Vertex Cover literature. The resulting problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program and solved using SCIP. The solver performed second-best in the competition, although a bug at submission disqualified it. The paper also introduces a new vertex cover reduction rule generalizing the Desk rule. The key ideas are translating the problem into a mature MILP framework to leverage its heuristics, and applying well-studied reduction rules, rather than building custom branch-and-bound algorithms.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Unfortunately without reading the full paper, it is difficult to fully assess how it compares to other research in the field. However, based on the abstract and introduction, a few observations can be made:

- The paper seems to focus on developing an exact solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem. This is an important problem in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. 

- The approach combines reduction rules, transforming the problem into a minimal cover problem, with an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation solved by SCIP. This seems like a reasonable hybrid approach, leveraging the power of ILP solvers while also using problem-specific reductions.

- The solver performed very well in the PACE 2022 competition, coming in second place. This suggests it represents the state-of-the-art in exact algorithms for this problem. 

- The author introduces a new generalized desk reduction rule for vertex cover problems. This contributes a novel reduction rule to the well-studied area of kernelization for vertex cover.

- Overall, the work seems to advance the state-of-the-art in exact/fixed parameter tractable algorithms for Directed Feedback Vertex Set. The hybrid ILP + kernelization approach is competitive with other methods. The introduction of a new reduction rule also makes a contribution.

To fully assess the paper, it would be useful to know how it compares to other ILP, kernelization, and hybrid methods applied to DFVS. Are the reduction rules novel compared to prior work? Does the ILP formulation improve on past approaches? How does the overall performance compare quantitatively? Readers familiar with literature in this subfield would be able to provide deeper comparative assessment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper describes the development of an exact solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set problem as part of the PACE 2022 competition. The core idea is to aggressively reduce the problem to a Minimal Cover problem by finding minimal cycles in the graph. Reduction rules adapted from Vertex Cover literature are then applied to shrink the problem further. The resulting Integer Linear Program is solved using SCIP. 

The solver performs two main steps - applying reduction rules to the input graph to shrink, sparsify and split it, and identifying minimal cycles to turn the problem into cover constraints. Further reduction rules are then applied to the cycle cover constraints before solving with MILP. The solver performed very well in the competition, although was disqualified due to a bug. The paper also proposes a new generalized Desk reduction rule for vertex cover problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper describes the development of an exact solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem for the PACE 2022 competition. The main method is to aggressively reduce the DFVS problem to a Minimal Cover problem by applying reduction rules adapted from Vertex Cover literature. The resulting cover problem is formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and solved using the SCIP solver. The key steps are:

1) Apply reduction rules like contracting degree 1 vertices to shrink and sparsify the input graph. 

2) Identify minimal cycles in the graph to transform it into DFVS constraints and cover constraints.

3) Apply reduction rules like resolving funnels and desks to the cover constraints, especially size-2 constraints which resemble vertex cover. 

4) Formulate the final problem as an ILP with lazy constraints for any remaining DFVS constraints and solve with SCIP.

The main innovation is the extensive use of reduction rules to simplify the graph and transform the bulk of the problem into a cover problem, allowing a standard ILP solver to tackle the core search. This performed very well, scoring second place in the competition.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is describing the development of an exact solver for the Minimal Directed Feedback Vertex Set (DFVS) problem for the 2022 Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments (PACE) challenge. The DFVS problem asks, given a directed graph G=(V,E), to find the smallest set of vertices whose removal leaves an acyclic graph. 

The key points from the paper are:

- The authors built their solver primarily using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), implemented using the SCIP solver, rather than designing their own branch-and-bound framework. This allows leveraging the power and heuristics of modern ILP solvers.

- The solver applies aggressive reduction rules to shrink and simplify the DFVS instance before translating to ILP. This includes splitting into strongly connected components, contracting degree 1 nodes, and reducing cycles to cover constraints. 

- Additional reduction rules adapted from vertex cover literature are applied to the cycle cover constraints to further simplify before handing to the ILP solver.

- For remaining graph components, lazy constraints are added to the ILP formulation to enforce acyclicity.

- The resulting solver performed very well on the PACE test instances, achieving the 2nd best score among submitted solvers.

So in summary, the key question addressed is how to effectively solve DFVS using primarily ILP techniques, reduction rules, and interfacing with state-of-the-art ILP solvers like SCIP. The paper describes the techniques and design decisions made in building their high-performing solver.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper relies heavily on reduction rules adapted from the vertex cover literature. Why do you think techniques for vertex cover transfer well to the directed feedback vertex set problem? What are the key similarities and differences between the two problems that enable this?

2. The paper mentions several additional reduction rules that were considered but not implemented, such as crown reductions and co-matching into a clique. What challenges do you anticipate in adapting these rules to handle vertices that belong to multiple constraints or unreduced graphs? How might these challenges be addressed?

3. The minimal cycle enumeration rules seem crucial for transforming the problem into a cover problem. Rule 8 in particular seems powerful but slow. Can you think of a more efficient algorithm or data structure to detect vertex pairs whose removal disconnects the graph? 

4. The brute force minimal cycle search has an early exit after 10 million nodes visited. How was this value chosen? Could adaptive limits or incremental cycle enumeration improve the search?

5. When the MILP solver finds a new integer feasible solution, a maximal set of disjoint cycles is added. What techniques could be used to find cycles likely to cut off the current solution? How does the random cycle search compare?

6. The paper mentions trying to provide heuristics and lazy constraints to the MILP solver, but found the full problem specification more effective. Why do you think this was the case? When are lazy constraints useful versus detrimental?

7. The solver performs very well without implementing its own branch-and-bound search. What factors likely contribute to this? When would developing a custom search procedure be beneficial?

8. The solver splits the problem into independent subproblems via SCC decomposition and small disconnected graphs. How else could the problem be decomposed during reduction? What complications arise from shared vertices between components?

9. The paper introduces a generalized desk reduction rule. Can you think of any other ways standard vertex cover reductions could be generalized? What types of structures seem amenable to this?

10. If you were to extend this work, what would be your priorities in improving the reduction rules, cycle enumeration, or MILP interaction? Which areas seem likely to yield the biggest performance gains?
