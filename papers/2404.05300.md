# [Texture Classification Network Integrating Adaptive Wavelet Transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05300)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graves' disease is a common thyroid disorder that is diagnosed by determining the texture smoothness and morphology of the thyroid in ultrasound images. 
- Current methods using CNNs for diagnosis have limited ability to capture texture features. Wavelets can describe textures well but have drawbacks like manual feature extraction and selection.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a network integrating CNN and adaptive wavelet transform to enhance texture feature extraction from ultrasound images for Graves' disease diagnosis.
- Design a learnable wavelet transform module based on Lifting Scheme that uses discrete wavelet transform for efficient 2D image decomposition into low and high frequency bands.
- Parallelize a multi-resolution wavelet branch into ResNet18 CNN to enable learning features in both spatial (by CNN) and frequency (by wavelets) domains.

Main Contributions:
- Designed an adaptive wavelet transform module that can decompose 2D images using just one Lifting Scheme module.
- Integrated a parallel wavelet branch with multi-resolution analysis into ResNet18 to analyze texture in spatial and frequency domains simultaneously.
- Demonstrated accuracy of 97.9% and recall of 95.86% on ultrasound datasets of Graves' disease, outperforming ResNet18 and other methods.
- Showed adaptability to natural images by getting 60.76% on KTH dataset, exceeding ResNet18 by 1.67%.
- Provided ablation studies analyzing impact of network hyperparameters like insertion position and decomposition levels.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel CNN-wavelet network for texture classification that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy by effectively fusing spatial and frequency information using an integrated parallel wavelet transform branch.
