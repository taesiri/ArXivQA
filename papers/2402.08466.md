# [Taking Training Seriously: Human Guidance and Management-Based   Regulation of Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08466)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Rapid development of AI systems, especially for high-risk applications like healthcare and autonomous vehicles, has raised concerns about potential harms. This is leading to new AI regulations focused on safety, accountability, and human oversight.

- Emerging regulatory approaches in the US, EU, and from standards bodies like ISO take a "management-based" approach that requires procedures for risk assessment, validation, and auditing. This necessitates human guidance in AI system development.

- Machine learning models that train themselves autonomously on data can learn effectively but lack interpretability and alignment with human intuitions. This is problematic for high-stakes AI applications.

Solution:
- The paper advocates for "human-guided training" where human domain experts oversee and provide guidance during the training process. This can improve model alignment, explainability, and compatibility with regulatory needs.

- Humans can guide training by: (a) augmenting training data with expert annotations, (b) integrating human knowledge into model architectures, and (c) adding terms to loss functions that encourage alignment with human judgments.

- Vision tasks are used as an example. Expert-provided saliency maps indicating important regions in images can be integrated to encourage models to mimic human attention patterns.

Benefits:
- Can improve model transparency, interpretability, and trustworthiness compared to pure data-driven training
- May accelerate regulatory approval by demonstrating meaningful human oversight
- Allows AI and human intelligence to complement each other
- Compatible with emerging management-based regulatory frameworks that require human validation

Limitations:
- Acquiring sufficient expert guidance data can be costly and time-consuming
- Human errors may propagate into models
- Applicability depends on tasks where human expertise exceeds AI capabilities
- Issues with faithfulness of some explainability measures to true model reasoning

In conclusion, taking training seriously via human guidance is advocated as an oversight mechanism for developing safer, more reliable AI that is compatible with regulations.
