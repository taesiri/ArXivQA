# [HyperLLaVA: Dynamic Visual and Language Expert Tuning for Multimodal   Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA use a static vision-language projector and static tuning strategy for the language model. This may limit their flexibility and performance across different downstream multimodal tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes HyperLLaVA, which incorporates dynamic tuning of both the projector and language model:
  - A visual expert module is introduced to generate dynamic parameters for part of the projector based on the visual features. This helps adapt the projected visual tokens better for the language model.
  - A language expert module is used to generate dynamic parameters for some of the language model blocks based on intermediate language features. This helps tune the model better for different multimodal instructions.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the idea of dynamic tuning of projector and language model in MLLMs to improve flexibility across tasks
- Introduces lightweight visual and language expert modules based on HyperNetworks to enable dynamic parameter generation 
- Achieves new state-of-the-art results across 12 MLLM benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior MLLMs like LLaVA
- Provides detailed analysis and studies on the design choices for the expert modules and dynamic tuning strategies
- Demonstrates the method's effectiveness as a parameter-efficient tuning approach for multimodal adaptation

In summary, the paper explores dynamic tuning of MLLMs via tailored visual and language experts, advancing flexibility and performance across diverse multimodal tasks. The extensive analyses prove the solution's efficacy and properties.
