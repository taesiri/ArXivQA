# [GenHowTo: Learning to Generate Actions and State Transformations from   Instructional Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07322)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces GenHowTo, a novel generative model for transforming input images to showcase actions or object state changes according to given text prompts. The key idea is to leverage a large corpus of instructional videos, from which triplets of frames are automatically extracted to obtain training examples of (1) initial object states, (2) actions, and (3) final object states after transformation. Equipped with around 200k such triplets and corresponding text prompts automatically obtained via captioning, GenHowTo is realized as an image-conditioned diffusion model adapted from Stable Diffusion. During inference, GenHowTo takes an input image and text prompt and generates a new image showcasing the action or object's final state while preserving irrelevant parts of the input scene. The method is evaluated on held-out object transformations, outperforming baselines like InstructPix2Pix and Edit-Friendly Diffusion models in a classification benchmark and FID metric. Qualitative results demonstrate GenHowTo's ability to faithfully modify objects, introduce new interacting elements like hands, and maintain consistent backgrounds when transforming input images per text prompts. The work represents an advance in semantic image editing and conditional image generation grounded in real visual data of state changes and actions extracted automatically from narrated instructional video footage.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GenHowTo, a text- and image-conditioned generative model trained on automatically extracted image triplets and captions from instructional videos, that can transform input images to showcase actions or final object states while preserving unrelated parts of the scene.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Addressing the problem of generating physically plausible state transformations of input images according to a variety of action and final state prompts. The method aims to modify the input image to showcase the action or final state while preserving the scene from the input image.

2) Automatically collecting a large-scale training dataset from narrated instructional videos by extracting triplets of images depicting (i) initial object states, (ii) state-modifying actions, and (iii) resulting object transformations.

3) Proposing GenHowTo, a text-conditioned image generation model that transforms input images to depict actions or final states specified by text prompts while maintaining consistency with the input image scene.

4) Evaluating GenHowTo qualitatively and quantitatively, showing superior performance over existing methods. A quantitative evaluation is introduced where GenHowTo achieves 88% and 74% accuracy on seen and unseen interaction categories, significantly outperforming prior work.

The paper introduces "GenHowTo", a text- and image-conditioned generative model that can transform input images to generate new images showing actions and resulting object state changes. It leverages narrated instructional videos to automatically create training data consisting of image triplets and text descriptions. The key focus is on generating realistic and physically plausible images that preserve environment context while transforming objects according to textual prompts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to use instructional videos as a source of training data. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using instructional videos compared to other potential data sources? How does using instructional videos address some of the key challenges outlined?

2. The paper extracts triplets of frames from instructional videos showing (i) initial state, (ii) action state, and (iii) final state after transformation. What are some of the challenges in accurately extracting these frames? How does the self-supervised model used address these challenges? 

3. The model is conditioned on both images showing state transformations as well as text prompts describing the transformations. Why is using both modalities useful compared to just images or just text? What are some failure cases or limitations of relying on both image and text inputs?

4. The model has separate encoders for encoding the conditioning image and sampling noise distributions. Why is having two encoders useful compared to a single encoder? What are the tradeoffs?

5. The model initializes sampling from a latent representation of the input image rather than pure noise during inference. Why is this beneficial? When would initializing from pure noise be preferred instead?

6. The paper trains separate models for generating action states versus final object states after transformation. Why would training a single joint model be problematic? What are the limitations of having separate models?  

7. The paper introduces a new quantitative evaluation protocol using classifiers and FID to evaluate state transformation generation. What are the pros and cons of this protocol compared to human evaluation? When would human evaluation still be necessary?

8. What kinds of background scene elements does the model struggle to preserve perfectly across state transformations? Why do these particular elements prove challenging? How might the model be improved?

9. The model inherits biases and limitations from the weights it initializes from. What are some examples of societal biases that could be propagated from the initial model weights? How might these biases be addressed?

10. What modifications would be required to adapt the model to interactive applications like robotics vs the current static image generation setting? What new challenges arise in interactive state transformation generation?
