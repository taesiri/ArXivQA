# [Understanding the effects of language-specific class imbalance in   multilingual fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the effect of language-specific class imbalance in multilingual classification datasets, where the distribution of labels across languages is uneven. 
- Such imbalance is common in real-world datasets but its effects are understudied.

Methods:
- The authors create balanced and imbalanced versions of two datasets - Amazon reviews (6 languages) and XNLI (2 languages).
- They fine-tune mBERT on these datasets and analyze the effects on:
   - Task performance
   - Separation of languages in latent space
   - Reliance on informative vs uninformative tokens using SHAP values
- They also propose a modification to traditional class weighting to mitigate negative effects.

Key Findings:
- Imbalance worsens task performance and promotes language separation in latent space. 
- From SHAP values, the model relies less on informative tokens and more on uninformative tokens when predicting labels of over/under-represented languages.
- Weighing datapoints from each language/label combination separately mitigates these negative effects.

Main Contributions:
- Showing the clear detrimental effects of language-specific label imbalance
- Demonstrating how it causes the model to rely more on language identity than meaningful features
- Providing a simple method to reduce these effects by adapting traditional class weighting

The key insight is that imbalance leads the multilingual model to "cheat" by simply using language information for predictions. This highlights the need to carefully consider joint distributions, not just marginals, when working with multilingual datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper studies the detrimental effects of language-specific class imbalance in multilingual fine-tuning of transformer models, such as worse performance, greater separation of languages in the latent space, and reliance on uninformative features, and shows that calculating class weights separately per language helps mitigate these effects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Showing the detrimental effects of language-specific class imbalance in multilingual fine-tuning, namely worse performance and greater separation of languages in the latent space.

2) Using SHAP values to demonstrate that models trained on imbalanced data pay more attention to uninformative features, effectively acting more like language identifiers. 

3) Providing a simple method of mitigation by adapting the traditional class weighing approach to calculate weights separately for each language. This is shown to mitigate the negative effects of the imbalance.

In summary, the paper creates awareness of issues that can arise from language-specific class imbalance in multilingual fine-tuning, provides analysis to shed light on how models learn in this setting, and introduces a straightforward adaptation of class weighing to help address these problems. The key insight is that joint imbalances in multilingual data can incentivize models to rely more on language identification rather than learning robust multilingual features.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multilingual fine-tuning - The paper studies the effect of fine-tuning a transformer-based multilingual language model on downstream classification tasks.

- Class imbalance - The paper looks specifically at language-specific class imbalance, where the distribution of labels is skewed differently across languages in the training data. 

- Performance - The paper shows that class imbalance leads to worse performance on the downstream tasks.

- Language specificity - Class imbalance is shown to lead to more separation of languages and greater language specificity in the latent space of the model. 

- SHAP values - SHAP values are used to analyze how the model's predictions change in the presence of class imbalance, showing increased reliance on uninformative language-specific features.

- Mitigation - A modified class weighting method is proposed to weigh samples from different languages separately to mitigate negative effects of the class imbalance.

In summary, key terms cover multilingual learning, class imbalance, model explainability with SHAP, and mitigation strategies.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. Why did the authors artificially create class imbalance in the datasets rather than using naturally imbalanced real-world datasets? What are the benefits and drawbacks of this approach?

2. The class imbalance is created by skewing the joint distribution of languages and labels while keeping the marginal distributions uniform. Why is the joint distribution specifically important to study here? 

3. The authors show class imbalance worsens performance. Does the degree of imbalance correlate with the degree of performance drop? Is there a threshold effect or linear relationship? 

4. For the language identification experiments, what other metrics besides accuracy could reveal insights into how identifiable the languages are? For example, confidence of predictions?

5. In the SHAP analysis, how did the authors select the thresholds for determining positive, negative and neutral tokens? What impact could different thresholds have on the findings?  

6. The authors state the SHAP values have a bias due to different base values between models. What specifically causes this? And does their proposed masked input entropy loss completely eliminate this bias?

7. For the per-language class weighting experiments, how did the authors determine the optimal weighting scheme? Were other weighting formulas tested as well?

8. Could the proposed per-language class weighting method be improved by dynamically calculating weights during training based on learning trajectories?

9. Aside from class weighting, what other techniques could potentially mitigate effects of language-specific class imbalance during fine-tuning?

10. How well would the authors' findings and proposed method generalize to multilingual models besides mBERT and XLM-R? What model architectures could violate the assumptions?
