# [Understanding the effects of language-specific class imbalance in   multilingual fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13016)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the effect of language-specific class imbalance in multilingual classification datasets, where the distribution of labels across languages is uneven. 
- Such imbalance is common in real-world datasets but its effects are understudied.

Methods:
- The authors create balanced and imbalanced versions of two datasets - Amazon reviews (6 languages) and XNLI (2 languages).
- They fine-tune mBERT on these datasets and analyze the effects on:
   - Task performance
   - Separation of languages in latent space
   - Reliance on informative vs uninformative tokens using SHAP values
- They also propose a modification to traditional class weighting to mitigate negative effects.

Key Findings:
- Imbalance worsens task performance and promotes language separation in latent space. 
- From SHAP values, the model relies less on informative tokens and more on uninformative tokens when predicting labels of over/under-represented languages.
- Weighing datapoints from each language/label combination separately mitigates these negative effects.

Main Contributions:
- Showing the clear detrimental effects of language-specific label imbalance
- Demonstrating how it causes the model to rely more on language identity than meaningful features
- Providing a simple method to reduce these effects by adapting traditional class weighting

The key insight is that imbalance leads the multilingual model to "cheat" by simply using language information for predictions. This highlights the need to carefully consider joint distributions, not just marginals, when working with multilingual datasets.
