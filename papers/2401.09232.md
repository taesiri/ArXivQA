# [Dynamic Relation Transformer for Contextual Text Block Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09232)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the task of contextual text block detection (CTBD) in natural scenes. CTBD aims to detect coherent blocks of text made up of multiple words or lines of text arranged in their natural reading order. This is more challenging than conventional scene text detection which focuses on detecting individual words or lines. Key challenges for CTBD include handling diverse text styles/sizes, lack of clear alignment between text units in a block, and background noise obscuring text. Capturing complete contextual text blocks is important for subsequent language processing and image understanding tasks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel graph generation framework for CTBD. Individual text units detected in the image are represented as nodes in a graph. Reading order relationships between text units are predicted to form the edges between nodes. This converts CTBD into a graph generation problem. The framework has two key components:

1. An integral text detector (e.g. DQ-DETR) to identify individual text units as nodes
2. A novel Dynamic Relation Transformer module named DRFormer to predict relationships between text units as edges

DRFormer employs an iterative dynamic graph structure refinement process using a dual interactive transformer decoder. One decoder focuses on refining node features while the other refines edge features. Through multiple iterations of collaboration between the two decoders, node and edge embeddings are enhanced, leading to more accurate edge predictions and overall graph quality. DRFormer also integrates deformable attention to extract useful contextual information.

The entire framework including the text detector and DRFormer is trained end-to-end.

Main Contributions:

- First work to formulate CTBD as a graph generation problem and propose an iterative refinement procedure to improve graph quality
- Introduction of DRFormer module with a dual transformer decoder design to dynamically refine graph structure 
- State-of-the-art results on SCUT-CTW-Context and ReCTS-Context benchmark datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the graph generation framework

The paper provides comprehensive experimental analysis to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed techniques over existing methods for CTBD. Both quantitative and qualitative results validate the capability of the framework to detect coherent and logically connected text blocks within complex scene images.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as:

1. The paper proposes framing the task of contextual text block detection as a graph generation problem and introducing an iterative refinement procedure that gradually improves the quality of the generated graph.
