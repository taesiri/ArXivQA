# [CSDNet: Detect Salient Object in Depth-Thermal via A Lightweight Cross   Shallow and Deep Perception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10104)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing RGB-D and RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) methods treat RGB as the primary modality and depth/thermal as subsidiary modalities. This leads to redundancy. 
- Triple modality RGB-D-T methods achieve better performance but have huge model size and computational complexity.
- Depth and thermal modalities have low coherence between them, making it challenging for models to interpret and integrate them.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a lightweight Cross Shallow and Deep Perception Network (CSDNet) that only uses depth and thermal modalities for SOD.
- Introduce two modules: 
   1) CFAR Saliency Prescreening Module (CFARSP) - generates saliency-aware masks from depth and thermal to exchange spatial information at shallow layers.
   2) Implicit Coherence Activation Navigator Module (ICAN) - captures similarities and differences between depth and thermal semantics at deep layers.
- Use Segment Anything Model (SAM) to guide feature encoding through a SAM-Assist Encoder Pretraining (SAMAEP) framework. This helps extract more generalized features from depth and thermal.

Contributions:
- First study to explore synergies between low-coherence depth and thermal modalities.
- First SOD method to only use depth and thermal data.
- CFARSP and ICAN modules to integrate information from depth and thermal effectively. 
- SAMAEP framework to guide depth/thermal feature encoding using SAM.

Results:
- Outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-D and RGB-T methods on VDT-2048 dataset. Achieves comparable results to RGB-D-T method.
- 5.97x faster and requires 0.0036x fewer FLOPs than RGB-D-T method, suitable for edge devices.
- Robust performance under various challenging conditions like illumination changes, background interference etc.

The paper demonstrates effective integration of depth and thermal data using the proposed cross shallow and deep perception approach for lightweight yet accurate SOD.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel lightweight cross shallow and deep perception network called CSDNet to effectively integrate depth and thermal modalities with low coherence for salient object detection, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art RGB-D-T methods while being much more efficient.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

1. The authors propose a novel cross shallow and deep perception scheme to maximise the scene interpretation by leveraging low-coherence modalities (depth and thermal).

2. They introduce an innovative SAM-assist encoder pre-training framework to guide the encoder to extract more generalised features from the depth and thermal modalities. 

3. The authors implement the proposed method to the salient object detection network using only depth and thermal images. Comprehensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effective integration of depth and thermal modalities, outperforming state-of-the-art RGB-D and RGB-T methods.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a new approach (CSDNet) to effectively integrate low-coherence modalities (depth and thermal) for salient object detection, through novel cross shallow and deep perception and a SAM-assisted pre-training framework. This achieves comparable performance to methods using an additional RGB modality, with improved efficiency.
