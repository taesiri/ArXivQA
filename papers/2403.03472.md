# [Boosting Meta-Training with Base Class Information for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Few-shot learning aims to learn a model that can recognize new classes with only a few labeled examples. Meta-learning has become a popular approach for few-shot learning.
- Prior work like Meta-Baseline performs meta-learning after pre-training the feature extractor. However, performance declines after initial improvement, indicating conflict between pre-training and meta-training stages.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new end-to-end framework called Boost-MT with alternating outer and inner loops. 
- Outer loop: Compute classification loss on batch from base classes, update only the classifier layer. Provides class transferability.
- Inner loop: Compute few-shot task losses using meta-learning, update feature extractor using both inner and outer losses. Provides adaptation to few-shot tasks.
- Mutual guidance between base class information and meta-learning avoids conflict between pre-training and meta-training.

Main Contributions:
- First end-to-end framework that utilizes base class information to guide meta-learning, enabling faster convergence.
- Avoids performance decay in prior works by mutually reinforcing base class learning and meta-learning.  
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on miniImageNet and tieredImageNet datasets, outperforming Meta-Baseline.
- Model-agnostic framework, integrates easily into other meta-learners like CAN and FEAT, improves performance.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative end-to-end training approach that allows base class learning and meta-learning to mutually guide one another, achieving superior few-shot classification performance. The model-agnostic nature and state-of-the-art results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
