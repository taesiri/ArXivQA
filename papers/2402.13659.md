# [Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13659)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of this paper:

Problem:
- Large language model (LLM) providers collect user instructions to improve model alignment, but these instructions may contain sensitive information. 
- This poses privacy risks both during data annotation when instructions are exposed to humans, and during deployment if models memorize sensitive examples.

Proposed Solution:  
- Use differentially private (DP) text generators to create high-quality synthetic instructions.
- Train generators with DP optimizers to prevent memorization.  
- Develop a private filtering algorithm to select synthetic instructions that match the distribution of real instructions.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a two-stage approach to generate private synthetic instructions of high utility:
   1) Privately fine-tune generators. 
   2) Privately filter synthetic instructions.
- Empirically demonstrate privacy risks when training without DP by injecting canaries.
- Show high utility of private synthetic instructions for supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
- Achieve performance comparable to using real instructions without privacy, and outperform leading open-source models.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel framework to create differentially private synthetic instructions that can effectively replace real instructions in aligning LLMs. The utility is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on major alignment techniques.
