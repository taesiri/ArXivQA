# [VerA: Versatile Anonymization Fit for Clinical Facial Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02124)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents VerA, a versatile facial image anonymization method that can effectively anonymize regular images, clinical images, and image pairs while preserving necessary semantic components. VerA trains a generative model that disentangles semantics and high-level facial attributes, allowing control over identity, expression, pose, age, and individual semantic regions like eyes, nose, and mouth. This enables anonymizing clinical images to showcase medical interventions by randomizing identity while preserving the semantic region of interest. It also allows anonymizing image pairs consistently for before-after illustrations. Experiments show VerA matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods in anonymization, photorealism, and utility for regular images. Additionally, VerA uniquely enables versatile clinical and paired anonymization. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate its ability to preserve desired semantics and achieve consistent identities in pairs. The work could enable sharing informative medical imagery while protecting patient privacy.
