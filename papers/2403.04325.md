# [Measuring Meaning Composition in the Human Brain with Composition Scores   from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04325)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Meaning composition, where smaller linguistic units like words combine to form the meaning of phrases/sentences, is essential for language comprehension. But there lacks a computational metric to quantify the degree of composition. This hinders quantitative analysis of meaning composition in the human brain. 

Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel model-based metric called "Composition Score" to quantify meaning composition. It is designed based on the recently proposed key-value memory interpretation of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks in transformer language models.

- Specifically, the memory vectors in FFN blocks represent predicted vocabulary distributions. The Composition Score measures if these distributions are uniformly combined into the block's final prediction, indicating a high degree of composition. If only a few distributions dominate, the composition degree is considered low.  

- The Composition Score captures multifaceted aspects of composition beyond word frequency and syntactic information. It exhibits intricate patterns across model layers.

Contributions:
- Introduces Composition Score to quantify meaning composition in language models and human perception.

- Reveals the Composition Score correlates with widespread language network regions, encompassing areas underlying word frequency, syntactic processing, and general word sensitivity. This suggests the multifaceted nature of composition.

- The significant model layers providing the informative Composition Score are both low and high layers instead of only bottom frequent-word sensing layers. This indicates meaning composition in human perception relies on information beyond word frequency and memorization.

- Provides a new model-brain analysis approach to study meaning composition by linking Composition Scores from language models to human brain imaging data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel model-based metric called Composition Score to quantify meaning composition in language models, which correlates with brain regions associated with word frequency, structural processing, and general word sensitivity during human sentence comprehension.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing a novel model-based metric called the Composition Score to quantify the degree of meaning composition during sentence comprehension. The Composition Score leverages the key-value memory interpretation of transformer feed-forward network blocks to compute the composition of predicted vocabulary distributions within the blocks. Experiments show that the Composition Score correlates with brain regions associated with word frequency, structural processing, and general sensitivity to words, suggesting it captures the multifaceted nature of meaning composition in the human brain. So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the Composition Score metric and demonstrating its neural validity against fMRI data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The Composition Score is computed based on the key-value memory interpretation of transformer feedforward network blocks. What are the specific steps involved in mapping the activations of each neuron to a vocabulary distribution, and how is this distribution interpreted as encoding meaning? 

2. When defining the Composition Score, the Jensen-Shannon distance is used to quantify the difference between the predicted distributions from individual neurons and the final block prediction. Why was this distance metric chosen over other options such as KL divergence or cosine distance? 

3. The use of the activation-based approximation for computing the Composition Score is justified by the sparse activation patterns of FFN neurons. What percentage of neurons account for over 50\% of the total activation values on average, and how was the hyperparameter $d_m'$ chosen?

4. The patterns of Composition Scores across layers exhibit considerable variability as seen in Table 1. What might be some reasons for the distinct high/low scoring prefixes in different layers, and how might this relate to the model's training objective?  

5. While partial correlation exists between the Composition Score and control variables like word frequency, the strength is relatively low. What additional semantic or contextual properties might the Composition Score capture beyond word-level statistics?  

6. The significant brain regions correlated with the Composition Score encompass areas associated with multiple language functions. How might the engagement of these varied regions support the hypothesis that meaning composition is a multifaceted neural process?

7. Why might the middle layers of the LLaMA models exhibit higher correlation with brain activity compared to the extreme low and high layers? How could the patterns of scores and brain correlation inform architectural choices?  

8. How sensitive is the linkage between model Composition Scores and brain activity to factors like model scale, fine-tuning, and linguistic properties of the stimulus? What future work could provide more insight?

9. The study utilizes naturalistic stimuli. How might the findings translate to more constrained experimental paradigms? Could the Composition Score inform the design of controlled psycholinguistic studies?  

10. What are some promising directions for improving the Composition Score to better capture incremental meaning construction in the brain? How might insights from neuroscience studies further guide development of semantic composition metrics?
