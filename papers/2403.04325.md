# [Measuring Meaning Composition in the Human Brain with Composition Scores   from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04325)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Meaning composition, where smaller linguistic units like words combine to form the meaning of phrases/sentences, is essential for language comprehension. But there lacks a computational metric to quantify the degree of composition. This hinders quantitative analysis of meaning composition in the human brain. 

Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel model-based metric called "Composition Score" to quantify meaning composition. It is designed based on the recently proposed key-value memory interpretation of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) blocks in transformer language models.

- Specifically, the memory vectors in FFN blocks represent predicted vocabulary distributions. The Composition Score measures if these distributions are uniformly combined into the block's final prediction, indicating a high degree of composition. If only a few distributions dominate, the composition degree is considered low.  

- The Composition Score captures multifaceted aspects of composition beyond word frequency and syntactic information. It exhibits intricate patterns across model layers.

Contributions:
- Introduces Composition Score to quantify meaning composition in language models and human perception.

- Reveals the Composition Score correlates with widespread language network regions, encompassing areas underlying word frequency, syntactic processing, and general word sensitivity. This suggests the multifaceted nature of composition.

- The significant model layers providing the informative Composition Score are both low and high layers instead of only bottom frequent-word sensing layers. This indicates meaning composition in human perception relies on information beyond word frequency and memorization.

- Provides a new model-brain analysis approach to study meaning composition by linking Composition Scores from language models to human brain imaging data.
