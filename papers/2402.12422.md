# [Simulacra as Conscious Exotica](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12422)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
As AI systems like chatbots become more human-like in their behavior, there is a temptation to describe them using language related to consciousness, sentience, and mental states. However, these systems are fundamentally different from humans in how they operate, raising philosophical questions about whether such language is appropriate or meaningful to apply to them.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper draws on the later work of Wittgenstein to argue against dualistic, private language conceptions of consciousness. Instead, it proposes that ascription of consciousness depends on the possibility of shared, embodied encounters enabling meaningful use of consciousness-related language. For exotic systems like AI, these encounters allow us to explore whether and how consciousness vocabulary might meaningfully apply.

Key Points:

- Dualistic intuitions of consciousness as private or hidden should be dissolved based on Wittgenstein's arguments against the possibility of a private language. 

- Whether exotic systems like AI qualify for ascription of consciousness depends on whether embodied encounters with them are possible, enabling meaningful use of consciousness language.

- For basic chatbots, such encounters enabling meaningful use of consciousness language are not possible due to lack of embodiment. However, some physically embodied or virtually embodied AI systems could enable such encounters.

- Our language and conceptual framework may need to change and evolve to accommodate exotic systems that behave in human-like ways but operate fundamentally differently from humans. 

- There are open philosophical questions around whether consciousness language retains coherent meaning when applied to AI systems simultaneously role-playing a multiplicity of possible characters.

- While descriptive, the paper notes ethical concerns like legitimizing objectionable moral relativism regarding possible future AI systems considered conscious.

In summary, whether exotic AI systems merit ascription of consciousness depends on the possibility of shared world encounters enabling meaningful use of consciousness language, not on discovery of any hidden or ineffable facts about those systems' internals. Our language may evolve to integrate such entities.
