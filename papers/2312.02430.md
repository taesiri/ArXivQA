# [Almost-Sure Safety Guarantees of Stochastic Zero-Control Barrier   Functions Do Not Hold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02430)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper reveals a flaw in a previous 2021 paper that claimed to provide a method for guaranteeing almost sure safety (safety with probability one) for stochastic control systems using stochastic zero control barrier functions (ZCBFs). Through a simple counterexample of uncontrolled Brownian motion, the authors show that the theorem and proof in the 2021 paper are invalid. They then examine the implications for stochastic reciprocal control barrier functions (RCBFs), which rely on a similar proof technique. While unable to find counterexamples in this case, the authors provide an alternative proof showing that stochastic RCBFs do guarantee almost sure safety. Leveraging this result, they derive a modified condition for stochastic ZCBFs to ensure safety with probability one. Finally, the authors discuss how the key factor enabling almost sure safety for RCBFs is not simply unbounded controls, but rather the rate of divergence of the drift and diffusion terms. Overall, this paper clearly reveals the flaw in previous ZCBF safety guarantees and provides important new theoretical results and insights around ensuring stochastic safety.
