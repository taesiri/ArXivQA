# [APLe: Token-Wise Adaptive for Multi-Modal Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pre-trained vision-language (V-L) models like CLIP show promise for generalization to downstream tasks, but have challenges like sensitivity to text prompts and difficulty tuning across multi-modal prompts.
- Existing methods use uni-modal or coupled multi-modal prompting, but have issues like overfitting due to prompt length and inability to handle differences in vision vs language modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose APLe - Token-Wise Adaptive for Multi-Modal Prompt Learning 
- Uses independent, sequential multi-modal prompt learning with adaptation to address challenges
- Has image adapter to mitigate image noise and enhance features
- Does sequential token-wise knowledge training to learn prompts as tokens with CLIP knowledge to reduce overfitting
- Finally does multi-modal token adaptation to promote synergy between modalities

Main Contributions:
- First approach to address overfitting from prompt length and sophistication differences across modalities
- Token-wise framework allows incorporating CLIP knowledge in a prompt-wise manner to boost generalization 
- Adaptation encourages alignment of V-L representations
- Achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods, especially on domain shift datasets
- Shows robustness and favorable performance in prompt length experiments with clear advantage in adopting V-L models

In summary, the paper proposes a novel token-wise adaptive learning framework called APLe that handles key challenges in multi-modal prompt learning for V-L models to attain excellent generalization capability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a token-wise adaptive framework for multi-modal prompt learning (APLe) that trains vision and language prompts sequentially while incorporating CLIP's zero-shot knowledge and adapts the prompts to promote modality collaboration, aiming to improve generalization capability and address overfitting risks from prompt settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing the token-wise adaptive framework for multi-modal prompt learning (APLe) to address challenges in adopting vision-language models. Specifically:

1) It proposes a token-wise knowledge training framework that allows prompt learning for both visual and language modalities sequentially and independently. This helps mitigate issues like overfitting and knowledge conflicts between modalities. 

2) It introduces a multi-modal token adaptation method after the token-wise training to promote synergy and collaboration between the learned visual and language prompts. This further improves generalization capability.

3) Experiments show APLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably it demonstrates better robustness and stability across varying prompt lengths. The framework also leads to advantages in datasets with domain shifts.

In summary, the key innovation is the token-wise training and adaptation approach for multi-modal prompt learning to address challenges faced when adopting vision-language models. This leads to a model with excellent comprehensive generalization capability.
