# [Multimodal Group Emotion Recognition In-the-wild Using Privacy-Compliant   Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Group-level emotion recognition in natural, uncontrolled environments ("in the wild") is challenging due to various factors like group dynamics, individual behaviors, etc.
- Privacy concerns around using individual facial or audio features.

Proposed Solution:
- A multimodal neural network architecture with video and audio branches to perform privacy-compliant group emotion recognition.
- Video branch: Fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) model operating on global image features.
- Audio branch: Mel-spectrogram input processed through CNN blocks and then a Transformer encoder.  
- Addition of cross-attention mechanism between branches.
- Augmentation with synthetic training data - videos with class-related facial expressions over random backgrounds and associated sounds.

Key Contributions:
- Privacy-compliant model using only global image and audio features, avoiding any individual facial or speech characteristics.
- Validation of proposed model on VGAF emotion recognition dataset, exploring impact of different input combinations.
- Best accuracy of 79.24% on validation set and 75.13% on hidden test set, competitive given privacy constraints.
- Analysis shows computer vision techniques effective for video branch but scope for improvement in audio processing.
- Demonstrates feasibility of privacy-compliant group emotion recognition with minimal data, using only 5 uniformly sampled frames per video.

In summary, the paper presents a privacy-aware multimodal approach for group emotion recognition in uncontrolled settings, with empirical analysis illustrating promise despite intentionally avoiding individual identifying information.
