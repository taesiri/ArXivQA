# [Multi-level Reasoning for Robotic Assembly: From Sequence Inference to   Contact Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the complex problem of automating the assembly of objects from their constituent parts. This requires robots to master several skills including understanding part geometries, reasoning about physical interactions, planning assembly sequences, coordinating part trajectories, identifying contact points, and physical execution. Prior works have limitations in generalizability, scalability, or efficiency.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents a holistic multi-level framework for robotic part assembly planning consisting of:

1. Part Assembly Sequence Inference: A sequence-to-sequence neural network called Part Assembly Sequence Transformer (PAST) is proposed to infer feasible assembly sequences in an autoregressive manner based on target blueprints and part geometries. 

2. Part Motion Planning: Rapidly-exploring Random Trees are used to generate collision-free trajectories for each part from its initial pose to the assembled pose based on the inferred sequence.

3. Contact Point Optimization: An efficient physics-inspired multi-scale optimization approach identifies robost contact points on the part surface to facilitate the planned motions.

The framework breaks down the complex assembly planning task into these three sub-problems and solves them sequentially. To train PAST, a large-scale dataset called D4PAS is introduced, consisting of thousands of physically valid assembly sequences for industrial objects, generated using parallelized simulations.

Main Contributions:

- Presents the first neural approach to learn part assembly sequences in a self-supervised manner based on 3D geometry

- Introduces PAST transformer that generalizes to diverse and practical blueprints 

- Provides D4PAS benchmark dataset with enumerated sequences and contact points for training and evaluation

- Achieves assembly planning with higher accuracy than prior methods, while requiring orders of magnitude less inference time

The paper sets the stage for future works on end-to-end learning of robotic assembly by contributing data, models and analysis on part sequences, motions and contacts. Limitations include assuming sequential part movements and ideal state estimation.
