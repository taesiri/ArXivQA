## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (Dynamic NeRFs) enhance NeRFs to model dynamic scenes. However, they struggle with complexity, scalability, and streamability. Recent plane-based representations like K-Planes have shown promise for modelling dynamics but still face limitations in training speed, performance, interpretability and ability to compress models. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes WavePlanes, the first wavelet-based plane representation for modelling dynamic scenes. Key ideas:

1) Represent the 4D space-time volume using multi-scale 2D wavelet coefficients stored on feature planes. Allows compact representation by exploiting coefficient sparsity.

2) Propose modifications to fusion schemes and regularizers from prior work to enhance training speed, compression ability, and interpretability. 

3) Novel compression scheme that uses hard thresholding and hash maps to achieve state-of-the-art 15x compression, storing only significant wavelet coefficients.

Main Contributions:

1) A fast and compact wavelet-based model for dynamic scenes that achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art with just 1 hour of training and model size of 12MB.

2) New regularizers: spatial smoothness over time (SST) directly on wavelet coefficients and zero-agreement schemes for fusion that aid interpretation.

3) 15x compression over other plane models using wavelet sparsity, allowing practical streaming applications.

Overall, WavePlanes advances dynamic scene modeling by offering an efficient wavelet-based plane formulation with enhanced compression and interpretability compared to prior works. The model is fast, compact and achieves strong quantitative results.
