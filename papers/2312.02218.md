# [WavePlanes: A compact Wavelet representation for Dynamic Neural Radiance   Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02218)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (Dynamic NeRFs) enhance NeRFs to model dynamic scenes. However, they struggle with complexity, scalability, and streamability. Recent plane-based representations like K-Planes have shown promise for modelling dynamics but still face limitations in training speed, performance, interpretability and ability to compress models. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes WavePlanes, the first wavelet-based plane representation for modelling dynamic scenes. Key ideas:

1) Represent the 4D space-time volume using multi-scale 2D wavelet coefficients stored on feature planes. Allows compact representation by exploiting coefficient sparsity.

2) Propose modifications to fusion schemes and regularizers from prior work to enhance training speed, compression ability, and interpretability. 

3) Novel compression scheme that uses hard thresholding and hash maps to achieve state-of-the-art 15x compression, storing only significant wavelet coefficients.

Main Contributions:

1) A fast and compact wavelet-based model for dynamic scenes that achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art with just 1 hour of training and model size of 12MB.

2) New regularizers: spatial smoothness over time (SST) directly on wavelet coefficients and zero-agreement schemes for fusion that aid interpretation.

3) 15x compression over other plane models using wavelet sparsity, allowing practical streaming applications.

Overall, WavePlanes advances dynamic scene modeling by offering an efficient wavelet-based plane formulation with enhanced compression and interpretability compared to prior works. The model is fast, compact and achieves strong quantitative results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 WavePlanes proposes a fast, compact, and compressible 4D explicit representation for dynamic neural radiance fields using wavelet-based feature planes and improved regularization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A wavelet-based plane representation for modelling dynamic scenes as explicit 4-D volumes; offering a compressible and fast model capable of competing with the state-of-the-art.

2. New regularizers for plane-based approaches.

3. A novel compression scheme that achieves state-of-the-art model size.

4. Alternative feature fusion schemes with more interpretability and comparable performance to prior schemes.

In summary, the paper proposes a new dynamic scene representation using wavelets that is highly compressible, fast, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. It also introduces new regularizers and feature fusion methods specifically for this representation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using wavelets as a basis for a 4D decomposed plane representation of dynamic scenes. What are the key benefits of using a wavelet representation over other representations like Fourier transforms? How does it lead to better compressibility?

2. The paper shifts the reconstructed space-time features by +1 prior to feature fusion. What is the motivation behind this design choice? How does it help preserve sparsity in the wavelet representation and enable compression? 

3. The paper proposes modifications to the time smoothness and time sparsity regularizers used in prior work on plane-based models. What changes were made and why? How do they lead to improved performance and reduced training times?

4. Explain the zero-agreement masked multiplication (ZMM) and zero-agreement masked addition (ZAM) feature fusion schemes proposed in the paper. How do they differ from prior hard parameter fusion schemes? What advantages do they offer?

5. The compression scheme in the paper exploits sparsity of wavelet coefficients using hard thresholding and hash maps. Walk through the steps involved and explain why this leads to a compressed model size of only 12 MB.

6. The paper investigates the impact of different wavelet families and decomposition levels on model performance and training time. Summarize the key findings. What choices work best and why?

7. Explain the motivation behind using spatial smoothness in time (SST) regularization instead of time smoothness regularization as used in prior work. How does SST lead to better performance on scenes with rapid motion changes?

8. What changes were made to the time sparsity regularizer compared to prior work? How does it help reduce training time by operating directly on the wavelet coefficients?

9. The paper proposes using a learned color basis instead of spherical harmonics for the feature decoder. What advantage does this offer? Does it help overcome limitations of SH-based decoding?

10. The compression performance varies across scenes. What scene characteristics lead to the biggest compression ratios? What types of scenes make compression less effective? How could the scheme be improved?
