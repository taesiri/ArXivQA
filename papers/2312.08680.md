# [Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08680)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents GHGNAS, a novel heterogeneous graph neural architecture search (HGNAS) method that leverages the powerful text generation capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. The key idea is to design a specialized prompt that guides GPT-4 to iteratively generate new neural architectures suited for heterogeneous graph learning tasks. The prompt encodes details on the task, dataset, search space, search strategy, and performance feedback. By incorporating feedback on the accuracy of generated architectures, GHGNAS can direct GPT-4 to explore better architectures over multiple iterations. Experiments across academic citation and recommendation datasets demonstrate that GHGNAS discovers architectures that consistently outperform both manually designed HGNNs and previous HGNAS techniques based on reinforcement learning or differentiable search. A key advantage of GHGNAS is significantly improved search efficiency and stability owing to GPT-4's strong generalization. By alleviating the need for expertise in constructing search spaces and algorithms, GHGNAS represents an important step toward more automated, performant HGNAS powered by large language models.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) are effective at modeling complex relationships in heterogeneous graphs. However, manually designing optimal HGNN architectures requires substantial expertise. 
- Existing heterogeneous graph neural architecture search (HGNAS) methods based on reinforcement learning or differentiable algorithms have limitations like inefficient search, unstable performance, and reliance on random seeds.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new HGNAS method called GHGNAS that leverages the text generation capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. 
- GHGNAS designs a new set of prompts to guide GPT-4 to generate, validate and iteratively improve HGNN architectures for a given heterogeneous graph and task.

Key Points:
- The prompts include task/data descriptions, search space specifics, exploration/optimization strategies and accuracy feedback. They enable GPT-4 to adapt to the neural architecture search task.
- In the exploration stage, GHGNAS asks GPT-4 to sample diverse architectures. In the optimization stage, it asks GPT-4 to analyze and improve on the best architectures. 
- Experiments show GHGNAS finds better architectures than prior HGNAS methods, customized HGNNs, and supervised GNNs - demonstrating improved search efficiency and accuracy.
- Ablations highlight the utility of the different prompt components. GHGNAS also provides interpretability by eliciting architecture optimization rationale from GPT-4.

Main Contributions:
- First work to demonstrate that large language models like GPT-4 can be leveraged for heterogeneous graph neural architecture search
- Design of a new set of prompts tailored to guide GPT-4 for the HGNAS task
- GHGNAS method that interacts with GPT-4 to efficiently search and optimize HGNN architectures 
- Superior performance over prior HGNAS techniques and supervised/custom GNNs
