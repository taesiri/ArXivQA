# [Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08680)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents GHGNAS, a novel heterogeneous graph neural architecture search (HGNAS) method that leverages the powerful text generation capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. The key idea is to design a specialized prompt that guides GPT-4 to iteratively generate new neural architectures suited for heterogeneous graph learning tasks. The prompt encodes details on the task, dataset, search space, search strategy, and performance feedback. By incorporating feedback on the accuracy of generated architectures, GHGNAS can direct GPT-4 to explore better architectures over multiple iterations. Experiments across academic citation and recommendation datasets demonstrate that GHGNAS discovers architectures that consistently outperform both manually designed HGNNs and previous HGNAS techniques based on reinforcement learning or differentiable search. A key advantage of GHGNAS is significantly improved search efficiency and stability owing to GPT-4's strong generalization. By alleviating the need for expertise in constructing search spaces and algorithms, GHGNAS represents an important step toward more automated, performant HGNAS powered by large language models.
