# [GraspXL: Generating Grasping Motions for Diverse Objects at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19649)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating robotic hand grasping motions that precisely achieve multiple objectives such as desired grasp position, hand orientation, wrist rotation etc. is challenging. 
- Existing methods either lack control over multiple objectives or rely on slow optimization procedures to generate static grasping poses as references.

Method:
- Proposes an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to directly synthesize dynamic grasping motions that satisfy multiple objectives.  
- Uses a hierarchical policy that first predicts a guiding pose to reach the target grasp location, then controls the fingers for stable grasping while achieving other objectives.
- Employs a curriculum-based training strategy and distance-based state features to facilitate learning.

Experiments:
- Comprehensively evaluates on ShapeNet, PartNet and Objaverse datasets with diverse metrics. Outperforms optimization and PD control baselines.
- Generalizes to reconstructed, generated, and unseen objects of varying scales.  
- Transfers effectively to different robotic hand models with various morphologies.

Contributions:  
- First end-to-end approach to generate multi-objective grasping motions.
- Achieves better performance and efficiency compared to optimization/control baselines.
- Demonstrates strong generalization across objects, scales and hand models.
- Provides useful insights via detailed ablations and analysis.

The summary covers the key details of the problem being solved, the proposed learning-based solution, experiments showing superiority over baselines, and extensive generalization tests. It also highlights the main contributions around end-to-end synthesis, performance, generalization ability and analysis.
