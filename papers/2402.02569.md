# [On the Complexity of Finite-Sum Smooth Optimization under the   Polyak-Łojasiewicz Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02569)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper studies the finite-sum optimization problem of minimizing the average of $n$ smooth functions under the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition. Specifically, it considers the problem $\min_{\vx\in\mathbb{R}^d} f(\vx) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(\vx)$, where each $f_i$ is smooth and $f$ satisfies the PL condition $f(\vx) - f^* \leq \frac{1}{2\mu}\|\nabla f(\vx)\|^2$. The goal is to find an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution that achieves $f(\vx) - f^* \leq \epsilon$. 

The paper analyzes the incremental first-order oracle (IFO) complexity, which counts the number of individual function and gradient evaluations, for this problem in both centralized and decentralized settings. In the decentralized setting, the $f_i$'s are allocated to $n$ agents connected over a network. The paper provides lower complexity bounds and nearly matching algorithmic upper bounds.

Main Contributions:

1. Provides an IFO lower complexity bound of $\Omega(n + \kappa\sqrt{n}\log(1/\epsilon))$, where $\kappa=L/\mu$ is the condition number, nearly matching existing algorithmic upper bounds. 

2. Provides decentralized lower complexity bounds of $\Omega(\kappa/\sqrt{\gamma}\log(1/\epsilon))$, $\Omega((\kappa+\tau\kappa/\sqrt{\gamma})\log(1/\epsilon))$, and $\Omega(n+\kappa\sqrt{n}\log(1/\epsilon))$ on the number of communication rounds, runtime, and IFO calls respectively, where $\gamma$ and $\tau$ capture network properties.

3. Proposes a decentralized algorithm called DRONE with nearly matching upper complexity bounds to the decentralized lower bounds in expectation. DRONE is based on Chebyshev accelerated gradient tracking and uses a stochastic recursive gradient estimator.

The lower bounds demonstrate the near optimality of existing methods and algorithms like DRONE. The upper and lower bounds provide a clear picture on the optimal complexity of solving the finite-sum PL optimization problem.
