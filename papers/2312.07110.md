# [LLMs Perform Poorly at Concept Extraction in Cyber-security Research   Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07110)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors evaluate the use of large language models (LLMs) for entity extraction and comparison in computer science literature, specifically focusing on the cybersecurity domain. They test a variety of LLM-based and non-LLM-based entity extractors on a dataset of arXiv cybersecurity papers. The results show that LLM extractors perform very similarly due to reusing base models and datasets, and are not well-suited for scientific literature as they rely on general news datasets for fine-tuning. The authors find that even assuming relevance of extracted terms, downstream processing with embeddings is highly sensitive to the choice of algorithm. They argue that current LLM pipelines are ill-suited for concept-oriented bibliometrics. As an alternative approach, they develop a compound noun extractor using statistical analysis to retrieve relevant cybersecurity terms. Although still having some limitations, this method shows promise for tracking emerging technology trends. Overall, the paper calls into question LLM usage for entity extraction in academic literature and suggests future research directions for better scientific literature analysis tools.
