# [RoboCertProb: Property Specification for Probabilistic RoboChart Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new property specification language called RoboCertProb for specifying both qualitative and quantitative properties of probabilistic robotics software models defined in RoboChart, a domain-specific language for model-based development of robotics software. 

The key problem addressed in the paper is that existing property specification languages like PCTL* require expertise in formal methods, making them difficult for robotics engineers to use directly. Also, they do not integrate well with high-level modeling languages like RoboChart. 

To address this, the authors design RoboCertProb as a controlled natural language that allows specifying properties in terms of elements of the RoboChart models themselves. To give semantics to RoboCertProb for RoboChart models, the authors first define a Markov semantics for RoboChart in terms of discrete-time Markov chains (DTMCs) and Markov decision processes (MDPs). This Markov semantics is consistent with the existing semantics of RoboChart given via a translation to the PRISM language.

Based on the Markov semantics of RoboChart, the semantics of RoboCertProb is given in terms of PCTL*, a probabilistic computation tree logic that can specify both qualitative and quantitative properties.

The key features of RoboCertProb include:

- References to RoboChart model elements using fully qualified names
- Configuration of loose constants in RoboChart models 
- Definitions of unspecified functions/operations
- Environment modeling using additional PRISM modules
- Probabilistic property specification using PCTL* operators
- Statistical model checking configuration

The authors implement RoboCertProb as a plug-in in the RoboTool framework, leveraging Xtext for modeling, validation and automatic code generation. RoboCertProb properties can be automatically compiled into PRISM code for verification of RoboChart models.

The authors demonstrate the use of RoboCertProb for verification of a simple random walk model, an industrial robot controller model, and a UV light treatment robot model. The case studies validate that RoboCertProb provides an accessible property specification mechanism tailored for robotics engineers using RoboChart models.

In summary, the key contributions are:

(a) A PCTL* based property language RoboCertProb integrated with RoboChart robotics modeling language
(b) Markov semantics for RoboChart enabling interpretation of RoboCertProb
(c) Tool support within RoboTool framework for RoboCertProb
(d) Case studies demonstrating applicability for robotics verification
