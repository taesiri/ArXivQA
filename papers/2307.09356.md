# [OnlineRefer: A Simple Online Baseline for Referring Video Object   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09356)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can an online model perform well for referring video object segmentation compared to complex offline models?The key points are:- Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object in a video based on a natural language expression. Current state-of-the-art methods are offline, processing the video clip-by-clip independently. - The authors challenge the belief that offline models are necessary for good RVOS performance. They propose OnlineRefer, a simple and effective online baseline using query propagation across frames.- OnlineRefer contains two main components: 1) Query-based referring segmentation to predict target outputs like box, mask, category per frame based on input queries. 2) Cross-frame query propagation to update the outputs as queries for the next frame.- Without bells and whistles, OnlineRefer achieves state-of-the-art results on Refer-Youtube-VOS, Refer-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences benchmarks, outperforming prior complex offline models.In summary, the central hypothesis is that an online model can achieve strong performance for RVOS, challenging the notion that offline processing is required. OnlineRefer is proposed to validate this hypothesis through its simple yet effective online pipeline. The impressive results demonstrate the potential of online models versus complex offline methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing OnlineRefer, an online referring video object segmentation framework based on query propagation. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Challenging the common belief that only offline models can handle referring video object segmentation well, and showing that a simple online model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. - Proposing an online baseline consisting of two main components: query-based referring segmentation and cross-frame query propagation. The query-based segmentation outputs embeddings and masks of the referred object. The propagation updates these outputs as queries for the next frame to achieve association.- Developing a semi-online extension to make the framework compatible with video-based backbones for extracting spatio-temporal features. - Conducting comprehensive experiments on 4 benchmarks - Refer-Youtube-VOS, Refer-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, JHMDB-Sentences. The online model outperforms previous offline methods by a large margin.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a novel and effective online baseline for referring video object segmentation via query propagation, which challenges the necessity of complex offline modeling. The online framework is simple yet strong, achieving new state-of-the-art on multiple datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper proposes OnlineRefer, a simple and effective online baseline for referring video object segmentation. It breaks the common belief that only offline models can handle this task well, and achieves state-of-the-art performance by propagating target information frame-by-frame for explicit cross-frame association.
