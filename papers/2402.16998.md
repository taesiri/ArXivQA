# [What Do Language Models Hear? Probing for Auditory Representations in   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16998)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates whether language models trained solely on text corpora can encode grounded knowledge about the sounds of objects, without having access to any explicit sound data during training. Specifically, the authors probe whether the vector representations of objects in language models have structural similarities with vector representations of the sounds of those objects from separately trained audio models.

Methodology: 
The authors first do a preliminary qualitative analysis using Procrustes analysis to align vector spaces of text representations and sound representations of the same set of objects. This shows some structural similarities, motivating a more rigorous quantitative analysis. 

The main analysis involves training a contrastive probe on a training set of objects to align their text and sound representations. The probe applies linear projections to both spaces and optimizes their similarity via a contrastive loss. If this probe generalizes to a held-out set of unseen objects, it suggests the text and sound spaces have inherent structural commonalities that facilitate the mapping between them.

The authors experiment with various language models (BERT, GPT-2 etc.) and audio models (AudioMAE, PaSST etc.). The audio models are all pretrained without access to symbolic text. Some audio models are supervised on sound classification while others are purely self-supervised.

Key Results:
- The probe generalizes significantly above chance across most language and audio model combinations, even on held-out objects not seen during training. This suggests language models learn grounded knowledge about the sounds of objects despite training on just text.

- Probe performance is better when using auditory-aligned sound representations from audio models pretrained on sound classification, compared to purely acoustic representations from self-supervised models.

- Analysis shows certain categories of sounds like instruments and human speech are better encoded in language models.

Overall, the paper provides evidence that language models can learn surprisingly grounded representations, acquiring knowledge about concepts like sounds which they have no explicit access to during training. The paper also analyses what kinds of auditory knowledge is better learned by language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper probes language models trained on text to see if they encode grounded knowledge of sounds of objects, finding that linear transformations can often retrieve the correct text representation from a sound representation with above-chance accuracy, even generalizing to unseen object classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is probing language models trained on raw text to see if they encode grounded knowledge about the sounds of objects. Specifically, the authors learn linear transformations to align language representations of objects with sound representations of those same objects from pretrained audio models. They find that the probes are able to generalize to unseen object classes, indicating that despite being trained on just text, language models learn representations that structurally resemble auditory representations of objects. This provides evidence that language models can acquire grounded knowledge about the world from statistical patterns in text alone.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Language models - The paper explores whether language models trained on just text encode grounded knowledge about sounds.

- Probing - The method used involves probing language models by learning alignments between text and sound representations.

- Auditory representations - The paper investigates whether language models learn auditory (human perception-like) representations of sounds.

- Contrastive probe - A contrastive loss is used to align text and sound representations in a common embedding space.

- Generalization - A key evaluation is whether the learned probe can generalize to unseen object classes.

- Grounding - The paper relates to the broader question of whether and how language models can learn grounded knowledge. 

- Meaning - The extent to which language models encode auditory knowledge has implications for whether they learn some form of meaning.

- Encoder models - Language models tested include BERT, T5, GPT-2.

- Audio models - Audio representations come from models like AudioMAE, PaSST, PANN.

In summary, key terms cover probing methodology, types of representations, language and audio models used, and connections to grounding and meaning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes learning linear transformations (i.e. projection heads) between language and sound representations using a contrastive loss. What are some potential limitations of using linear transformations, and how could more complex alignments be explored?

2. The contrastive loss used pushes text and audio representations to be close in cosine distance for the same object. How sensitive is performance to the choice of distance/similarity metric? Could semantic similarity metrics be explored? 

3. The paper finds supervised audio models (e.g. finetuned AudioMAE) lead to better alignment than self-supervised models. What explanations are proposed for this? Does this provide any insight on whether language models are encoding more acoustic or auditory representations?

4. The paper argues above-chance probe generalization suggests structural similarities between language and sound spaces. But what alternative explanations could there be for the above-chance performance? How thoroughly were these explored? 

5. Accuracy@3 is used as the main evaluation metric. How sensitive are the conclusions to the choice of K? Could mean rank also be reported to give a fuller picture?

6. The paper studies generalization to unseen classes, but are there any issues regarding generalization to entirely new datasets not discussed? Could the probes be overfitting dataset-specific artifacts? 

7. The language representations are derived from simple templated sentences. How could more naturalistic sentences be used instead? What challenges would this introduce?

8. The contrastive loss objective depends heavily on sampling good negative examples. What analysis is provided on the negative samples chosen and their impact on learning?

9. The paper studies aligning object-level representations. How difficult would it be to scale this approach to align sound and language spaces at a finer conceptual granularity?

10. The paper argues language models encode grounded knowledge without explicit grounding. But to what extent could the language models still be implicitly encoding biases that facilitate grounding-style learning?
