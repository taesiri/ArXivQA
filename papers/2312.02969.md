# [Rank-without-GPT: Building GPT-Independent Listwise Rerankers on   Open-Source Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02969)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores building effective listwise neural passage rerankers without relying on GPT models. Listwise rerankers directly predict the ranking of a list of passages based on relevance to a query in one pass. Prior work has depended on GPT models, creating a single point of failure. This work shows for the first time that a listwise reranker based on the open-source Code-LLaMA model can outperform rerankers based on GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, and achieve 97% effectiveness of GPT-4-based rerankers. However, experiments find that current IR training data designed for pointwise ranking is insufficient for training listwise models, indicating that higher quality listwise ranking data is crucial. Overall, this work advocates for more diverse solutions in building listwise rerankers beyond reliance on GPT models. It also calls for future work on constructing human-annotated datasets specifically for the purpose of listwise ranking. The results show listwise ranking is promising but may be bounded by current training data quality rather than model capacity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes and evaluates listwise rerankers for passage retrieval based on open-source large language models without relying on GPT models, showing competitive performance to GPT-based listwise rerankers and the importance of high-quality listwise training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It shows for the first time that effective listwise rerankers can be built without any dependency on GPT models. The best listwise reranker presented surpasses those based on GPT-3.5 by 13% and achieves 97% effectiveness of rerankers based on GPT-4.

2) It finds that the quality of the training data, specifically the quality of the rankings, is crucial for training good listwise rerankers. Current IR training data designed for pointwise ranking is insufficient. Higher quality, human-annotated listwise data would likely further improve performance.  

3) It demonstrates that listwise reranker fine-tuning does not require huge amounts of data. An effective reranker can be built with only 5k queries, each with a ranked list of 20 passages. This shows it may be feasible to build a human-annotated listwise dataset.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that effective listwise rerankers can be developed without reliance on GPT models, using alternative open-source LLMs. The paper also analyzes data needs and quality considerations for training such models.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Listwise reranking
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Text retrieval 
- Passage reranking
- Ranking quality
- Training data  
- GPT models
- Scientific reproducibility
- Open-source models
- Query latency
- Sliding window strategy

The paper introduces the concept of listwise rerankers based on large language models, which directly output a re-ranked list of passages given a query, instead of scoring documents independently. It shows how to build effective listwise rerankers without relying on proprietary GPT models, using open-source LLMs instead. Key findings include the importance of high-quality training data for ranking, and issues like query latency. The work aims to diversify solutions for passage reranking beyond just GPT models, and integrate retrieval into the text-to-text framework.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that current research findings on listwise reranking may only apply to GPT models and not general LLMs. How does the proposed method in this paper address this limitation? What evidence does it provide that listwise reranking can work on non-GPT LLMs?

3. How does the paper investigate the impact of training data quality on listwise reranker performance? What trends does it uncover regarding the relationship between data quality and model effectiveness? 

4. What techniques does the paper use to generate silver ranking training data of different quality levels? How do choices like BM25, Contriever, and Cohere rerank differ in terms of ranking capacity?

5. What range of model sizes are examined for the listwise rerankers? Is there evidence that effectiveness increases with model scale? If so, does effectiveness plateau at a certain model size or show potential for further improvement?  

6. How competitive is the best listwise reranker from this paper compared to prior state-of-the-art GPT-based listwise rerankers? Does it surpass rerankers based on certain GPT model sizes?

7. What analysis does the paper provide regarding the sliding window strategy for applying listwise reranking to passage lists longer than the model's max input length? What trends does it uncover?

8. How does the paper evaluate generalization of the trained listwise rerankers to out-of-domain datasets? What issues does it encounter and what future work does it propose to address them?

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work has shown that listwise neural rerankers, which rank a list of passages jointly based on a query, achieve state-of-the-art results in passage retrieval. However, existing listwise rerankers depend exclusively on GPT models, raising concerns around reproducibility and whether the findings generalize beyond GPT.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper proposes the first effective listwise neural rerankers that are completely independent of GPT models. The rerankers are based on the open-source Code-LLaMA language model.

- Experiments fine-tune and evaluate listwise rerankers of varying sizes (7B, 13B, 34B parameters) on the TREC-DL passage ranking datasets.

Key Findings:
- The best GPT-independent listwise reranker substantially outperforms prior GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 based rerankers, and performs on par with GPT-4 based rerankers. This demonstrates GPT is not a requirement for effective listwise ranking.

- The quality of the training data, specifically the quality of the passage rankings, is crucial for listwise reranker performance. Higher quality rankings enable better performance. This indicates potential value in human-annotated listwise training data.

- An effective listwise reranker can be trained with a modest 5K queries, showing fine-tuning data requirements are reasonable.

Main Contributions:
- First listwise neural rerankers that match or exceed GPT-based models without any GPT dependency, proving GPT is not a requirement.

- Identifies quality and quantity of listwise training data as a key factor limiting listwise reranker performance, motivating construction of human-annotated listwise datasets.

- Opens opportunities for more diverse and integratable listwise ranking models by alleviating exclusive GPT dependency.
