# [Solving Data-centric Tasks using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like Codex and GPT-3 are gaining popularity for generating code from natural language. However, they struggle with data-centric tasks that require manipulating tabular data, since it's unclear how much data context needs to be provided.  

- Simply passing the entire data table is impractical. But passing no data or limited data fails to convey the syntactic variations that allow the model to generalize.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a "cluster-then-select" prompting technique to pass representative data rows. First it clusters input rows by syntactic similarity using regex patterns. Then it selects rows covering the top clusters.

- This is evaluated on a new dataset (\sof) of 201 real-world NL-to-code data manipulation tasks collected from Stack Overflow.

Main Contributions:  
- \sof dataset of complex data-centric tasks with expected output to evaluate LLMs

- Analysis showing LLMs are sensitive to quantity and choice of data rows passed 

- Cluster-then-select prompting technique to pick representative rows from large data tables

- Experiments on \sof and larger tables showing the technique improves performance by capturing syntactic variations compared to random selection

In summary, the paper demonstrates the importance of smart data prompting when generating programs from NL with LLMs, and introduces both a novel dataset and selection technique to make progress on this challenging problem.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new dataset of complex data-centric programming tasks mined from Stack Overflow and a cluster-then-select prompting technique to select representative input data rows when prompting large language models to generate solutions for such tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A new dataset called \sof of real-world data-centric tasks mined from StackOverflow posts, equipped with natural language queries and small input tables.

2) A "cluster-then-select" prompting technique that clusters the input rows based on their syntactic structure, selects representative rows from each cluster, and adds those rows to the prompt passed to the LLM.

3) An analysis showing that LLM performance on data-centric tasks is sensitive to the amount and choice of data rows passed in the prompt. Specifically:
- Performance improves when more data rows are provided compared to no data
- The cluster-then-select technique outperforms random selection of rows when the input table has high syntactic variation

So in summary, the main contributions are a new benchmark dataset, a novel prompting technique, and an empirical analysis characterizing the impact of data on LLM code generation for data-centric tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on using large pre-trained language models like GPT-4 and CodeLlama for generating code solutions to data-centric tasks.

- Data-centric tasks: The tasks involve manipulating tabular data, like spreadsheets, to generate new columns based on computations on existing columns. 

- Prompting techniques: Different techniques for prompting the LLMs with the right data context from large tables, like the proposed "cluster-then-select" method.

- Representative rows: Selecting the most representative rows from the input table to include in the prompt using clustering.

- Syntactic variation: Capturing the variation in formats/patterns across different rows of the input table. 

- Generalization: Ensuring the LLM generated solutions generalize across all rows, not just the rows seen in the prompt.

- SofSet dataset: The new dataset of StackOverflow data-centric tasks created and used for evaluation.

- Pass@k metric: Probability of getting at least one correct solution out of k samples. Used to evaluate model performance.

- Sensitivity analysis: Analyzing model performance with increasing amounts of data passed in the prompts.

In summary, the key focus is on using LLMs for data-centric tasks by developing better prompting techniques using representative data samples.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The cluster-then-select prompting technique clusters input rows based on syntactic structure. How sensitive is this approach to the specific clustering algorithm used? Could using a different clustering method lead to better or worse performance? 

2. When selecting representative rows from clusters, the paper frames it as a weighted maximal coverage problem. What impact would using a different selection strategy from clusters have on model performance?

3. The paper evaluates the cluster-then-select approach on data-dependent tasks only. Could this technique also be beneficial for data-independent or external-dependent tasks? What changes would need to be made?

4. The technique is evaluated on tasks with tabular string data as input. How well would it transfer to other data types like numbers, dates, categories etc? Would any modifications be needed?

5. The representative rows are directly concatenated to the textual query to create the prompt. Could a different prompting format better convey the connection between the query and data examples?

6. The validation criteria allow some variation between expected and actual output formats. Is there a risk of incorrect solutions being classified as correct? How could validation be improved?  

7. The paper generates multiple completions and filters based on validity. How sensitive are the results to the specific parameters around completion generation and filtering?

8. The cluster-then-select approach improved over random selection but is not compared to other data selection strategies. What are some promising alternatives worth exploring?

9. The technique relies on FlashProfile for clustering. How would results differ if using an unsupervised ML model for clustering instead? What are the tradeoffs?

10. The approach is evaluated on a newly introduced dataset based on StackOverflow. How well would the conclusions transfer if tested on other diverse real-world datasets?
