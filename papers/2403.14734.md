## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey of Neural Code Intelligence: Paradigms, Advances and Beyond":

Problem:
Neural code intelligence, which applies neural networks to understand, generate and manipulate code, has become an important research area spanning natural language processing, software engineering and beyond. However, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive review of this fast-evolving field.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper provides a chronological review of neural code intelligence, following its progression through three key phases: 
1) Neural language models for code based on RNNs and CNNs to model code snippets as text. 
2) Code pre-trained models (CodePTMs) based on Transformer architecture pre-trained on large unlabeled code corpora like CodeSearchNet and fine-tuned for downstream tasks.  
3) Large language models for code (CodeLLMs) which are decoder-only, autoregressive transformers scaling to billions of parameters and trained on massive code datasets.

Main Contributions:
1) Traces paradigm shifts in models, tasks and applications across the three phases. Highlights key models like code2vec, CodeBERT, CodeT5, CodeLLaMA etc.

2) Comprehensively reviews tasks, datasets and metrics. Discusses shift from match-based to execution-based evaluation for code generation.

3) Explores synergies with other domains like reasoning through program-aided LMs, enhancing mathematical abilities via code training. Also alternative use of code for tackling NLP tasks.

4) Reviews real-world applications like coding assistants, data science automation, building AI agents and accelerating scientific research.

5) Discusses limitations, opportunities and promising future directions regarding efficient training, robust evaluation, incorporating structural information into CodeLLMs among others.

In summary, this paper provides a holistic review of neural code intelligence, analyzing the developmental trajectory of the field and laying a strong foundation to guide future research.
