# [Think2Drive: Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Thinking in Latent   World Model for Quasi-Realistic Autonomous Driving (in CARLA-v2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16720)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Autonomous driving, especially in complex urban environments, requires handling both regular driving tasks as well as a multitude of corner cases. Existing driving simulators like CARLA v1 have limited diversity and complexity of scenarios. 
- The newly released CARLA v2 adds 39 challenging corner cases representing real-world driving situations. However, due to the difficulty, no existing methods have succeeded in CARLA v2.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Think2Drive, the first model-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach for autonomous driving. 
- It uses a world model to learn a latent state space representing the driving environment's dynamics. This world model acts as a fast neural simulator for the RL agent to "think" and improve its policy efficiently.

Key Contributions:
- Addresses unique challenges in using model-based RL for AD through several tailored techniques: policy resetting, automated scenario generation, priority experience replay, steering cost function.
- Achieves expert-level driving proficiency in CARLA v2, being the first to succeed in this benchmark.
- Proposes the CornerCaseRepository benchmark with metrics balancing route completion rate and infractions per km.
- The world model can accurately predict future states and provide interpretable predictions.
- Significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods like Roach.

In summary, the paper makes pioneering progress in using model-based RL for complex urban autonomous driving by proposing Think2Drive. It succeeds in the challenging CARLA v2 benchmark by addressing its unique difficulties. The world model prediction visualizations also showcase the approach's interpretability.
