# [Think before you speak: Training Language Models With Pause Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

What is the effect of training and evaluating Transformer-based language models with artificially inserted "pause" tokens, which delay the model's output prediction?

Specifically, the authors are interested in studying:

1) Whether adding these pause tokens, which provide no explicit signals but simply delay the model's output, can enhance the model's performance on various downstream NLP tasks like question answering and commonsense reasoning.

2) Whether the potential benefits arise from pause tokens inserted during pretraining, finetuning, or both stages of training. 

3) The mechanisms by which pause tokens might improve performance - for example, by allowing more complex computational pathways or temporal dynamics within the model.

The overarching hypothesis seems to be that delaying a language model's output response, if implemented properly during training, can enhance its generalization and reasoning abilities on certain tasks. The paper aims to test this through empirical studies on several Transformer architectures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a method to train language models to utilize additional computation at inference time by appending learnable "pause" tokens to the input. Specifically:

- The authors propose pausing training, which involves inserting learnable <pause> tokens at random positions during pretraining and finetuning. This allows the model to process more tokens before committing to an output. 

- They evaluate pause training on large transformer models during pretraining on C4 and finetuning on a variety of downstream tasks. 

- Their key finding is that pause training, i.e. using <pause> tokens during both pretraining and finetuning, improves performance on the majority of downstream tasks compared to standard training. The gains are especially clear for the 1B parameter model, with 18% higher EM on SQuAD QA, 8% on CommonsenseQA, etc.

- In contrast, only using the <pause> tokens during finetuning leads to smaller and less consistent gains. This suggests both stages of training are important for the model to take advantage of the extra computation from the pause tokens.

- They also analyze the effect of varying the number of pause tokens and find that each task has a different optimal amount. The models are also relatively robust to mismatches between finetuning and inference.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing pause training to allow language models to learn to benefit from additional computation at inference time, and demonstrating clear gains from this approach when applied during both pretraining and task finetuning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes training language models to pause and think before generating an output, by inserting learnable "pause" tokens during pretraining and finetuning, which improves performance on downstream tasks like question answering and reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some ways this paper on training language models with pause tokens compares to other related research:

- Using dummy tokens/pauses to extend computation in Transformers has been explored before, but this paper shows that introducing pauses during both pretraining and finetuning leads to performance gains on a variety of downstream tasks. Previous work like Chain of Thought and studies on memory tokens only used pauses during inference. 

- The idea of delaying or extending computation before a model makes predictions relates to other techniques like deliberation networks and self-refinement through iterative feedback. However, pause training does not change the core Transformer architecture itself. The gains come from training procedures alone.

- The gains from pause training seem to be complementary to other methods for improving reasoning in LMs like chain of thought prompting. The authors argue pause trains may better utilize the additional computation enabled by chain of thought prompts.

- Lightweight finetuning techniques also introduce new tokens, but mainly for parameter efficient tuning. Pause tokens are not meant to be parameter efficient - they expand capacity. The key innovation is using them in pretraining, unlike lightweight finetuning.

- Analyzing the effect of pretraining vs finetuning with pauses is insightful. The paper finds both are crucial for downstream gains, highlighting the value of designing tailored pretraining procedures.

- There is limited prior work studying how to make models robust to shifts in the computational budget during inference. Testing generalization across different numbers of pause tokens is a nice contribution.

In summary, this paper explores a new direction of training with deliberate delays for performance gains. The emphasis on timed pretraining is novel, as is the robustness analysis. It opens up many avenues for better understanding model computation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing a rigorous understanding of the mechanism behind how pause training leads to improved performance. The authors provide some informal intuition, but call for a formal analysis of how the additional computation pathways and delays help the model. 

- Exploring ways to make pause training more widely applicable in practice. The authors note the expense of pause pretraining as a limitation, and suggest finding ways to make pause training help even with standard pretrained models.

- Studying how the benefits of pause training generalize across more model sizes, architectures (e.g. encoder-decoder), pretraining objectives and datasets. The current empirical study is limited to decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters pretrained on C4.

- Designing pause training approaches that are robust to shifts in the number of pause tokens, including being robust to zero pause tokens at inference. The authors show current approaches degrade without any pauses.

- Using multiple different pause tokens and better ways of determining the optimal number of pause tokens for a given task.

- Understanding pause training benefits in relation to model size. The authors discuss a surprise in smaller models benefiting less, and suggest formally analyzing the interplay between model capacity and computational pathways.

- Exploring other algorithmic extensions like pausing in the middle of sequences, integrating with other techniques like self-refinement, and applications to areas like long text generation.

In summary, the authors lay out a range of conceptual and practical research directions stemming from their empirical exploration of pause training, to further develop this as a general technique for improving language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to train language models to make better use of computation by introducing "pause" tokens. The key idea is to append multiple copies of a special <pause> token to inputs during pretraining and finetuning. During inference, the model's outputs are ignored until after the last <pause> token, which allows the model extra computation time before generating its output. Empirically, the authors show that introducing pauses during both pretraining and finetuning (but not just finetuning) improves performance on several NLP tasks requiring reasoning, question answering, fact recall, etc. Compared to standard training, models trained with the proposed "pause training" approach show gains of up to 18% on extractive QA using SQuAD and 8% on commonsense reasoning using CommonsenseQA. The gains suggest that providing models additional computation via pause tokens, if implemented in both pretraining and finetuning, can enhance their capabilities. The paper opens up directions for better understanding and extending the paradigm of delayed next-token generation in language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces the idea of "pause-training" for transformer-based language models. The key idea is to append a learnable "pause" token to inputs during training and inference. This allows the model to delay its next token prediction and perform more computation before committing to an output. The authors implement pause-training in two stages - pretraining and finetuning. During pretraining, pause tokens are randomly inserted into sequences. The model is trained to predict the next real token, while losses on predicting the pause tokens are ignored. For finetuning, pauses are appended to the end of input prefixes. Again, outputs during pauses are ignored. At inference, pauses are appended and the model's prediction is delayed until after the last pause token.

The authors evaluate pause-training on 1B and 130M parameter decoder-only models. The models are pretrained on C4 data then finetuned on 9 diverse NLP datasets. They find that pause-training during both pretraining and finetuning improves performance over standard training on the majority of tasks. The gains are especially prominent for the 1B model, with 18% higher EM on SQuAD QA, 8% on CommonsenseQA, and 1% on GSM8k reasoning. Ablations show that appending pauses is better than prepending, each task benefits from an optimal number of pauses, and pause-training exhibits reasonable robustness to shifts in the inference pause length. Overall, the work demonstrates that delaying prediction by training with dummy pause tokens can enhance transformer models across several NLP tasks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a technique called "pause-training", where a special learnable pause token <pause> is inserted randomly during pretraining and appended after the input during finetuning and inference. This allows the model to process extra computation beyond the length of the input prefix before generating the next token. Specifically, the pause tokens delay the model's output generation, letting it manipulate more intermediate embeddings in each layer before committing to the next output token. This provides a wider computational pathway that could allow better representation and computation. The main experiments study four training variants: standard pretraining + finetuning, pause pretraining + standard finetuning, standard pretraining + pause finetuning, and pause pretraining + pause finetuning. The results demonstrate clear gains on a majority of downstream tasks when using pause training in both pretraining and finetuning stages, compared to standard end-to-end training. The key benefit comes from inference-time delays rather than improved representations from pause-pretraining alone. Overall, the work proposes and evaluates pause-training as a way of going beyond immediate next-token prediction in language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of the constrained computational pathways in standard transformer models for next token prediction. Specifically, in standard transformer models, the number of operations per layer used to predict the next token is limited by the number of preceding tokens. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a method of "pause training" where dummy pause tokens are inserted during pre-training and finetuning. This allows the model to have wider computational pathways for predicting the next token. The key questions explored are:

1) Does inserting these pause tokens and delaying the model's output help, hurt, or have no effect on downstream performance? 

2) Is there a difference in performance if the pauses are only inserted during pretraining, only during finetuning, or during both stages?

The paper aims to evaluate pause training on a variety of downstream tasks to determine if it can enhance the transformer's capabilities, particularly for tasks requiring reasoning, question answering, recall, and understanding. The overarching goal is to explore this new paradigm of "delayed" next token prediction in language models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes training language models with pause tokens to allow for additional computation before generating the next token. How might this approach relate to other techniques for expanding the effective "context size" that a language model can leverage, such as expanded attention windows? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages compared to those techniques?

2. The paper finds benefits to training with pause tokens during both pre-training and fine-tuning stages. What factors might explain why pause tokens are more effective when used in both stages rather than just one? Does this indicate that pause tokens fundamentally change the representations learned by the model?

3. When varying the number of pause tokens used during training, the paper finds an "optimal" number for each downstream task. What factors might determine this optimal amount of delay? Could the optimal amount be predicted automatically based on properties of the dataset?

4. The paper studies appending vs. prepending pause tokens and finds appending works better, but both help compared to no pauses. Why might the position of the pauses matter? Does this reveal anything about how self-attention handles different types of tokens?

5. The paper finds smaller models benefit less from pause tokens. Why might larger models be better able to take advantage of the additional computation enabled by pauses? Does this indicate fundamental limits of smaller models?

6. The paper studies robustness to varying the number of pause tokens at inference time, but finds models still rely heavily on some minimum number of pauses. How could training be improved to make models more robust to removing pauses entirely at inference time? 

7. The paper uses a single reusable pause token. Would using multiple different pause tokens allow more sophisticated use of delays? How should the model handle generating/predicting diverse pause tokens during training?

8. The paper studies decoder-only models. How well might this approach extend to encoder-decoder models? Would pauses be needed on only the encoder, only the decoder, or both?

9. The paper hypothesizes wider computational pathways explain the benefits. Are there other possible explanations, e.g. effectively increasing the training context size? Are there probing experiments that could isolate the source of gains?

10. The paper requires re-training models from scratch with pauses. What techniques could allow adding delays to benefit off-the-shelf pretrained models without pause tokens? Could an adapter-based approach work?
