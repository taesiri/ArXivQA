# [BundledSLAM: An Accurate Visual SLAM System Using Multiple Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Monocular and stereo visual SLAM systems have limited field of view and single orientation, negatively impacting robustness and accuracy. 
- There is a need for accurate and robust multi-camera visual SLAM system that can leverage wide field of view.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose BundledSLAM, an extension of ORB-SLAM2 for multi-camera setups. 
- It introduces "BundledFrame" to consolidate image data from all cameras and "BundledKeyframe" as basic operation unit.
- Features points from all cameras are matched and assigned unique IDs for efficient data fusion. 
- Bundle adjustment with extrinsic parameters is used for precise trajectory optimization.
- Database for place recognition searches broader scope for accurate loop closure.

Main Contributions:
- Complete multi-camera SLAM system encompassing tracking, mapping, loop closure and map reuse.
- Flexible virtual camera model through "BundledFrame" to adapt to diverse camera configurations.
- Precise trajectory estimation by optimizing extrinsic parameters between cameras.
- Enhanced accuracy compared to ORB-SLAM2 and VINS-Stereo on EuRoC dataset.

In summary, the paper proposes an extensible and accurate multi-camera SLAM system that outperforms state-of-the-art monocular systems. The virtual camera abstraction and optimization process enables robust fusion of multi-camera data for improved performance.
