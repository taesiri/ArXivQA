# [Structured state-space models are deep Wiener models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06211)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides an introduction to Structured State-Space Models (SSMs) aimed at the system identification community. SSMs have recently become popular in machine learning for tackling long sequence modeling tasks. The paper shows how SSMs can be interpreted as a way to learn deep Wiener models, where several Wiener models are interconnected in series. Each layer in an SSM consists of a linear discrete-time state-space model followed by a nonlinear function. Various parametrizations and initialization strategies for these linear state-space layers are discussed, including continuous-time and discrete-time formulations. A key benefit of SSMs is that they can be simulated efficiently in parallel across long input sequences. The paper summarizes recent SSM architectures like S4, S5, and LRU models. An example shows SSMs achieving good performance modeling the Silverbox benchmark. Finally, open research questions are highlighted around minimal structures, data-driven initialization, choice of parametrization, and more extensive benchmarking of these models for system identification problems.
