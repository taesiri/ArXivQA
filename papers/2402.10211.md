# [Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence   Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data like magnetometers and piezoresistors to predict desirable physical quantities like force and inertial measurements is an important problem with applications in robotics, medical devices etc.
- Classical model-based approaches require extensive domain expertise and modeling. They also don't handle sensor noise and drift well.
- Lack of labeled datasets makes this task more challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new benchmark called CSP-Bench with 6 real-world datasets totaling 40 hours for continuous sequence prediction tasks.
- It shows that Deep State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and Mamba outperform LSTMs and Transformers on these tasks by 10% on average.
- The paper proposes Hierarchical State Space Models (HiSS) which hierarchically combines two SSMs - one lower level that operates on small temporal chunks and outputs local features, and one higher level that operates on the sequence of local features and outputs the final prediction.

Main Contributions:
- Release of CSP-Bench, the largest publicly available benchmark for continuous sequence prediction across multiple sensor modalities
- Demonstrating SSMs outperform LSTMs and Transformers on CSP tasks
- Proposing HiSS that hierarchically combines SSMs and shows 23% lower MSE than the best flat SSMs across CSP-Bench
- Analysis showing HiSS increases sample efficiency on smaller datasets and works well with standard pre-processing like low-pass filtering

In summary, the paper addresses continuous sequence prediction tasks using sensory data through benchmarking, proposing a novel hierarchical architecture, and analysis around real-world applicability. The released benchmark and strong results of HiSS advance the state-of-the-art in this important but relatively less explored area.
