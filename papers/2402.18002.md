# [Symmetry-aware Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Assembly under Partial   Observability with a Soft Wrist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Performing contact-rich robotic assembly tasks like peg-in-hole insertion is challenging, especially when using soft robots that have complex dynamics. 
- Most prior works assume full state observability from external sensors, but this has limitations.
- Learning policies directly from partial observations is more difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the peg-in-hole task as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and use a recurrent soft actor-critic (SAC) agent
- Leverage the symmetry of the peg and hole:
   - Use data augmentation by applying rotational/reflection transformations
   - Add auxiliary losses to make actor and critic networks symmetric
- Test on 5 different symmetric peg shapes in simulation and also directly on a real robot

Main Contributions:
- Novel way to leverage domain symmetry in a POMDP to make a recurrent SAC agent sample efficient:
   - Data augmentation through group transformations
   - Auxiliary losses to enforce symmetric properties
- Simulation experiments across peg shapes show performance comparable or better than a state-based agent
- Thanks to improved sample efficiency, able to learn policies directly on a real robot in under 3 hours  
- Learned policies exhibit better performance than human demonstrations
- Policies generalize across different peg shapes in simulation and hardware

In summary, the key idea is to exploit task symmetry in a POMDP formulation to make an actor-critic agent more sample efficient for learning contact-rich assembly skills on a real robot with partial state information. The results demonstrate successful learning directly from physical interaction.
