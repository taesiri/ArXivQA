## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using calibration methods to boost the zero-shot performance of pretrained multilingual encoder models on cloze-style prompt tasks. Multilingual encoders like mBERT can perform zero-shot cross-lingual learning by predicting label words for a cloze prompt, but their performance is limited by bias towards frequent words. To address this, the authors combine calibration techniques like contextual calibration, PMI, and penalty methods with mBERT to modify the predicted label word probabilities. Experiments on sentiment, topic classification, and linguistic probing datasets show substantial gains from calibrating mBERT, especially with just a few training samples to refine the calibration parameters. The methods are analyzed across high/low resource languages and language families, indicating effectiveness varies based on language properties. Overall, the work demonstrates probability calibration significantly enhances zero-shot capabilities of multilingual encoders on diverse prompt-based tasks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using calibration methods to boost the zero-shot performance of multilingual encoder models on cross-lingual tasks. Pretrained multilingual encoders like mBERT can perform zero-shot learning on new languages by predicting label words at masked token positions in prompt-based inputs. However, the predictions are biased towards certain frequent words, limiting performance. 

To address this, the authors combine calibration techniques like context probabilities and penalty terms with mBERT to modify the predicted label probabilities. Experiments on sentiment, topic classification and linguistic probing datasets show substantial gains from calibration, especially with a small number of training samples to tune the parameters. The paper provides a useful method to improve zero-shot cross-lingual transfer with multilingual encoders.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes using calibration techniques to enhance the performance of multilingual encoder models on zero-shot cross-lingual learning. The key idea is to combine pretrained multilingual encoders like mBERT and XLM-R with different calibration methods to modify the predicted probabilities of label words. This helps alleviate the bias present in the models' predictions towards certain frequent words. 

Specifically, the authors explore methods like contextual calibration, pointwise mutual information, marginalization-based calibration, and a simple penalty-based approach. These calibration techniques are applied on top of the models' masked language modeling predictions to produce calibrated label word probabilities. Experiments on monolingual and multilingual tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach yields substantial gains over uncalibrated baselines. The paper also shows that further tuning the calibration parameters on a few training examples can provide additional improvements. Overall, the work demonstrates that probability calibration is an effective technique for unleashing the zero-shot potential of multilingual encoders across diverse languages and tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of bias in the predictions of pretrained multilingual encoder models when using them in a prompt-based zero-shot learning setting. Specifically, the paper points out that these models tend to predict certain label words with higher probability just because those words occurred more frequently during pretraining, rather than based on the actual input example. This bias limits the effectiveness of zero-shot learning with these models.

To address this issue, the paper proposes using various calibration techniques to modify the predicted probabilities of the label words output by the multilingual encoder models. The goal is to counteract the inherent bias so that the predicted probabilities better reflect the actual input example, rather than just the distribution of labels in the pretraining data.

In summary, the key problem being addressed is bias in the label word predictions of multilingual encoders in zero-shot prompt-based learning, and the proposal is using calibration methods to improve these predictions.
