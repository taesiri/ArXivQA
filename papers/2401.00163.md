# [A clean-label graph backdoor attack method in node classification task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00163)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Backdoor attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs) are still in their infancy, with limited work on node classification tasks. 
- Existing attack methods have issues like requiring label modifications, graph structure changes, separate trigger optimization, and being susceptible to similarity-based defenses.  
- There is a need for a stealthier and simpler backdoor attack method for GNN node classification.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CGBA, a clean-label graph backdoor attack for node classification. 
- CGBA injects subtle feature triggers into target class nodes without changing node labels or graph structure. 
- It selects triggers from robust features of high-degree nodes to utilize feature-label associations and similarity with neighbors.
- The triggers are inserted at corresponding eigenvector positions for stealth.
- By using node's own label as the target label, CGBA establishes trigger-label mapping without label changes.

Main Contributions:
- First clean-label backdoor attack method for GNN node classification.
- Achieves high attack success rate without graph/label modifications or separate trigger optimizations.  
- More stealthy than existing methods due to clean-labels and minimal data perturbations.
- Robust to similarity-based defenses as triggers do not reduce node feature similarities.
- Extensive experiments validate attack effectiveness and stealthiness on multiple models and datasets.

In summary, CGBA is a simple yet effective clean-label backdoor attack scheme for GNN node classification that does not require graph/label modifications and is robust to similarity-based defenses. Key innovations are clean-label approach, trigger selections from node robust features, and minimal perturbations for improved stealthiness.
