## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Combinatorial optimization problems are challenging to solve in real-world scenarios due to the exponential search spaces. 
- Existing methods like exact algorithms ensure optimality but are slow, while approximate algorithms are faster but may be suboptimal.  
- There is a need for efficient methods that can provide good quality solutions for complex multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called Deep Sensitivity Analysis (DS) that incorporates explainable AI into combinatorial optimization. 
- DS utilizes a neural network architecture with variance-based global sensitivity analysis to determine feature relevance and importance for optimization objectives.
- Associative feature weights enable tailored optimization towards specific goals and constraints. 

Key Contributions:
- A novel neural network feedback-driven approach for multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems.
- Incorporation of explainable AI methods like sensitivity analysis to align optimization with domain objectives.
- Demonstrated improved performance over dynamic programming on two real-world agricultural datasets for pathogen control.
- Showcased the value of explainable knowledge in finding optimal solutions for complex problems with interacting parameters.
- The method provides feature combination explanations that can help guide practical experiments and interventions.

In summary, the paper presents a promising new technique to efficiently solve challenging multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems by integrating sensitivity-driven neural networks with transparent explainability.
