# [PLANET: Dynamic Content Planning in Autoregressive Transformers for   Long-form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we improve long-form text generation through more effective content planning and coherence modeling? 

Specifically, the paper proposes a new framework called PLANET that aims to address two key challenges in long-form text generation:

1) Conducting proper content selection and ordering to form a coherent high-level logical flow. This involves deciding "what to say and when to say it".

2) Appropriately reflecting the content plans in the final text generation. This involves deciding "how to say it". 

To address these challenges, the central hypothesis of the paper is that dynamically performing content planning and surface realization in an end-to-end fashion within large autoregressive language models like BART can lead to improved coherence and content richness in long-form text generation. 

The key ideas proposed to test this hypothesis are:

- Introducing latent representations to represent sentence-level semantic plans that guide surface generation.

- Using a bag-of-words prediction task to supervise the latent representations. 

- Employing a coherence-based contrastive learning objective to distinguish coherent and incoherent texts.

So in summary, the central research question is how to improve long-form text generation through more dynamic content planning and coherence modeling, with the hypothesis that the proposed PLANET framework can achieve this by conducting planning and realization together in an end-to-end fashion. The core ideas are the latent planning representations and contrastive learning objective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a new text generation framework called PLANET that dynamically performs content planning and surface realization in autoregressive Transformers. 

- It introduces latent representations for each target sentence to capture the overall semantics and guide the generation process. These latent representations are supervised with a sentence-level bag-of-words prediction task.

- It presents a novel coherence-based contrastive learning method to improve the coherence of generated texts, with different strategies to construct negative samples. 

- Experiments on two long-form opinion generation tasks - counter-argument generation and opinion article generation - show that PLANET outperforms strong baseline methods in both automatic evaluations and human evaluations.

In summary, the key contribution is a new end-to-end framework that unifies dynamic content planning and surface realization in autoregressive Transformers, guided by latent representations and trained with contrastive learning. This improves coherence and content richness for long-form opinion text generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel text generation framework called PLANET that performs dynamic content planning and surface realization in autoregressive Transformers by using sentence-level latent representations grounded by bag-of-words predictions and a coherence-based contrastive learning objective, and shows improved performance over strong baselines on counter-argument and opinion article generation tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in long-form text generation:

- This paper focuses on improving coherence and content richness in long-form text generation, which is an active area of research. It makes contributions in dynamic content planning and surface realization, as well as coherence-based contrastive learning.

- Compared to prior work on hierarchical decoders for text planning, this paper's approach is novel in that it dynamically performs planning and realization within the same autoregressive Transformer decoder. This allows it to leverage powerful pre-trained models like BART. Other hierarchical decoder models require modifying the model architecture.

- The two-stage planning + realization models are disjointed between planning and surface form. This paper unifies them into a single model optimized end-to-end. The latent sentence representations provide a bridge between planning and realization. 

- For coherence modeling, this paper introduces a novel contrastive loss to distinguish coherent vs incoherent outputs. Prior coherence modeling work focused more on adjacent sentence similarities. The negative sampling strategies for contrastive learning are also novel.

- Compared to global latent variable planning methods, this paper performs more fine-grained sentence-level planning with latent representations and bag-of-words prediction. The bag-of-words loss provides weak supervision.

- The model is evaluated on two challenging opinion text generation tasks. Results show significant improvements over strong baselines in automatic and human evaluations. The gains on topical coherence and content richness specifically demonstrate the benefits of the model.

In summary, the main novelties are in dynamically integrating planning into pre-trained autoregressive models, the coherence contrastive learning, and gains shown on challenging opinion generation tasks. The paper advances research on long coherent text generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying their dynamic planning method into pretraining or post-pretrainning stage. Since their model does not require additional annotated data, leveraging massive pretraining data could help improve performance on long-text generation tasks. 

- Exploring different supervision signals to train the latent representations beyond bag-of-words. For example, using discourse structures or entity usage to capture other aspects of coherence.

- Incorporating different guidance signals beyond just keyphrases, such as structured knowledge or commonsense information, to further improve output quality.

- Studying how their model could be applied to other long text generation tasks beyond just opinion generation.

- Improving the modeling of coherence, such as using supervision signals that target specific aspects like topical relatedness, causal relationships, temporal ordering, etc.

- Designing better training objectives and negative sampling strategies for the contrastive learning component.

- Exploring whether their dynamic planning approach could be integrated into model pretraining rather than just finetuning.

- Analyzing the latent representations and attention patterns to better understand the model's planning and realization process.

In summary, the main future directions focus on 1) applying the approach to other tasks/data, 2) incorporating additional guidance signals, 3) improving coherence modeling, 4) enhancing the contrastive learning, and 5) analyzing the model internals. The authors propose their method as a general framework for long text generation that could be expanded in many ways.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes PLANET, a novel text generation framework that dynamically performs content planning and surface realization in autoregressive Transformers. The key idea is to introduce latent representations for each target sentence to capture its overall semantic content. These latent representations are supervised via a sentence-level bag-of-words prediction task. The framework performs content planning by having the latent representations attend to previous context, and surface realization by having target words attend to latent representations. This allows simultaneous content planning and surface generation in a unified architecture. The model is trained end-to-end with a combination of bag-of-words prediction, generation, and contrastive losses. Experiments on counter-argument generation and opinion article generation show PLANET outperforms strong baselines in automatic and human evaluations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic content planning in autoregressive Transformers for coherent long-form text generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called PLANET for long-form text generation. The key idea is to dynamically perform content planning and surface realization in autoregressive transformers like BART. 

The framework introduces a latent representation for each target sentence to capture its overall semantic content. This latent representation attends to previous latent representations and context to plan the content of the current sentence. The output words for the sentence attend to this latent representation for guidance during surface realization. A sentence-level bag-of-words prediction task provides supervision for the latent representations. The framework also uses a coherence-based contrastive learning objective to improve output coherence, using strategies like shuffling sentences and replacing content to construct negative samples. 

Experiments are conducted on counter-argument generation using Reddit ChangeMyView data and opinion article generation using New York Times articles. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations show the proposed PLANET framework generates more coherent outputs with richer content compared to baselines, by conducting more effective dynamic content planning within the pretrained autoregressive decoder.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes PLANET, a novel text generation framework that dynamically performs content planning and surface realization in autoregressive Transformers. The key idea is to introduce a latent representation for each target sentence that captures its overall semantic content. During decoding, the latent representation of the current sentence attends to previous latent representations and context to perform content planning. Then each word in the sentence attends to the latent representation of that sentence as well as previous context to generate the surface form. This allows content planning and surface realization to be performed jointly in a unified framework based on Transformer decoder self-attention. To provide supervision for the latent representations, an auxiliary bag-of-words prediction task is introduced to predict salient words in each target sentence based on its latent representation. The framework can be trained end-to-end and applied to pre-trained autoregressive transformers like BART. A coherence-based contrastive learning loss is also proposed to improve output coherence. Experiments on counter-argument generation and opinion article generation demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach over strong baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating coherent long-form text with proper content control and planning. Specifically:

- Long-form text generation tasks like counter-argument generation and opinion article generation require the model to select and organize content appropriately to form a coherent high-level logical flow. 

- However, existing neural sequence-to-sequence models tend to generate incoherent or repetitive outputs that lack proper content control, even for large pre-trained models like BART.

- The key challenges are: (1) conducting proper content selection and ordering to form a coherent logical flow; (2) appropriately reflecting the content plans in the final text generation.

To address these issues, the paper proposes PLANET, a novel text generation framework that can dynamically perform content planning and surface realization in autoregressive transformers like BART. The key ideas include:

- Introducing latent representations to represent sentence-level semantic plans and guide surface generation.

- Grounding the latent representations with bag-of-words prediction to provide supervision. 

- Modeling the interactions between latent representations for content planning and generated words for surface realization using autoregressive self-attention.

- A coherence-based contrastive learning objective to improve output coherence.

The proposed model is evaluated on two long-form opinion generation tasks - counter-argument generation and opinion article generation. Both automatic and human evaluations show PLANET can generate more coherent outputs with richer content compared to strong baseline methods.
