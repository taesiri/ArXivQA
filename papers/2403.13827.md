# [Self-Supervised Path Planning in UAV-aided Wireless Networks based on   Active Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper addresses the problem of optimizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectories to maximize performance in wireless networks. Specifically, the goal is to find the best route for a UAV to visit multiple ground user (GU) hotspots, provide data service, and return to its starting location within a time constraint. This is framed as a 'traveling salesman problem with profits' (TSPWP).

Proposed Solution 
- A two-stage self-supervised learning approach is proposed based on active inference:
  1) Learn a "world model" from training demonstrations provided by an offline TSPWP optimizer. This allows the UAV to understand the environment and implicitly discover the optimization policy.
  2) Use the learned world model for online planning and decision-making. The UAV leverages the model to simulate environments, score potential actions by "expected surprise", and pick actions that minimize surprise relative to expected outcomes.

Key Contributions
- Introduces online planning based on a learned world model and the concept of "expected surprise" for policy scoring/selection. 
- Enables UAVs to make real-time autonomous decisions and adapt quickly to new situations without extensive retraining.
- Demonstrates better generalization and more reliable performance compared to a modified Q-learning approach over various testing scenarios.
- Proposed self-supervised methodology offers an alternative to traditional reinforcement learning for sequential decision problems.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and practical contributions in enabling self-supervised UAV path planning that is responsive to changing environments, avoiding limitations of conventional techniques. Performance gains are empirically demonstrated.
