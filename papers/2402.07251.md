# [Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Hard Linear Equality Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Surrogate models like neural networks are needed to efficiently replace expensive simulations, but they lack physical interpretability and cannot strictly satisfy known physical constraints. 
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) incorporate some physical knowledge as soft constraints in the loss function, but still cannot guarantee perfect satisfaction of constraints. This causes issues when interconnecting multiple surrogate models.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper develops a new architecture called KKT-hPINN that enforces hard linear equality constraints by introducing two non-trainable projection layers based on the KKT optimality conditions.
- This analytically projects the neural network predictions onto the feasible region defined by the linear constraints in each iteration. 
- The projection is posed as a quadratic program and solved explicitly, guaranteeing satisfaction of constraints during both training and inference.

Contributions:
- KKT-hPINN provides mathematical guarantees for satisfying hard linear equality constraints, unlike other approaches.
- It improves accuracy over regular NNs and does not require tedious hyperparameter tuning like PINNs.
- Case studies demonstrate superior performance over NNs and PINNs when modeling a CSTR unit, a full chemical plant, and an extractive distillation subsystem.
- KKT-hPINN showed faster convergence, lower errors, and strict constraint satisfaction regardless of dataset size.
- The approach is compatible with existing network architectures and different loss functions.
- It guides optimization towards more physically consistent solutions, enabling interconnection of surrogate models.

In summary, the paper presented a principled methodology to enforce hard linear constraints in neural networks, with mathematical guarantees, ease of use and improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The proposed KKT-hPINN architecture facilitates more reliable surrogate modeling for process systems.
