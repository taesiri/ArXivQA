# [Just Add $π$! Pose Induced Video Transformers for Understanding   Activities of Daily Living](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18840)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Pose Induced Video Transformer (PI-ViT or π-ViT), a novel approach to learn discriminative visual representations for understanding Activities of Daily Living (ADL) by inducing human pose information into video transformers. The challenges in ADL include visually similar actions viewed from different camera angles. PI-ViT consists of two plug-in modules - 2D Skeleton Induction Module (2D-SIM) and 3D Skeleton Induction Module (3D-SIM) that are inserted into a video transformer architecture. 2D-SIM refines representations by mapping skeleton joints to visual tokens, providing extra supervision to RGB regions containing relevant joints. 3D-SIM aligns visual token features with optimized 3D skeleton features to address challenges of fine-grained motion and changing viewpoints. These modules perform pose-aware auxiliary tasks during training to induce complementary pose information into the visual representations. Notably, during inference, the modules are removed, eliminating the need for poses while retaining their benefits. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on real-world (Toyota Smarthome) and large-scale RGB-D (NTU) ADL datasets without requiring additional computational overhead during inference. The unified induction of 2D and 3D pose information enables PI-ViT to effectively address key ADL challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Pose Induced Video Transformer (PI-ViT or π-ViT) that leverages both 2D and 3D human poses through auxiliary tasks during training to enhance video transformers for understanding activities of daily living, achieving state-of-the-art performance without needing poses during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of PI-ViT (Pose Induced Video Transformer), the first video transformer model that leverages both 2D and 3D human poses to enhance video representation learning for understanding Activities of Daily Living (ADL) videos. 

Specifically, PI-ViT introduces two novel plug-in modules - 2D Skeleton Induction Module (2D-SIM) and 3D Skeleton Induction Module (3D-SIM) - that perform auxiliary tasks to induce complementary pose information into the visual token representations learned by video transformers. This allows PI-ViT to address key challenges in ADL such as fine-grained and visually similar actions as well as viewpoint changes. 

Importantly, these modules provide supervision during training only and can be removed during inference, eliminating the need for poses at test time. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance of PI-ViT on multiple real-world ADL datasets without requiring additional computational overhead during inference.

- Activities of Daily Living (ADL) - Complex human activities like cooking, cleaning, etc. that pose challenges for action recognition due to fine-grained details and viewpoint variations.

- Fine-grained actions - Subtle differences in motions or appearances between actions that need to be modeled, e.g. drinking from a bottle vs cup. 

- Viewpoint invariance - The ability to recognize actions reliably regardless of the camera viewpoint.

- RGB representation learning - Learning discriminative visual features from RGB videos using transformers.

- Skeleton-based action recognition - Leveraging 2D or 3D human joint positions over time to recognize actions, provides view invariance.

The key things this paper tries to address are RGB representation learning for ADL videos using ideas from skeleton-based recognition through the proposed PI-ViT model and its components.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces two modules - 2D Skeleton Induction Module (2D-SIM) and 3D Skeleton Induction Module (3D-SIM). What are the key differences in the objectives and workings of these two modules?

2. The 2D-SIM module constructs a token-skeleton map to establish correspondence between visual tokens and skeleton joints. What are some alternatives for establishing this correspondence that were explored in the paper and how did they impact performance?  

3. The 3D-SIM module performs feature alignment between the visual features and 3D skeleton features. Why is traditional knowledge distillation ineffective for this task as shown in the experiments?

4. Both 2D-SIM and 3D-SIM perform classification tasks on top of the visual features. What is the motivation behind adding these auxiliary classification tasks? How do they aid the overall objective?

5. The 2D and 3D skeleton features are only used during training and not during inference. What changes would be needed in the method if skeleton features were to be used during inference as well?

6. The paper shows that global alignment works better than local alignment in 3D-SIM. Provide some hypotheses explaining why this could be the case.

7. The inductive bias provided by 2D and 3D pose helps address fine-grained motion and cross-view challenges. Are there other modalities that can provide complementary inductive biases?

8. How robust is the method to noise in the pose data? At what levels of noise do the gains over the baseline diminish?

9. The runtime vs performance analysis shows that the method achieves better accuracy-latency tradeoffs compared to previous state-of-the-art. What component contributes most to the improved latency?

10. The method outperforms the baseline transformer and pose-based models on real-world datasets but underperforms on more controlled datasets like NTU120. What factors contribute to this behavior?
