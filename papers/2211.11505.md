# [Local-to-Global Registration for Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11505)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we simultaneously reconstruct neural radiance fields from images and register the camera poses, in a robust and accurate way?

The key ideas and contributions towards addressing this question are:

- The authors propose a local-to-global registration method to jointly optimize the neural radiance field and camera poses. This combines the benefits of flexible pixel-wise alignment with constrained parametric alignment.

- They introduce differentiable parameter estimation solvers for rigid and homography transformations. These are used to calculate the gradient flow from the global to local alignment, which is crucial for optimization.

- The method is demonstrated to work well for reconstructing both 2D neural images and 3D neural radiance fields, on both synthetic and real datasets. It outperforms prior methods in terms of robustness to initialization and accuracy.

- The local-to-global strategy makes the optimization much less sensitive to initialization compared to direct joint optimization. It can resolve large misalignments in camera poses.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that a local-to-global registration approach can enable robust and accurate joint optimization of neural radiance fields and camera poses, overcoming limitations of prior work. The experiments support this hypothesis.
