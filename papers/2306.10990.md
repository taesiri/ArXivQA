# [Super-resolving sparse observations in partial differential equations: A   physics-constrained convolutional neural network approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10990)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Observations of physical systems like turbulent flows are often limited, with only sparse or partial measurements being accessible. This obscures the underlying dynamics and poses challenges for system identification and reconstruction. 
- Super-resolution methods aim to reconstruct high-resolution states from limited observations, but most current methods rely on having paired low- and high-resolution training data.
- For observations of physical systems, not having access to ground-truth high-resolution data is problematic. Physics-informed neural networks can impose constraints based on physical laws, but have challenges exploiting spatial correlations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to infer high-resolution solutions from sparse spatiotemporal observations of nonlinear PDEs, without needing full high-resolution data.
- The PC-CNN architecture uses convolutional layers to exploit spatial correlations and upsampling for resolution enhancement.
- A time-windowing scheme allows computation of residuals over local time windows to impose physical constraints. Losses penalize violations of observations and governing equations.
- Demonstrated on inferring high-res velocity fields from low-res observations of a chaotic, turbulent 2D Kolmogorov fluid flow.

Main Contributions:
- Design of a PC-CNN architecture for super-resolution of spatiotemporal PDE observations.
- Formulation of an optimization problem with observation and physics-based residual losses to constrain the network without full high-res data.
- Use of a differentiable pseudospectral solver for efficient imposition of periodic BCs and spectral accuracy.
- Results showing accurate qualitative and quantitative inference of unresolved turbulence scales from low-res inputs.
- Proposed framework enables super-resolution of experimental data without paired high-res counterparts.

In summary, the key innovation is a PC-CNN that leverages physical constraints to super-resolve fluid flow observations without requiring inaccessible high-resolution ground truth data. This could enable enhanced analysis from experimental datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a physics-constrained convolutional neural network approach to infer high-resolution solutions to spatiotemporal partial differential equations from sparse observations without needing inaccessible high-resolution training data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) approach for super-resolving sparse observations of solutions to spatiotemporal partial differential equations. Specifically:

- They formulate a framework to impose physical constraints (governing PDE equations) on a convolutional neural network to perform super-resolution of sparse/low-resolution observations without needing the full high-resolution data. This allows inferring unresolved physics and scales.

- They apply the PC-CNN to a turbulent fluid flow, which is a challenging spatiotemporally chaotic system described by the Navier-Stokes equations. The PC-CNN is able to accurately reconstruct high-resolution solutions both qualitatively and quantitatively compared to interpolation baselines.

- The proposed approach enables accurate super-resolution of experimental data or low-fidelity simulations where only sparse observations may be available, without needing inaccessible high-resolution reference data. This is achieved by constraining physical laws and exploiting spatial correlations with convolutional neural networks.

In summary, the key innovation is in designing a physics-constrained convolutional neural network architecture that can exploit physical constraints and spatial correlations to perform accurate super-resolution of sparse observations for spatiotemporal partial differential equations.
