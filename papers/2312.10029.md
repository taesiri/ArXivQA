# [Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10029)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Existing unsupervised methods claim to elicit latent knowledge from large language models (LLMs) by exploiting consistency properties that knowledge is expected to have. 
- This paper theoretically and empirically refutes the effectiveness of such claims, showing that these methods fail to reliably elicit factual knowledge.

Main Results
- Proves theoretically that the consistency loss used by contrast-consistent search (CCS) can be optimally satisfied by arbitrary binary classifiers, not just knowledge. 
- Shows constructively that for any CCS probe, there exists another probe with the same loss but inducing an arbitrary classifier.
- Conducts experiments inserting distracting features into prompts that unsupervised methods latch onto instead of factual knowledge.
- Demonstrates sensitivity to unimportant prompt details, with different prompts leading probes to have different accuracies.
- Finds CCS makes similar predictions to PCA, suggesting it does not leverage knowledge consistency.

Conclusions
- Unsupervised knowledge elicitation methods are insufficient, tending to discover arbitrary prominent features rather than knowledge.
- Contributes sanity checks for evaluating elicitation methods using modified prompts and metrics.
- Conceptual issues around distinguishing model knowledge from simulated entities' beliefs may persist even for more sophisticated future methods.

Main contributions are the theoretical results refuting claims about CCS specifically exploiting knowledge consistency, the controlled experiments concretely demonstrating failure modes of unsupervised methods in practice, and providing guidance on sanity checks for developing better knowledge elicitation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper theoretically and empirically shows that existing unsupervised methods for eliciting latent knowledge from language models do not actually discover knowledge, but rather tend to learn whatever prominent feature exists in the model's representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proving theoretically that arbitrary features satisfy the CCS loss equally well as knowledge, refuting claims that CCS optimizes for knowledge.

2. Showing empirically through experiments that unsupervised methods like CCS, PCA, and k-means detect prominent features in activations that are not necessarily knowledge, such as random words, a character's opinion, or unimportant details of the prompt. 

3. Demonstrating that CCS makes similar predictions as PCA, suggesting CCS is not exploiting consistency structure of knowledge.

4. Contributing sanity checks to apply when evaluating future knowledge elicitation methods, using modified prompts and metrics.

5. Hypothesizing that the identification issues explored in this paper will persist for future unsupervised methods that use consistency properties to elicit knowledge, due to models' ability to simulate other agents' knowledge.

In summary, the main contribution is providing both theoretical and empirical evidence that existing unsupervised methods are insufficient for discovering latent knowledge in language models. The paper also suggests sanity checks and implications for future elicitation methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Unsupervised learning
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Latent knowledge
- Contrastive activations
- Contrast-consistent search (CCS) 
- Consistency structure
- Knowledge elicitation
- Probabilistic knowledge representation
- Unsupervised probes
- Activation clustering
- Principal component analysis (PCA)

The main focus of the paper seems to be on evaluating unsupervised methods like CCS and PCA for eliciting latent knowledge from LLMs, using contrastive activations as input data. The key claims evaluated are that knowledge has a certain consistency structure that can be leveraged, vs. other features represented in the activations. The main conclusions are that existing unsupervised elicitation methods are insufficient and sensitive to prominent non-knowledge features.

Some other concepts mentioned include dishonesty/misalignment in LLMs, improving oversight and interpretability, contrast pairs for generating activations, theoretical results on optimality of arbitrary binary classifiers, and comparisons to supervised probing methods. But the core ideas have to do with unsupervised elicitation and the consistency properties it relies on.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have come up with about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the key assumptions of contrast-consistent search (CCS) and how reasonable are these assumptions for discovering latent knowledge in large language models? For example, does knowledge necessarily satisfy a probabilistic structure?

2. How sensitive is CCS to the choice of prompts used to generate the contrastive examples? Could different prompts lead to eliciting different "knowledge" even if the underlying model is the same? 

3. The paper proves theoretically that arbitrary binary features can satisfy the CCS objective. Does this indicate fundamental limitations of unsupervised approaches for knowledge elicitation based solely on internal consistency properties?

4. The modified prompting experiments point to language models potentially encoding simulated beliefs of characters alongside factual knowledge. How can we distinguish between these two types of representations? Is it possible to avoid eliciting simulated perspectives?

5. Instruction tuning seems to make some language models more robust to distraction features as evidenced by the T5-FLAN experiments. Does instruction tuning fundamentally change the knowledge contained in the models or only make the true knowledge more prominent/accessible?

6. How dependent is CCS on implementation details like choice of layer, probe model capacity, optimization procedure etc.? Are there reliable ways to set these hyperparameters based on theory or must they be tuned empirically?  

7. Can the theoretical properties shown for CCS be generalized to other unsupervised knowledge elicitation methods? Or do the negative results only apply to CCS specifically?

8. The agreement experiments show CCS makes similar predictions to PCA. Is the consistency structure in CCS really providing a meaningful inductive bias compared to standard unsupervised learning?

9. Evaluations in the paper rely on having access to ground truth labels. How can we evaluate elicited knowledge more directly, without assuming access to an external source of truth? 

10. What modifications could make unsupervised elicitation methods like CCS provably elicit factual knowledge rather than incidental features? For example, using different prompting styles, adding auxiliary consistency losses, or modifying model architecture.
