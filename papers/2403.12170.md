# [Sim2Real Manipulation on Unknown Objects with Tactile-based   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12170)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Using tactile sensors for robotic manipulation remains challenging, especially in terms of generalization - how can we train a tactile-based policy that can manipulate diverse, unseen objects? Prior methods either rely on imperfect state estimation from tactile data or have limited diversity in training objects.  

Proposed Solution: The authors propose a system to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy with only tactile observations in simulation using a diverse set of objects, and then perform zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the policy to a real robot. To address the sim-to-real gap, they study different tactile image representations and how each affects real-robot performance after transfer.

Methods:
- Generate simulated tactile images during RL training in SAPIEN simulator with a variety of household objects 
- Investigate 3 tactile representations: raw RGB images, difference images, binary images
- Use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train policies for a pivoting task
- Perform zero-shot transfer of policies from simulation to real-world without any real-robot data
- Evaluate on real robot with 16 unseen objects across multiple categories  

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of sim-to-real transfer for tactile RL policies without any real-world data
- Show that training with diverse objects in simulation enables better generalization to novel objects compared to single-category training  
- Find that more abstract tactile representations (binary) transfer better and are more robust than raw tactile images
- Policies successfully manipulate diverse unseen objects in the real-world despite sim-to-real gap, highlighting applicability of approach

In summary, the key innovation is successfully applying sim-to-real transfer with only simulated tactile training data to achieve generalized tactile-based policies that can manipulate novel objects in the real world. The analysis on tactile representations also provides useful insights.
