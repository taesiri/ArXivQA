# [Bringing Back the Context: Camera Trap Species Identification as Link   Prediction on Multimodal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00608)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Species identification in camera trap images is important for biodiversity monitoring and conservation. However, current models tend to overfit to backgrounds, limiting generalization to new locations.
- Images have rich associated context (e.g. location, time, taxonomy) that is underutilized. Effectively incorporating this heterogeneous multimodal context is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes COSMO, a novel framework that reformulates species classification as link prediction in a multimodal knowledge graph (KG).
- The multimodal KG integrates images, labels, temporospatial context, and biological taxonomy. Species classification is posed as predicting image-label links.
- Image, location, time entities are encoded using ResNet, MLPs. Relations and categorical entities have embedding lookups. Link prediction is done using DistMult.

Contributions:
- Unified framework to incorporate heterogeneous context for species classification via multimodal KG link prediction.
- Construction of novel multimodal KG integrating images, labels, temporospatial and taxonomy information.
- Achieves competitive performance on iWildCam2020-WILDS and Snapshot Mountain Zebra datasets compared to standard species classification methods. 
- Improves robustness and out-of-distribution generalization using context.
- Enhances sample efficiency for under-represented species by utilizing taxonomy and other context.

In summary, the paper presents a new perspective for context-aware species classification by reformulating it as multimodal KG link prediction. The rich heterogeneous context in the KG helps improve model generalization and sample efficiency.
