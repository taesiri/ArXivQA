# [Latent Feature-Guided Diffusion Models for Shadow Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02156)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel shadow removal approach using latent feature-guided diffusion models. The key idea is to guide the diffusion process with a learned latent feature space that encapsulates essential perceptual information of shadow-free images. This helps address the issue of diffusion models being overly guided by non-shadow regions when conditioned solely on the input shadow image and mask. In addition, the paper introduces a Dense Latent Variable Fusion (DLVF) module to alleviate posterior collapse issues in diffusion models by strengthening connections between the noise variable and diffusion network features. The method is evaluated on standard shadow removal benchmarks like AISTD and achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. A key advantage demonstrated is the ability to perform not just general shadow removal but also instance-level shadow removal. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed latent feature guidance and DLVF module. The method shows promising capability of diffusion models for highly ill-posed image restoration problems where perceptual quality is critical.
