# [Fast OMP for Exact Recovery and Sparse Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00146)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) is an effective method for sparse signal recovery and approximation. However, its computational complexity increases significantly as the number of non-zeros in the signal increases.

Proposed Solutions:
1. OMP through Successive Regression (OMP-SR):
- Avoids expensive computation of the pseudo-inverse when solving the least squares problem in each OMP iteration. Uses univariate regression for the new atom, and backtracking to update coefficients of previously selected atoms.  
- Computationally more efficient than standard OMP, selects the same atoms as OMP does.

2. Blocked Successive Regression (BSR):  
- Extends OMP-SR by selecting a block of atoms at each iteration instead of a single atom. Block size is a hyperparameter.
- Projects onto just the newly selected atoms to reduce cost. 
- Preserves convergence guarantee of OMP using new selection criteria derived in the paper.
- Significantly faster than OMP and OMP-SR.

Main Contributions:
- Provided sufficient conditions for exact sparse signal recovery using the new greedy selection criteria. Conditions are in terms of coherence and cumulative coherence, avoiding Restricted Isometry Property.
- Proved approximation error bound for BSR when applied to general non-sparse signals. Error bound matches OMP but obtained in fewer iterations.
- Demonstrated significant gains in speed over OMP on both synthetic and real image data while preserving accuracy.

The key impact is developing faster and provable greedy algorithms for sparse approximation by avoiding the computational bottlenecks in classical OMP.
