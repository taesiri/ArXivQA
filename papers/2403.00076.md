# [Navigation and Control of Unconventional VTOL UAVs in Forward-Flight   with Explicit Wind Velocity Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00076)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the control and state estimation problems for a class of unconventional vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drones operating in forward-flight. These types of drones can takeoff vertically but fly horizontally for efficient long-distance travel. They may have additional lifting and control surfaces in unconventional configurations.

- Controlling these drones is challenging because the additional control surfaces exert complex moments dependent on the aircraft states and wind velocity. Therefore, accurately estimating the aircraft's navigation states and the wind velocity is important for reliable performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A tightly-coupled state estimator based on an "Imperfect" Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is used to estimate the navigation states, sensor biases and wind velocity.

- An attitude controller based on $SO(3)$ geometry is proposed to control aircraft orientation and ensure balanced flight. It uses the estimated airspeed and coordinated turn equations to achieve this.

- A control allocator determines the control surface deflections needed to achieve the desired control moments for orientation control. It uses the state and wind estimates.

Main Contributions:

- Adaptation of geometric $SO(3)$ attitude controllers, commonly used for multicopters, for fixed-wing VTOL aircraft, ensuring balanced flight without needing an explicit sideslip controller.

- Use of an IEKF for tightly-coupled estimation of navigation states and wind velocity. IEKF offers advantages over standard EKFs for this aerospace application.

- Demonstrating how directly incorporating wind velocity estimates into both attitude control and control allocation improves overall control and estimation performance.

In summary, the key novelty is the combined use of geometric attitude control and invariant state estimation to achieve reliable navigation and control of unconventional VTOL drones. Simulations demonstrate robustness across varying conditions.
