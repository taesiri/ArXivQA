# [Navigation and Control of Unconventional VTOL UAVs in Forward-Flight   with Explicit Wind Velocity Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00076)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the control and state estimation problems for a class of unconventional vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drones operating in forward-flight. These types of drones can takeoff vertically but fly horizontally for efficient long-distance travel. They may have additional lifting and control surfaces in unconventional configurations.

- Controlling these drones is challenging because the additional control surfaces exert complex moments dependent on the aircraft states and wind velocity. Therefore, accurately estimating the aircraft's navigation states and the wind velocity is important for reliable performance.

Proposed Solution:
- A tightly-coupled state estimator based on an "Imperfect" Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is used to estimate the navigation states, sensor biases and wind velocity.

- An attitude controller based on $SO(3)$ geometry is proposed to control aircraft orientation and ensure balanced flight. It uses the estimated airspeed and coordinated turn equations to achieve this.

- A control allocator determines the control surface deflections needed to achieve the desired control moments for orientation control. It uses the state and wind estimates.

Main Contributions:

- Adaptation of geometric $SO(3)$ attitude controllers, commonly used for multicopters, for fixed-wing VTOL aircraft, ensuring balanced flight without needing an explicit sideslip controller.

- Use of an IEKF for tightly-coupled estimation of navigation states and wind velocity. IEKF offers advantages over standard EKFs for this aerospace application.

- Demonstrating how directly incorporating wind velocity estimates into both attitude control and control allocation improves overall control and estimation performance.

In summary, the key novelty is the combined use of geometric attitude control and invariant state estimation to achieve reliable navigation and control of unconventional VTOL drones. Simulations demonstrate robustness across varying conditions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a solution for state estimation and control of unconventional VTOL UAVs operating in forward flight conditions using a tightly-coupled estimator to estimate aircraft states and wind velocity, and an SO(3)-based attitude controller with a control allocator.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The adaptation of $SO(3)$-based attitude controllers commonly used for multicopters for use with forward-flight aircraft in such a way that no explicit sideslip controller is needed to ensure balanced flight. The proposed controller uses the coordinated turn equation and estimated airspeed.

2) The use of an invariant filtering framework ("Imperfect" IEKF) for tightly-coupled estimation of both the navigation states and wind velocity. 

3) Demonstrating that using the wind velocity estimates directly in the attitude controller and control allocator leads to reliable performance in navigation and control of unconventional VTOL UAVs operating in forward-flight conditions.

In summary, the combination of the adapted attitude controller and invariant state estimator enables robust control and estimation for a class of unconventional VTOL UAVs. The wind velocity estimates are key to achieving balanced flight. The proposed methods can help ensure reliable flight characteristics when designing new VTOL UAV configurations.

The paper focuses on the navigation and control problems for a class of unconventional VTOL UAVs, specifically tailsitter aircraft, operating in forward flight conditions. Key aspects include using an IEKF for tightly-coupled state and wind estimation, an SO(3)-based attitude controller, control allocation for overactuated systems, and analysis of robustness using Monte Carlo simulations. The methods are tailored for unconventional UAV configurations with additional control surfaces in forward flight. So the main keywords reflect this focus on estimation, control, and analysis of VTOL tailsitter UAVs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using an "Imperfect" Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) for state estimation. How does the "Imperfect" IEKF differ from a standard IEKF? What are the specific advantages of using this variant for the state estimation problem considered in this paper?

2. The paper places the aircraft states, sensor biases, and wind velocity into an element of a new matrix Lie group G. What is the motivation for doing this? How does it allow the formulation of the invariant filtering framework?

3. The paper uses a left-invariant error definition in the IEKF derivation. Why was this choice made over a right-invariant error? How does the mix of left-invariant, right-invariant, and neither left- nor right- invariant sensors impact this choice?

4. How do the process model Jacobians in the IEKF differ from those in a typical Multiplicative EKF (MEKF)? Why does this make the IEKF potentially more robust to poor state estimates and initialization errors?

5. The paper proposes a method to ensure balanced flight without an explicit sideslip controller. Explain the coordinated turn equation used and how the airspeed estimate enables this approach. How could this method fail if there were errors in the airspeed estimate?

6. Discuss the motivation for using the control allocation scheme in this paper. Why is it important for the specific aircraft configuration considered? How do errors in the state and wind estimates impact the performance of the allocation scheme?

7. The paper demonstrates using Monte Carlo simulations that some aircraft geometries lead to a control allocation scheme that is much less robust to state estimate errors than others. Propose some ways to systematically evaluate configurations for robustness.

8. The guidance law uses a desired lateral acceleration command based on cross-track error and look-ahead distance. Suggest some alternative guidance laws that could directly leverage the wind velocity estimates.

9. The paper assumes known mass and inertia properties. Discuss potential online methods for joint estimation of these parameters along with the states, biases, and wind velocity.

10. This paper considers a tailsitter VTOL aircraft. Discuss how the proposed control and estimation methods would need to be modified for other VTOL configurations such as tilt-rotors or tilt-wings.
