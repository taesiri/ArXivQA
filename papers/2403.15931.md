## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "X-Portrait: Expressive Portrait Animation with Hierarchical Motion Attention":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of animating a single static portrait image using the facial expressions and head motions from a driving video that likely features a different subject. Prior works have focused mainly on talking head scenarios. This paper aims to go beyond that and synthesize high-fidelity animations of in-the-wild portraits exhibiting highly dynamic head poses and expressive facial expressions, while preserving the identity from the reference portrait.

Method:
The paper proposes a novel framework called X-Portrait that utilizes the generative capabilities of a pre-trained latent diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) as a rendering backbone. It incorporates three additional trainable modules for disentangled control of appearance, motion, and temporal smoothness. A key innovation is the motion control scheme which is trained on cross-identity image pairs synthesized by an image reenactment network. This allows interpreting motion directly from the driving RGB frames rather than relying on explicit pose representations like landmarks. An auxiliary local control module further enhances attention to detailed facial movements. Random heterogeneous scaling during training mitigates appearance leakage from the driving frames.

Main Contributions:
- A new portrait animation framework built on top of Stable Diffusion with fine-grained motion control.
- A novel implicit motion control scheme trained with cross-identity scaling-augmented images to retain driving motions without appearance leakage.  
- Enhanced attention to subtle facial expressions using local control signals.
- State-of-the-art results animating diverse real and artistic portraits with videos exhibiting a wide range of emotions and expressions.
- Demonstrated capability to generalize to unseen portraits and motions without fine-tuning.

In summary, the paper presents an expressive portrait animation framework that achieves superior visual quality, motion accuracy, identity preservation, and domain generalization compared to prior state-of-the-art.
