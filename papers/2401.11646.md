# [Nonparametric Estimation via Variance-Reduced Sketching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11646)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper "Nonparametric Estimation via Variance-Reduced Sketching":

Problem:
- Classical nonparametric methods like kernel estimators suffer from the curse of dimensionality and become inadequate for estimating multivariate functions in higher dimensions. 

- Existing methods for nonparametric estimation problems either require extensive observations of the function prior to using randomized sketching techniques or do not properly account for the variance introduced by random sampling.

Proposed Solution - Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS):
- Conceptualizes multivariate functions as infinite matrices/tensors and develops a sketching technique in function spaces to estimate the range space of functions. 

- Tailors the sketching operators to align with regularity of functions and account for variance of random samples, aiming to reduce curse of dimensionality.

- Applies sketching to estimate low-rank tensor representation of functions in a general tensor-based framework.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a way to perform nonparametric estimation in higher dimensions with reduced curse of dimensionality.

- Offers theoretical analysis to justify ability of VRS for accurate range estimation and function approximation.

- Demonstrates through simulations and real-data experiments that VRS substantially outperforms neural network estimators and classical kernel methods.

- Showcases wide applicability of VRS framework to problems like density estimation, nonparametric regression, and principal component analysis.

Overall, the paper makes important contributions regarding using tools from numerical linear algebra to advance nonparametric statistics and machine learning for multivariate data.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS) for nonparametric estimation of multivariate functions. The key contributions are:

1) It conceptualizes multivariate functions as matrices/tensors and develops a sketching technique in function spaces to estimate the range of the underlying function. The sketching operators are designed to reduce variance and curse of dimensionality.

2) It provides a general tensor-based algorithm for multivariate function estimation using the proposed range estimators. Theoretical analysis shows VRS can estimate functions with reduced curse of dimensionality compared to classical kernel methods.
