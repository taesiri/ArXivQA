# [Power Bundle Adjustment for Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12834)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop a more efficient method for solving large-scale bundle adjustment problems in 3D reconstruction?

The key contributions and innovations presented are:

- Introducing Power Bundle Adjustment (PoBA), a new technique based on power series expansion of the inverse Schur complement, as a way to efficiently solve large BA problems. This constitutes a new "inverse expansion method".

- Providing theoretical justification and proofs for using power series expansion and proving the convergence of the PoBA method. 

- Evaluating PoBA extensively on real-world BAL datasets and showing it is faster and more memory efficient compared to state-of-the-art methods like square root BA and Ceres solvers.

- Incorporating PoBA into a distributed BA framework (PoST) and demonstrating significant speed and accuracy improvements compared to the existing distributed solver STBA.

So in summary, the central research question is developing a faster and more scalable technique for large-scale bundle adjustment for 3D reconstruction. The key innovation is using power series expansion of the inverse Schur complement in a novel way to efficiently solve these large sparse linear systems. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation on real datasets are provided to validate the proposed PoBA and PoST methods.
