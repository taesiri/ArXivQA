# [The Sky's the Limit: Re-lightable Outdoor Scenes via a Sky-pixel   Constrained Illumination Prior and Outside-In Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16937)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a method called NeuSky for inverse rendering of outdoor scenes from multi-view image collections. The key idea is to leverage both direct observations of distant sky illumination from sky pixels in the images as well as a learned prior over natural illuminations (RENI++) to estimate high-quality RGBD scene representations. A novel differentiable model of sky visibility based on a neural directional distance field is introduced to allow shadows and interreflections to inform the geometry, albedo and illumination estimates. This also avoids baking shadows into texture maps. The method is evaluated on the NeRF-OSR dataset and shown to outperform prior state-of-the-art methods for outdoor inverse rendering and relighting. Key technical innovations include the use of sky pixels as direct illumination constraints, joint optimization of visibility and scene properties thanks to a continuous and differentiable model, and incorporation of statistical regularities of outdoor illumination via the RENI++ model. Limitations of the approach are long training times and high memory requirements. Possible future work includes extending the illumination and reflection model to capture secondary bounces.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an outdoor scene inverse rendering method that uses a neural illumination prior, exploits direct sky pixel observations as constraints, and trains a differentiable sky visibility model end-to-end with the scene representation to enable accurate shadow rendering and improved geometry, albedo, and illumination estimation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Exploiting sky pixel observations to directly constrain the estimated distant illumination environment. The authors observe that any pixel labeled as "sky" provides a direct measurement of the distant lighting in that direction. This helps resolve illumination/albedo ambiguities.

2) A novel differentiable model of sky visibility based on a spherical directional distance function (DDF). The DDF allows efficient computation of which directions are visible/occluded from scene points. Making this differentiable allows appearance losses from shadows to inform geometry and illumination estimation.

3) Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the NeRF-OSR outdoor scene relighting benchmark by combining the above ideas with a neural illumination prior (RENI++). The method is able to estimate high quality geometry, albedo, illumination environments and visibility to accurately reproduce shadows and lighting effects.

In summary, the main contribution is a new outdoor inverse rendering framework that can be trained end-to-end, exploits constraints from sky pixels, and models visibility and natural illumination in a differentiable manner for high quality relightable scene reconstructions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Inverse rendering - The process of estimating underlying 3D scene properties like geometry, materials, and lighting from 2D images. This paper tackles the problem of inverse rendering outdoor scenes.

- Neural scene representation - The paper uses a neural signed distance function (NeuS) to represent 3D scene geometry. This allows differentiable rendering for optimization.

- Illumination environment - The paper models outdoor illumination as a distant high dynamic range environment map parameterized by a neural field (RENI++).

- Sky visibility - A key contribution is a method to estimate visibility of the sky/environment map from different points in the scene using a neural directional distance field. This enables shadows.

- End-to-end training - The neural scene representation and sky visibility field can be trained jointly, allowing gradients to flow across visibility and inform estimation of geometry, materials, and lighting.

- Multi-view outdoor images - The method takes as input varying viewpoint images of outdoor scenes and fits the neural scene representation to match image appearances.

- Relighting - By disentangling albedo, geometry, and illumination, the estimated model supports realistically relighting scenes from novel views by changing the illumination.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel "outside-in" method for computing differentiable sky visibility based on a neural directional distance function. Can you explain in more detail how this method works and why it is more efficient than alternatives like sphere tracing? 

2. The paper makes use of a neural illumination prior called RENI++. What are the key properties and advantages of using RENI++ over other illumination representation methods in the context of this inverse rendering pipeline?

3. The method exploits direct observations of sky pixels to help constrain estimates of the illumination environment. Why is this an important cue? And what other constraints help resolve ambiguities between illumination, albedo and geometry?

4. What is the rationale behind modelling illumination with a neural field at infinity under a scene contraction, while modelling visibility on a near bounding sphere? Why is this separation important?  

5. The differentiable visibility model is supervised both indirectly through appearance losses and directly through several consistency losses. What role does each of these losses play and why are both needed?

6. How does the method ensure gradients can flow through from shading/shadows to influence geometry, albedo and illumination estimations? And why is this useful?

7. The ambient occlusion and shadow rendering demonstrates the method's ability to render high-frequency visibility effects from the neural DDF. What properties of the DDF representation make this feasible?

8. The paper demonstrates improved disentangling of shading and albedo compared to baselines. What specific advantages does the method provide here over say a shadow network conditioned only on illumination and density?  

9. The results show evidence of geometry formed outside camera view frustums likely due to shadows. Can you analyse the qualitative results to hypothesize where and why this extra geometry gets formed?

10. Can you suggest any potential extensions or future work building on this method? For example, limitations to address or possible applications benefiting from differentiable outdoor visibility and illumination.
