# [VP3D: Unleashing 2D Visual Prompt for Text-to-3D Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing text-to-3D generation methods using score distillation sampling (SDS) struggle with generating high-quality 3D models from intricate text prompts. The models often produce distorted geometry, unrealistic textures, or cross-view inconsistency issues. 

- A core challenge is the substantial distribution gap between text and 3D modalities. Mapping text directly to 3D is difficult.

Method - VP3D:
- Proposes a visual prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model. First leverages a text-to-image model to generate a high-quality 2D image from the text prompt. 

- This image acts as a visual prompt to guide the 3D optimization process, alongside the original text prompt. The visual prompt bridges the gap between text and 3D distributions.

- Introduces a visual-prompted score distillation sampling (VP-SDS) loss to optimize the 3D model using knowledge distilled from a diffusion model conditioned on both text and visual prompts.

- Additional losses encourage rendering images from the 3D model to match the visual prompt (visual consistency) and text prompt (human feedback).

- Representation uses Instant-NGP for coarse 3D geometry and DMTet for high-quality texture and shape refinement.

Contributions:
- Novel visual prompt-guided framework for text-to-3D generation that leverages an intermediate 2D image to ease 3D learning.

- Visual-prompted score distillation sampling that conditions diffusion model on both text and visual prompts to optimize 3D model.

- Quantitative and qualitative experiments on T^3Bench benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation quality.

- Framework is versatile - can perform stylized text-to-3D generation by using an external reference image as the visual prompt.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel visual prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that first leverages 2D diffusion models to generate a high-quality image from text and then uses this image as a visual prompt to guide the optimization of a 3D model using visual-prompted score distillation sampling and additional reward functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing VP3D, a novel visual prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model. Specifically, VP3D introduces the following key ideas:

1) It first leverages 2D diffusion models to generate a high-quality image from the input text prompt. This image then acts as a visual prompt to guide the subsequent 3D generation process. 

2) It proposes a visual-prompted score distillation sampling (VP-SDS) loss to optimize the 3D model. VP-SDS incorporates both the visual prompt and text prompt to provide better supervision compared to standard score distillation sampling.

3) It introduces additional human feedback and visual consistency rewards to encourage the fidelity and alignment between the rendered 3D scenes with the visual and text prompts. 

4) It demonstrates VP3D's versatility in stylized text-to-3D generation, where a user-provided image can guide the generation of 3D assets that not only semantically match the text but also inherit the style of the image.

In summary, the core contribution is the proposal of harnessing 2D visual prompts to facilitate high-quality text-to-3D generation, enabled by the introduced VP-SDS loss and reward functions. Both quantitative and qualitative results validate the superiority of VP3D over previous text-to-3D techniques.

- Score distillation sampling (SDS): A technique to enable zero-shot text-to-3D generation by distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models to optimize a 3D model. 

- Visual-prompted score distillation sampling (VP-SDS): An upgrade to standard SDS that incorporates both text and visual prompts to guide the 3D optimization process.

- Differentiable reward functions: Additional losses introduced in VP3D including human feedback reward and visual consistency reward to encourage better alignment between the generated 3D assets and the visual/text prompts.

- Stylized text-to-3D generation: A new task showcased in the paper where VP3D can produce a stylized 3D model that not only semantically matches an input text prompt but also inherits the style from a reference image.

- T^3Bench: A recently proposed comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-to-3D generation methods.

In summary, the key focus of this paper is on augmenting standard text-to-3D pipelines with explicit visual prompt guidance to achieve higher-quality and more realistic 3D generation results.
