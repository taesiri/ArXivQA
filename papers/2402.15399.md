# [Distributionally Robust Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning: Provable   Efficiency with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of off-dynamics reinforcement learning, where a policy is trained on a source domain (e.g. simulator) and needs to perform well when deployed to a different but related target domain (e.g. real environment). The key challenge is the mismatch between the source and target domains, also known as the sim-to-real gap. The paper aims to solve this challenge using the framework of distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs).

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an online DRMDP approach, where the learning agent interacts with and explores the source domain, while optimizing a min-max objective that maximizes performance under the worst-case within an uncertainty set of transition models around the source domain. 

A key contribution is designing the first provably sample-efficient DRMDP algorithm with linear function approximation. This allows handling problems with large/infinite state spaces. However, they first show that the dual form of DRMDPs often introduces additional nonlinearity in the Q-function even for linear MDPs, causing errors to cascade in regret bounds. 

To resolve this, the paper introduces a $d$-rectangular uncertainty set based on total variation divergence that admits linear robust Q-functions. Under this setting, the paper further proposes an algorithm, DR-LSVI-UCB, that incorporates robust optimism by i) using a robust exploration bonus, and ii) truncating value functions at the fail state.

Main Results:
- Established the first non-asymptotic bounds on regret/suboptimality for online DRMDPs with linear function approximation. The bound is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d^2H^4/K})$ which nearly matches standard linear MDP bounds (extra $\sqrt{d}$ factor).
- Show linear robust Q-function representations are feasible under specific uncertainty sets like total variation. This bypasses cascading approximation errors in DRMDPs.
- Proposed an online optimistic algorithm DR-LSVI-UCB tailored for $d$-rectangular linear DRMDPs with convergence guarantees.
- Empirically showed improved robustness of DR-LSVI-UCB policies against distribution shift over standard RL baselines.

In summary, the paper makes an important first step towards bridging theory and practice in off-dynamics RL using online DRMDPs with linear function approximation.
