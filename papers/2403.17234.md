# [Speeding Up Path Planning via Reinforcement Learning in MCTS for   Automated Parking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17234)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Path planning for automated parking tasks is computationally expensive with sampling-based methods due to the need for dense sampling in high dimensional spaces to find optimal solutions. This makes real-time planning challenging.
- Methods to guide the search like heuristics are difficult to analytically design to work well across diverse and complex environments encountered in parking tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Integrate reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to speed up the search by leveraging learned guidance. 
- Formulate the parking path planning problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
- Design a MCTS framework customized for the automated parking path planning task, including node definitions, selection strategy, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation.
- Use a neural network to evaluate states by outputting a policy vector and value estimate. The network is trained on data generated from previous MCTS runs.
- MCTS acts as a policy improvement operator and the neural network evaluation acts as policy evaluation in a policy iteration framework.

Main Contributions:
- A way to integrate reinforcement learning with MCTS to guide the tree search without need for expert demonstrations.
- Custom design of the MCTS framework for automated parking path planning.
- Using the MCTS tree outcomes themselves as training data for the neural network in a self-improving system.
- Significantly reduced planning times compared to sampling-based methods like Hybrid A* while maintaining solution quality.
- Successful real-world deployment for automated parking in complex environments.

In summary, the key innovation is in using reinforcement learning to speed up MCTS for path planning in a self-improving fashion tailored for automated parking tasks. This results in much faster planning without compromising on solution quality.
