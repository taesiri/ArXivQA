# [Fast sampling from constrained spaces using the Metropolis-adjusted   Mirror Langevin Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08823)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new algorithm called the Metropolis-adjusted Mirror Langevin Algorithm (MAMLA) for sampling from distributions supported on compact, convex sets. MAMLA is based on adding an accept-reject step to the proposal distribution generated by one step of the Mirror Langevin Algorithm (MLA), which discretizes the continuous-time Mirror Langevin dynamics. Unlike MLA, MAMLA produces a Markov chain that is reversible with respect to the target distribution, eliminating the asymptotic bias issue of MLA. The authors prove mixing time bounds for MAMLA that depend on the conditioning of the target distribution and dimension, under assumptions on the smoothness and convexity of the potential function and the geometry of the domain induced by a self-concordant mirror function. A notable advantage of MAMLA is the superior polynomial rather than exponential dependence on the error tolerance in the mixing time compared to MLA and related methods. The paper discusses implementation details and applications of the algorithm like sampling from Dirichlet distributions. Numerical experiments validate that MAMLA mixes faster than MLA in practice and suggest the analysis may be conservative regarding scaling of the maximum step size with dimension.
