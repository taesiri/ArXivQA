# [Stronger Graph Transformer with Regularized Attention Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies in graph data due to issues like oversmoothing and oversquashing. This limits their effectiveness.

- Graph transformers were proposed to overcome this by using attention, but they are very memory intensive and lose graph structure information. Common solutions use positional encodings to encode structure, but this adds to the memory burden.

- Thus there is a need for methods that allow graph transformers to leverage graph structure without high memory overhead.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel "edge regularization" technique to enable graph transformers to incorporate graph structure without positional encodings. 

- The key idea is to add a regularization loss that encourages the graph transformer's attention scores to match the graph adjacency matrix. This acts as a structural bias.

- The loss uses an L1 or cross-entropy loss between the sigmoid attention scores and adjacency matrix. Backpropagation of this loss is cut off to not disrupt node representation learning.

Contributions:
- Introduces the idea of using an edge regularization loss to inject graph structure into graph transformers without positional encodings.

- Tests this on benchmark graph learning tasks and shows it helps most when no positional encoding is used, while positional encodings may interfere.

- Provides an analysis of graph transformer memory issues on a particle detector graph dataset, further motivating the need for efficient structural encoding.

- Overall explores a promising research direction to address graph transformer limitations, though further work is still needed to fully resolve memory complexity. The core idea of regularization for efficient structure encoding is the key takeaway.
