# [How Strong a Kick Should be to Topple Northeastern's Tumbling Robot?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Rough terrain locomotion, especially on steep and uneven surfaces like lunar craters, is very challenging for mobile robots. Most existing solutions like wheeled or legged robots have limitations. 
- NASA held a competition challenging teams to design innovative mobility systems to traverse bumpy lunar crater terrain. 

Proposed Solution:
- Northeastern University proposed COBRA, an articulated and deformable "rolling" robot that can perform tumbling locomotion.
- COBRA has 11 actuated joints. It can lock its head and tail sections together to form a loop shape to initiate controlled tumbling.
- Mathematical modeling is presented to analyze COBRA's kinetics during tumbling, relating its angular momentum to energy to determine how much force is needed to topple/steer it.

Key Contributions:
- COBRA won NASA's top award in the competition for its tumbling ability on steep and uneven terrain.
- It demonstrated stable passive tumbling at high speeds down a 24 degree 50 meter rocky slope.
- The head-tail locking mechanism and articulated design allows COBRA to actively control its configuration for initiating and steering the tumbling.
- The mathematical modeling provides insights into contact estimation and future control of the robot during tumbling.

In summary, COBRA provides an innovative bio-inspired solution using controlled tumbling over articulated joints to effectively traverse highly uneven and steep crater-like terrain that is challenging for other rover designs. The modeling and experiments demonstrate the feasibility and promise of this concept.
