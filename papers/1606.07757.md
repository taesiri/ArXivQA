# [A Taxonomy and Library for Visualizing Learned Features in Convolutional   Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07757)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main goal seems to be to provide a taxonomy of methods for visualizing features learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), as well as an open source library implementing some of these methods. Specifically, the authors:

- Propose a taxonomy dividing visualization methods into 3 main categories: Input Modification, Deconvolutional, and Input Reconstruction. They summarize the key papers and techniques in each category.

- Introduce the FeatureVis library for MATLAB's MatConvNet, which provides implementations of several visualization methods across the 3 proposed categories. 

- Use the library to compare visualizations across methods and network architectures, demonstrating how it can provide insights into what different networks learn.

So in summary, the central research contribution is a taxonomy organizing the growing literature on visualizing CNNs, as well as an open source library putting some of these visualization techniques into practice. The utility of this taxonomy and library is demonstrated through sample visualizations and comparisons.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a taxonomy of methods for visualizing features learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It divides these methods into three main classes: Input Modification, Deconvolutional, and Input Reconstruction. The Input Modification methods modify the input image to analyze the effect on activations, treating the network as a black box. The Deconvolutional methods propagate activations backwards through the network to determine the contribution of each input pixel. The Input Reconstruction methods reconstruct an input image that maximally activates a unit or matches a prior image's representation. The authors also introduce the open-source FeatureVis library for visualizing CNNs in MatConvNet. It implements methods from each class to help understand learned features and compare network architectures. The taxonomy provides a common terminology to discuss feature visualization research for CNNs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a taxonomy for methods to visualize features learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The taxonomy divides visualization methods into three main classes: Input Modification, Deconvolutional, and Input Reconstruction. Input Modification methods treat the CNN as a black box and modify the input to see how it affects activations and outputs. Deconvolutional methods propagate activations backwards through the network layers to determine the contribution of each input pixel. Input Reconstruction methods reconstruct inputs that maximize activations or match representations to reveal important features. 

The paper also presents FeatureVis, an open source library for MatConvNet implementing various visualization methods. It currently includes techniques from all three taxonomy classes like occlusion, guided backpropagation, and input reconstruction with regularization. Experiments demonstrate how FeatureVis can help compare networks and understand differences in performance. The library facilitates analysis and improvements of CNN architectures. Future work will expand the library and add real-time interactive visualizations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a taxonomy of feature visualization methods for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an open source library called FeatureVis for visualizing CNNs built with MatConvNet. 

The taxonomy divides feature visualization methods into three main classes:

1. Input Modification methods which modify the input image and measure changes in network output to determine important input features (e.g. occlusion).

2. Deconvolutional methods which propagate activations backwards through the network layers to determine each input pixel's contribution (e.g. deconvolution networks, guided backpropagation). 

3. Input Reconstruction methods which reconstruct inputs that maximally activate certain units to reveal important features (e.g. inversion through gradient descent or generative networks).

The paper introduces the FeatureVis library which implements methods from each class to visualize features learned by CNNs built with MatConvNet. The library facilitates understanding and comparing different networks and can be easily extended.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main goals of the paper are:

1. To propose a taxonomy that categorizes and compares different methods for visualizing features learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The taxonomy divides methods into three main classes: Input Modification, Deconvolutional, and Input Reconstruction.

2. To introduce an open source library called FeatureVis for visualizing CNNs built with MatConvNet. The library implements several visualization methods from the proposed taxonomy to help analyze CNN models.

3. To facilitate understanding and improvement of CNN architectures through visualization of learned features. The paper shows examples of using FeatureVis to compare visualizations across different network architectures.

So in summary, the key problems/questions addressed are: how to categorize and compare different visualization techniques, how to make these techniques easily usable, and how visualization can aid in analyzing and improving neural network models. The taxonomy, FeatureVis library, and examples aim to make progress on these fronts.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a taxonomy for feature visualization techniques in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and introduces an open-source library called FeatureVis for implementing these techniques in MatConvNet. The taxonomy categorizes visualization methods into three main classes: Input Modification, Deconvolutional, and Input Reconstruction. Input Modification perturbs the input and observes changes in activations, treating the CNN as a black box. Deconvolutional methods propagate activations backwards through the network to determine pixel-wise contributions. Input Reconstruction finds an input that maximizes activation of a unit, revealing its preferred features. The paper summarizes key papers in each category. The FeatureVis library implements several visualization methods from the three classes and can be readily applied to any CNN built with MatConvNet. Experiments demonstrate FeatureVis’ ability to compare visualization techniques and analyze differences between network architectures. The library facilitates understanding and improvement of CNNs through visual analysis. Overall, the taxonomy provides a unified terminology and structure for feature visualization research, while the FeatureVis library enables practical application of these techniques.
