# [BIMCV-R: A Landmark Dataset for 3D CT Text-Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15992)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- 3D medical imaging is increasingly used in healthcare, greatly increasing clinicians' workload. Systems to retrieve similar case studies would help alleviate this burden, but the field lacks robust benchmarks and curated 3D medical image-text datasets.

Solution: 
- The paper presents BIMCV-R, the first publicly accessible English dataset with 8,069 3D CT scan and radiology report pairs covering 96 diseases. 
- It introduces MedFinder, a dual-stream network leveraging large language models to connect images and reports for text-image retrieval. This enables text-to-image, image-to-text, and keyword-based retrieval.

Main Contributions:
1) Curates BIMCV-R, the first public 3D medical text-image CT dataset with authentic radiological reports and disease diagnoses.
2) Develops MedFinder for medical retrieval, harnessing large language models to connect images and reports. Enables text-image, image-text, and keyword retrieval on a real-world medical dataset.
3) Showcases potential of large language models to enhance 3D medical image retrieval, setting new standards for future research. 

The BIMCV-R dataset and MedFinder framework push forward the field of 3D medical image analysis and retrieval. They provide researchers benchmarking resources and showcase an approach exploiting large language models' capabilities for relating medical images and text.
