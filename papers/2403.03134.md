# [Simplicity in Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual complexity of images plays an important role in cognitive processes like attention and memorability. However, complexity is poorly understood.  
- Past models use either complex combinations of handcrafted features or opaque deep neural networks, failing to provide interpretability or a theoretical understanding.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a simple linear model to predict image complexity using two segmentation-based features:
    1) num_seg - the number of segments in an image detected by state-of-the-art segmentation model SAM.
    2) num_class - the number of named class instances detected by FC-CLIP.
- They apply square root transformation to these counts before linear combination.

Results:
- The model achieves Spearman correlation of 0.73-0.89 with human judgments across 6 diverse image datasets, outperforming prior handcrafted and neural baselines.
- It shows comparable performance to a supervised neural network directly optimized for complexity.
- Analysis reveals complexity increases with number of segments and classes.

Limitations:
- Fails to account for visual structure like symmetry which reduces complexity. Adding patch-symmetry feature helps address this.
- Dependent on accuracy of segmentation models.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a simple, generalizable and interpretable account of image complexity using modern segmentation models. 
- Shows complexity can be surprisingly simple given an appropriate representation based on segments and classes.
- Segment-based features could likely extend to other perceptual judgments like memorability.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that just the number of segments and named classes estimated by state-of-the-art segmentation models is sufficient to predict human complexity judgments across multiple image domains, framing a simpler perspective of complexity.
