# [Simplicity in Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Visual complexity of images plays an important role in cognitive processes like attention and memorability. However, complexity is poorly understood.  
- Past models use either complex combinations of handcrafted features or opaque deep neural networks, failing to provide interpretability or a theoretical understanding.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a simple linear model to predict image complexity using two segmentation-based features:
    1) num_seg - the number of segments in an image detected by state-of-the-art segmentation model SAM.
    2) num_class - the number of named class instances detected by FC-CLIP.
- They apply square root transformation to these counts before linear combination.

Results:
- The model achieves Spearman correlation of 0.73-0.89 with human judgments across 6 diverse image datasets, outperforming prior handcrafted and neural baselines.
- It shows comparable performance to a supervised neural network directly optimized for complexity.
- Analysis reveals complexity increases with number of segments and classes.

Limitations:
- Fails to account for visual structure like symmetry which reduces complexity. Adding patch-symmetry feature helps address this.
- Dependent on accuracy of segmentation models.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a simple, generalizable and interpretable account of image complexity using modern segmentation models. 
- Shows complexity can be surprisingly simple given an appropriate representation based on segments and classes.
- Segment-based features could likely extend to other perceptual judgments like memorability.

In summary, the paper demonstrates that just the number of segments and named classes estimated by state-of-the-art segmentation models is sufficient to predict human complexity judgments across multiple image domains, framing a simpler perspective of complexity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a simple, interpretable model of visual complexity of natural images based on just two features - the number of semantic segments and semantic classes extracted from state-of-the-art neural network segmentation models - which generalizes well across diverse image datasets, supporting the surprising hypothesis that complexity can be simple.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective model to predict the perceived complexity of natural images. Specifically:

1) The paper shows that just two segmentation-based features - the number of segments and number of classes extracted using state-of-the-art segmentation models - can predict human complexity judgments surprisingly well across multiple natural image datasets. 

2) The proposed model outperforms previous approaches using handcrafted features or neural networks directly optimized for complexity prediction. This suggests that complexity is well captured by segmentation representations.  

3) The model is highly interpretable, allowing clear attribution of complexity scores to the contributing image segments and classes. This facilitates diagnosing failures and limitations.

4) The work elucidates that despite the subjective and complex nature of perceived complexity, it can be explained by a simple linear combination of segment-based features. This lends support to the idea that segment-based representations are relevant to internal cognitive representations.

In summary, the paper makes a case for a parsimonious yet powerful account of perceived visual complexity grounded in state-of-the-art computer vision. The simplicity of the model opens avenues for further theoretical and computational investigations.

The paper presents a model to predict the perceived complexity of natural images using two main features - the number of segments and number of classes - extracted from state-of-the-art segmentation models. It shows that just these two interpretable features can predict complexity surprisingly well across multiple image datasets. The paper also discusses the limitations of only using segments, and the need to incorporate concepts like image structure and symmetry into the model. Overall, it aims to develop a simple and interpretable account of visual complexity based on segmentation representations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes that image complexity can be modeled surprisingly simply using segment-based representations. What are the key advantages of using segmentation models like SAM and FC-CLIP to extract complexity-relevant features compared to previous methods based on handcrafted features or neural network activations?

2. The paper finds that just two features - the square root of the number of segments and the square root of the number of classes - can explain a large proportion of variance in complexity judgments across multiple image sets. Why might a square root transform on these counts work well compared to using the raw counts?

3. The paper shows strong performance of the model on natural scenes and art images, but poorer performance on spatially structured images like the VISC dataset. What aspect of structured images does the model fail to account for, and how is this addressed by adding the patch-symmetry feature?

4. The model has limitations based on the accuracy of the segmentation models used. Can you suggest some ways in which future improvements in segmentation models like SAM and FC-CLIP might further improve complexity prediction?

5. Could the model be extended to capture individual differences in complexity perception by fine-tuning the segmentation models or regression model itself? What kind of data might allow for such personalization?  

6. How might the interpretability and attribution capabilities of the model (as shown in Figure 4) be useful for practical applications compared to opaque neural network models?

7. The paper speculates that complexity judgments likely differ between art experts versus novices. How might you design an experiment to test differences in the perceptual segments and mapping to complexity between these groups?  

8. Why might a complexity model based on scene graphs or generative scene programs be more robust compared to counting segments and classes? What challenges would need to be overcome to build such a model?

9. Could the segment-counting approach be extended to model perceptual phenomena beyond just complexity, such as memorability or aesthetics? What additional considerations might be important?

10. The model uses pre-trained segmentation models like SAM and FC-CLIP that have been trained on human annotations. What are the pros and cons of using such foundation models compared to training segmentation models from scratch specifically for predicting complexity?
