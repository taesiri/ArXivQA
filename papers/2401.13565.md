# [Large Malaysian Language Model Based on Mistral for Enhanced Local   Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13565)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper addresses the lack of large-scale language models tailored for the Malaysian context, which hinders progress in Malay natural language processing research and applications. Most existing models exhibit an English-centric bias with minimal Malay language data representation.

Proposed Solution  
The authors fine-tune and further pretrain the open-sourced Mistral 7B model on a substantial 32.6GB Malaysian dataset to create a model called "Malaysian Mistral." Key solutions include:

- Pretraining on datasets encompassing Wikipedia articles, Malaysian government documents, online articles, dictionaries, etc. 

- Implementing deduplication using MinHash algorithm and rigorous data cleaning.

- Releasing variants with context lengths of 4096, 32768 tokens, and a specialized 16384 context length instruction-tuned model.

- Performing full parameter tuning focused on Malaysian chat interactions and question-answering. 

Main Contributions
- Creation and release of Malaysian Mistral, a 7B parameter model tailored for Malaysian language needs.

- Demonstrating performance improvements from model tuning, with state-of-the-art capabilities surpassing ChatGPT3.5 on a Tatabahasa test set. 

- Releasing instruction-tuned models exhibiting strong performance on coding questions translated from English to Malay.

- Contribution of model code, training methodology, and benchmark results to the open-source community.

- Showcasing Malaysian Mistral's efficacy and commitment to advancing accessible AI solutions tailored for the Malaysian context.

In summary, the paper presents Malaysian Mistral, a milestone advancement in Malay language modeling, achieved through rigorous tuning of Mistral 7B. The solutions, benchmarking and open-sourced assets solidify Malaysian Mistral's capabilities while fostering inclusivity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the development of Malaysian Mistral, a large-scale pre-trained language model for the Malay language, through extensive pretraining and finetuning on a 32.6GB Malaysian-centric dataset to enhance language understanding capabilities tailored for local contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation and release of Malaysian Mistral, a large-scale language model fine-tuned specifically for the Malaysian context. The paper details the extensive pretraining and finetuning process undertaken to tailor Mistral 7B to better understand the nuances of the Malay language and Malaysian culture.

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Fine-tuning of Mistral 7B using over 32GB of Malaysian text data, with context lengths of 4096 and 32768 tokens. This adaptation to local context is a major focus.

2) Release of specialized instruction-tuned Malaysian Mistral models with 16384 token contexts to better capture linguistic nuances. 

3) Benchmarking demonstrating Malaysian Mistral's superior performance over Claude 2 and ChatGPT 3.5 on a Tatabahasa test set, showing its strength in handling grammar.

4) Open-sourcing of all models, data and code to enable further research and accessibility of large language models for the Malaysian context.

In summary, the paper's main contribution is the creation and release of Malaysian Mistral to address the limitations of English-centric models and provide an advanced, locally-optimized language model tailored specifically for Malaysia.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using 8 A100 GPUs during pretraining. Can you elaborate on the specific hardware configuration and infrastructure used? What were some challenges faced in setting up and utilizing this high-performance computing environment?

2. When creating the synthetic instruction datasets in Section 3.2.1, what techniques did you use to ensure high quality and diversity of prompts and responses? How did you validate that the generated datasets were natural, coherent, and challenging?  

3. You employed Neural Machine Translation for translating text between languages like Indonesian, Malay and English. Can you explain the architecture, training methodology and benchmarks for the translation models used? What accuracy levels did you achieve?

4. In the deduplication of scraped datasets using MinHash, how did you arrive at the specific parameter values chosen? What tradeoffs did you consider between redundancy removal and preservation of linguistic diversity? 

5. When preprocessing the datasets before training, what cleansing steps did you take beyond just normalization of whitespace and punctuation? Were there any language-specific nuances that needed special handling?

6. During pretraining, how did you determine optimal context lengths of 4096 and 32768 tokens? What differences did you observe in model performance and training efficiency between these context lengths?

7. For the synthetic grammar error dataset, what modifications did you make to the Malaya dependency parser to deliberately induce realistic errors? How did you ensure the errors resembled natural mistakes?  

8. In Section 4.2.1, you generated synthetic commonsense QA datasets. Did you take any measures to avoid biases and ensure fair representation of demographic groups within the generated data?

9. You fine-tuned Malaysian Mistral with a 16384 context length instruction dataset. What was the motivation behind choosing this specific context length? How much compute resources were needed for fine-tuning at this scale?

10. The paper benchmarks performance on a Tatabahasa test set. Could you share more details on the composition and creation of this test set? What other benchmarks were used to evaluate language understanding abilities?
