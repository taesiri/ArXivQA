# [TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01622)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prior AI agents have struggled with planning in complex, real-world settings like humans can. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in areas like tool use and reasoning. This raises the question - can these language agents handle more complex planning tasks beyond the reach of previous AI? 

To investigate this question, the authors propose a new benchmark called "TravelPlanner" focusing on travel planning, a common yet challenging real-world planning task for humans. Travel planning involves many constraints (budget, user needs etc), requires gathering information from various tools (to search flights, hotels etc.), and handling the long-horizon nature of multi-day trip planning.

Methodology:
The TravelPlanner benchmark provides a sandbox environment with around 4 million entries of travel data that can be accessed via 6 search tools. It also includes 1225 carefully curated travel planning queries (and reference plans), capturing diverse constraints like budget, cuisine preferences etc. 

The benchmark comprehensively evaluates language agents on their ability to:
(1) Successfully deliver a complete travel plan. 
(2) Gather relevant information using the right tools.
(3) Satisfy various commonsense and user-specified constraints.

Key Results:
The authors evaluated several LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-4, Mixtral) and planning strategies (ReAct, Reflexion). The key findings are:

- Even the most capable LLM (GPT-4) achieved only 0.6% success rate in delivering complete valid plans. Other LLMs failed on all tasks.
- The agents struggled to stay on task, improperly used tools, got stuck in loops, and failed to satisfy constraints.
- Existing planning strategies were also insufficient to handle the complexity of the benchmark's tasks.

To summarize, the TravelPlanner benchmark poses a significant challenge for current LLMs and planning methods. But the possibility for agents to attempt such complex planning itself represents interesting progress. The benchmark can motivate developing more sophisticated planning capabilities among language agents.
