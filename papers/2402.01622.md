# [TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01622)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prior AI agents have struggled with planning in complex, real-world settings like humans can. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in areas like tool use and reasoning. This raises the question - can these language agents handle more complex planning tasks beyond the reach of previous AI? 

To investigate this question, the authors propose a new benchmark called "TravelPlanner" focusing on travel planning, a common yet challenging real-world planning task for humans. Travel planning involves many constraints (budget, user needs etc), requires gathering information from various tools (to search flights, hotels etc.), and handling the long-horizon nature of multi-day trip planning.

Methodology:
The TravelPlanner benchmark provides a sandbox environment with around 4 million entries of travel data that can be accessed via 6 search tools. It also includes 1225 carefully curated travel planning queries (and reference plans), capturing diverse constraints like budget, cuisine preferences etc. 

The benchmark comprehensively evaluates language agents on their ability to:
(1) Successfully deliver a complete travel plan. 
(2) Gather relevant information using the right tools.
(3) Satisfy various commonsense and user-specified constraints.

Key Results:
The authors evaluated several LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-4, Mixtral) and planning strategies (ReAct, Reflexion). The key findings are:

- Even the most capable LLM (GPT-4) achieved only 0.6% success rate in delivering complete valid plans. Other LLMs failed on all tasks.
- The agents struggled to stay on task, improperly used tools, got stuck in loops, and failed to satisfy constraints.
- Existing planning strategies were also insufficient to handle the complexity of the benchmark's tasks.

To summarize, the TravelPlanner benchmark poses a significant challenge for current LLMs and planning methods. But the possibility for agents to attempt such complex planning itself represents interesting progress. The benchmark can motivate developing more sophisticated planning capabilities among language agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces TravelPlanner, a new benchmark to assess language agents' capability in complex, real-world planning tasks like multi-day travel itinerary creation under various constraints, finding even the most advanced models struggle to handle such challenges.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new benchmark called TravelPlanner for evaluating the planning and tool-use capabilities of language agents in complex, real-world scenarios. Specifically:

- TravelPlanner focuses on the task of travel planning, which involves long-horizon planning with many interdependent decisions, multiple constraints (user needs, budgets, etc.), and requires using various tools to gather information from a large sandbox environment. This represents a more complex, realistic planning setting compared to prior benchmarks.

- The paper introduces a dataset of 1225 diverse travel planning queries along with reference plans, as well as a rich sandbox environment with around 4 million data records that can be accessed via 6 tools. 

- Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate various LLMs (e.g. GPT-3, GPT-4) and planning strategies on the TravelPlanner benchmark. The key findings are that even the most advanced models struggle with such complex planning - for example GPT-4 only achieves 0.6% success rate.

- The paper analyzes the failure modes of current systems, revealing challenges like inability to correct initial assumptions, confusion when dealing with large information, and disconnects between reasoning and actions.

- TravelPlanner represents significant progress as a testbed for developing more capable language agents that can handle complex, human-level planning. Even though current agents struggle, the ability to attempt such tasks is itself a non-trivial feat.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal and analysis of TravelPlanner, a new benchmark to advance research towards human-level planning agents.

The paper introduces a new benchmark called "TravelPlanner" for evaluating the capability of language agents powered by large language models to handle complex, real-world planning tasks like travel planning. It focuses on the constraints, tool use, and planning strategies involved in such tasks. Key metrics used include delivery rate and different types of pass rates. The paper analyzes the performance of different LLMs and planning strategies on this benchmark in both a two-stage mode involving information collection and planning, as well as a simplified sole-planning mode. It also discusses common failure modes of current language agents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a new benchmark called TravelPlanner for evaluating the planning capabilities of language agents. What are some key advantages of using a travel planning task compared to more traditional planning benchmarks? How does it allow more comprehensive assessment of an agent's skills?

2) The paper discusses the importance of incorporating constraints like budget, user needs, commonsense constraints, etc. when evaluating planning. Why are these constraints critical for developing human-level planning skills in agents? How does TravelPlanner ensure these different constraints are adequately captured?  

3) The paper finds that none of the current LLMs are able to successfully complete the TravelPlanner benchmark. What are some key limitations you see with LLMs that prevent them from effectively planning under complex real-world constraints? 

4) The paper evaluates planning strategies like ReAct and Reflexion along with different LLMs. Why do you think these strategies also struggle on TravelPlanner compared to simpler planning tasks? What enhancements would you suggest to make them more capable?

5) Tool use is an integral part of the TravelPlanner benchmark. What are some common tool use errors made by agents discussed in the paper? How can we enhance an agent's capability to effectively leverage different tools to aid planning?

6) The paper discusses how agents often struggle with constraints like budget and minimum nights stay that require more global, forward-looking planning. What techniques can potentially help agents perform better at such constraints? 

7) One interesting observation is that agents take much less time to generate plans compared to humans, even though their quality is poorer. How can we effectively combine an agent's efficiency with human-level planning quality? What role can semi-automated planning play here?

8) The TravelPlanner dataset contains rich information spread across millions of data records accessible via different tools. What are some ways we can enhance an agent's capability to search through and deliberate over such large volumes of information?

9) The paper also evaluates agents in a simplified sole-planning setting. What purpose does comparing performance in the two settings serve? What additional insights do we gain about an agent's strengths and weaknesses?

10) The case studies highlight some common failure modes like repetitive errors, hallucinations, etc. What steps should be taken by the community to systematically address and mitigate these failure modes in future work?
