# [Particle Denoising Diffusion Sampler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06320)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper considers the problem of sampling from an unnormalized density $\pi(x)=\gamma(x)/\mathcal{Z}$, where $\gamma(x)$ can be evaluated pointwise but the normalizing constant $\mathcal{Z}$ is intractable. The goal is to develop a sampling scheme that can approximately sample from $\pi(x)$ and estimate $\mathcal{Z}$.

Proposed Solution: 
The main idea is to transport $\pi(x)$ to a Gaussian distribution through a "noising" diffusion, then try to reverse this process to sample from $\pi(x)$. However, exactly reversing the diffusion requires knowing the intractable score functions. The paper proposes an iterative particle-based scheme called Particle Denoising Diffusion Sampler (PDDS) to approximate the time-reversed diffusion:

1) Discretize the forward/noising diffusion into time steps. Propagate particles backwards in time approximately using a learned potential function.

2) Reweight particles at each step using importance sampling. Resample particles based on weights.

3) Refine the potential function by matching the score on the particle approximation of $\pi(x)$ using a novel loss.

4) Repeat steps 1-3 iteratively to improve estimates.

This provides an asymptotically consistent estimate of $\pi(x)$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ under mild assumptions, unlike previous score matching approaches.

Main Contributions:

- Adapts the idea of denoising diffusions with guidance to sampling problems with unnormalized densities

- Provides theoretical analysis quantifying the approximation error 

- Develops PDDS algorithm to iteratively approximate the time-reversed diffusion 

- Introduces a new score matching loss that helps reduce variance

- Demonstrates improved performance over baselines on challenging multimodal and high-dimensional tasks

The key novelty is the development of PDDS which leverages score matching ideas to provide consistent estimates without access to samples from the target density. The theoretical analysis also formally establishes benefits over standard guidance approximations.
