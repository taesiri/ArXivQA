# [ImplicitDeepfake: Plausible Face-Swapping through Implicit Deepfake   Generation using NeRF and Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06390)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deepfakes can be used to create realistic but fake videos/images of people by swapping their face into existing media. This has sparked controversies around the potential misuse of such technologies. 
- Existing deepfake methods operate primarily in 2D, manipulating images and videos. Generating fake 3D avatars that can be rendered from any viewpoint remains challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method called "ImplicitDeepfake" that combines deepfakes with neural 3D graphics techniques like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to generate plausible 3D deepfake avatars.  
- It first runs a 2D deepfake algorithm on a set of images depicting a 3D face from different viewpoints. This replaces the face with a target celebrity's face consistently across images.
- These modified images are then used to train a NeRF or Gaussian Splatting model to obtain a full 3D deepfaked avatar that can be rendered realistically from arbitrary viewpoints.

Key Contributions:
- First method to produce 3D deepfake avatars via neural rendering using modified images.
- Shows that swapping faces in 2D consistently enables direct application of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting to obtain 3D deepfakes.
- Evaluates quality of resulting avatars compared to real target images and 2D deepfakes baseline. Gaussian Splatting can produce higher quality renders.
- Simple yet effective approach combining classical 2D deepfakes with state-of-the-art graphics methods like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting.

In summary, the paper presents a novel idea and framework to generate 3D deepfake avatars by integrating deepfake technologies with neural 3D graphics methods. It demonstrates promising results, opening up potential future work on applications and analysis of such synthetic 3D entities.
