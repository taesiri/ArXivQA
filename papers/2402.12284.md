# [Refining Minimax Regret for Unsupervised Environment Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses a key limitation with unsupervised environment design (UED) methods based on minimax regret. These methods train an adversary to generate levels that maximize the agent's regret - the difference between the optimal policy's performance and the agent's performance. At equilibrium, this results in a minimax regret (MMR) policy that has theoretically bounded worst-case regret. 

However, once the agent reaches the regret bound on all levels, the adversary will only sample the subset of levels with highest/irreducible regret. Although the agent could still improve on other non-highest regret levels, learning stagnates as the agent only sees the highest regret levels. This is problematic when:
(1) A single policy cannot be simultaneously optimal on all levels 
(2) There exist levels with lower but reducible regret that the agent could still improve on

The authors refer to this issue where regret-based UED methods stop improving prematurely as the \textit{regret stagnation problem}.

Solution - Bayesian Level-Perfect MMR:
To address regret stagnation, the authors propose Bayesian level-perfect MMR (BLP) which refines the MMR objective. The key ideas are:

- Define the \textit{refined MMR game} which, given a policy $\pi$ and subset of levels $\Theta'$, optimizes regret only over trajectories not possible under $\pi$ and $\Theta'$ (but maintains $\pi$'s behavior over trajectories from $\Theta'$).

- Show iteratively solving this game retains global MMR guarantees while monotonically improving regret over previously unsampled levels.

- A BLP policy solves the refined game repeatedly until all levels are covered. By construction, BLP acts optimally like a perfect Bayesian policy over all trajectories.

Contributions:
1) Identify and characterize regret stagnation issue in standard minimax regret UED

2) Propose BLP objective that retains MMR guarantees while continually improving over non-highest regret levels 

3) Develop ReMiDi algorithm to obtain BLP policy

4) Empirically demonstrate regret stagnation and that ReMiDi outperforms regret-based UED methods

Overall, BLP enables applying UED to larger and more open-ended environments where irreducible regret is likely by avoiding stagnation issues and continually improving the policy.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a refinement of the minimax regret objective for unsupervised environment design to address the issue of regret stagnation, where learning prematurely stops due to continually sampling environments with irreducible regret.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Theoretically introducing and characterising the regret stagnation problem in minimax regret unsupervised environment design (UED). This refers to the issue where minimax regret can cause learning to prematurely stagnate if regret does not correspond to learnability.

2. Proposing Bayesian level-perfect minimax regret (BLP), a refinement of minimax regret for UED. BLP retains global minimax regret guarantees, while additionally obtaining minimax regret-like guarantees under trajectories that do not occur in high-regret levels. 

3. Introducing ReMiDi, a proof-of-concept algorithm that solves the BLP objective and returns a BLP policy.

4. Empirically demonstrating that in settings with high irreducible regret, ReMiDi significantly outperforms standard regret-based UED methods that suffer from regret stagnation.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of Bayesian level-perfect minimax regret to address the issue of regret stagnation in minimax regret UED, along with an algorithm to achieve it. This enables more effective use of UED in larger and more open-ended settings.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "Bayesian level-perfect minimax regret" (BLP). Can you explain in detail what this concept means and how it differs from standard minimax regret? What are the theoretical guarantees provided by achieving a BLP policy?

2. The regret stagnation problem is a key issue identified with standard minimax regret. Can you clearly summarize what this problem is and why it can hinder learning in some cases? Provide a concrete example to illustrate the issue.  

3. The paper proposes an iterative refinement procedure to obtain a BLP policy. Walk through the details of this refinement procedure. In particular, explain how policies and adversarial distributions are updated across iterations and what the convergence criteria is. 

4. Theorem 1 introduces the "refined minimax regret game". Carefully explain what this game represents and why solving it iteratively helps address regret stagnation. What result does Theorem 1 prove about the solution to this game?

5. How does Theorem 2, the Minimax Regret Refinement Theorem, build upon Theorem 1? Clearly state parts (a), (b), and (c) of Theorem 2 and interpret what they mean. Why is this an important result?

6. Explain the connection shown between BLP policies and Perfect Bayesian policies in Theorem 3. Why does this connection matter - what does it tell us about BLP policies?

7. Walk through the ReMiDi algorithm in detail, explaining each component and how it operationally achieves a BLP policy. What are some alternative adversary or policy combination approaches that could be used?

8. The BLP objective requires knowing if a trajectory is possible under a policy and set of levels. Why is this challenging in practice and how does ReMiDi approximate this? Suggest another method to tractably estimate trajectory likelihoods.  

9. In the tabular experiment, compare the behavior of standard minimax regret UED and ReMiDi in both the distinguishable and indistinguishable cases. How do the results demonstrate the limitations of minimax regret?

10. How does ReMiDi build upon and extend standard minimax regret UED approaches? What are some promising directions and open questions for further developing the ReMiDi approach?
