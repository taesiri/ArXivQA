# [Fairness Certification for Natural Language Processing and Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Fairness certification for natural language processing (NLP) approaches like large language models, AI chatbots or healthcare applications is an important and unresolved issue. It is challenging to define suitable certification criteria from a practitioner's perspective due to:

- Many conflicting definitions of fairness exist 
- Unclear which fairness criteria are relevant for NLP 
- Prior work on fairness auditing focuses on quantitative metrics without considering procedural or qualitative aspects

Thus, the research question is: What criteria are relevant to consider for fairness certification for NLP approaches from a practitioner's point of view?

Methodology: 
The authors conduct a literature review on NLP fairness, AI fairness and fairness auditing. Then they develop a concept for semi-structured interviews with stakeholders based on this literature review. 14 interviews are conducted with mostly NLP experts from industry and 2 algorithmic fairness experts from academia. The interview transcripts are analyzed using open and axial coding to devise a hierarchical coding scheme for NLP fairness certification criteria.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a coding scheme with 6 main criteria and 18 sub-criteria that are relevant for certifying the fairness of an NLP system:

Main criteria:
1. Process criteria 
2. Governance criteria  
3. Project planning criteria
4. Data-related criteria  
5. Modeling & evaluation criteria
6. Operations criteria

The sub-criteria provide more nuanced aspects to audit under each main criteria. For example, under data-related criteria, sub-criteria include data assessment, annotation, preprocessing, data storage etc.  

The coding scheme considers criteria both from the auditor's and the audited organization's perspective. It covers the entire NLP development life cycle. The authors argue it provides a foundation to operationalize and test fairness certification processes.

Contributions:

1. Extensive literature review structuring research on NLP fairness, AI fairness and fairness auditing

2. Qualitative research method to derive certification criteria based on 14 expert interviews

3. Hierarchical coding scheme with 6 main and 18 sub-criteria for certifying fairness of NLP systems 

4. Practitioner-focused criteria spanning the auditor's and audited organization's perspectives

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution towards establishing standardized fairness certification processes for NLP systems by proposing certification criteria grounded in literature and expert interviews.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper devises a hierarchical coding scheme with six main criteria and 18 sub-criteria for certifying the fairness of natural language processing approaches, based on a literature review and 14 expert interviews covering the entire life cycle of NLP systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is devising a hierarchical coding scheme for the certification of fairness for natural language processing (NLP) approaches. Specifically, the paper:

1) Conducts and analyzes 14 semi-structured expert interviews to identify relevant criteria for certifying the fairness of NLP systems. The experts come mostly from industry and two from academia with background in algorithmic fairness.

2) Structures the interview findings into a coding scheme with 6 main criteria categories: Process Criteria, Governance Criteria, Project Planning Criteria, Data-Related Criteria, Modeling & Evaluation Criteria, and Operations Criteria. 

3) Further breaks down the 6 main criteria into 18 sub-criteria on the second level of the hierarchy. For example, Process Criteria contains Fairness Understanding, Certification Market Factors, and Design of Assessment as sub-criteria.

4) Provides an overview of all the criteria and sub-criteria, explaining what concepts they encompass based on the interview analysis. 

In summary, the main contribution is devising a comprehensive, hierarchical coding scheme for certifying the fairness of NLP systems based on literature review and expert interviews. This scheme offers a foundation for operationalizing and testing fairness certification processes from both the auditor's and the audited organization's perspectives.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms are:

- Fairness
- Certification
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- Algorithmic fairness
- AI auditing
- Semi-structured interviews
- Coding scheme
- Process criteria
- Governance criteria  
- Project planning criteria
- Data-related criteria
- Modeling and evaluation criteria
- Operations criteria

The paper conducts semi-structured expert interviews to devise a hierarchical coding scheme with criteria relevant for certifying the fairness of NLP approaches. The coding scheme contains six main criteria categories: process criteria, governance criteria, project planning criteria, data-related criteria, modeling and evaluation criteria, and operations criteria. Each of these encompasses further sub-criteria. The goal is to provide a basis for auditing and certifying the fairness of NLP systems from the perspective of both the auditor and the audited organization.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper takes a qualitative research approach to devising certification criteria. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to a quantitative methods? How could the findings be supplemented with quantitative analysis?

2. The paper identifies 6 top-level criteria and 18 second-level criteria for NLP fairness certification. In your view, are there any major certification criteria missing? What other categories might be relevant to consider?  

3. The paper discusses the subjectivity and cultural dependence of fairness perceptions. How should an NLP fairness certification process account for differing cultural norms while still establishing meaningful criteria?

4. The interview findings highlight many interdependencies between fairness and other AI principles like transparency, privacy, and reliability. Should NLP fairness certification be integrated with certifications for these other principles? Why or why not?

5. The paper proposes both process-based and technical criteria for NLP fairness certification. In your opinion, what is the right balance between evaluating organizational processes versus evaluating system outputs?

6. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops are proposed to maintain fairness over time. What are some key challenges in operationalizing these mechanisms? How frequent and extensive should fairness reassessments be?  

7. The paper discusses using risk profiles to determine the scope and rigor of certification processes. What factors should define the risk level? Who should make this determination?

8. Voluntary self-assessments versus mandatory independent audits are debated for certification. What are advantages and disadvantages of each? When if ever should mandatory certifications be required?

9. The interview findings emphasize employee training and diverse teams. Beyond assessing processes, should NLP certifications also evaluate individualsâ€™ qualifications? What ethical issues might this raise?

10. The paper focuses on NLP but discusses expanding scope to cover all AI systems. Would the proposed criteria sufficiently generalize? What adaptations might be needed?
