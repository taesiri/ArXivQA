# [Learning to Fuse Monocular and Multi-view Cues for Multi-frame Depth   Estimation in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08993)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How to improve multi-frame depth estimation in dynamic scenes by better utilizing and fusing both monocular and multi-view depth cues? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Multi-view cues capture more accurate geometric information in static areas while monocular cues capture more useful contexts in dynamic areas. 

2) Properly fusing the complementary benefits of both cues can lead to significant improvement in depth estimation accuracy in dynamic scenes over using either cue alone.

3) Learning to fuse the cues in a mask-free manner using the proposed cross-cue attention mechanism can better utilize their respective advantages compared to using heuristic masks or simple fusion techniques.

So in summary, the paper aims to show that the proposed cross-cue fusion technique can effectively combine the strengths of monocular and multi-view depth cues to achieve state-of-the-art depth estimation performance in challenging dynamic scenes. The key novelty lies in the mask-free attention-based fusion approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel method to improve multi-frame dynamic depth estimation by fusing multi-view and monocular depth cues. 

2. It introduces a cross-cue fusion (CCF) module that utilizes cross-cue attention to encode non-local intra-relations from one depth cue to guide the representation of the other. This allows propagating geometric information from multi-view cues to monocular cues and enhancing monocular cues with multi-view relations.

3. Experiments show the proposed method achieves significant improvement upon state-of-the-art methods in dynamic depth estimation on KITTI dataset, with 21.3% error reduction. It also demonstrates better generalization ability on the DDAD dataset compared to other methods.

In summary, the key innovation is the cross-cue fusion module that effectively combines multi-view and monocular depth cues in a learnable way, without needing explicit masks. This leads to superior performance in dynamic depth estimation while retaining strong overall accuracy. The ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the proposed method.
