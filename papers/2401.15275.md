# [Dynamic Transformer Architecture for Continual Learning of Multimodal   Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Transformers have become prevalent for multimodal vision-and-language (VaL) tasks like VQA. But fine-tuning them for each task weakens generalization while storing multiple task-specific versions is infeasible as models grow bigger. 
- Continual learning (CL) allows learning multiple tasks sequentially using a shared model. But existing CL methods focus only on vision or language tasks, not multimodal ones. Addressing multimodality poses distinct challenges due to differences in modalities.

Proposed Solution: 
- A transformer-based continual learning framework called TAM-CL for learning a sequence of VaL tasks using a shared model.

- Leverages dynamic model expansion via task-specific attention layers. For each new task, a trainable task token is introduced which specializes a base transformer for that task. Enables adapting the model sequentially.

- Employs intermediate knowledge distillation between current and immediate previous task models while training. Distills attention-level information to enable knowledge transfer and constrain distribution shifts, mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

- Uses experience replay - stores a subset of past tasks' data in memory which is replayed while learning new tasks to prevent forgetting.

Contributions:
- A scalable transformer architecture for multimodal continual learning using task attention for dynamic expansion.

- An algorithm to handle diverse, sequential vision-and-language tasks like VQA, visual reasoning etc. sharing a single model.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in terms of accuracy and catastrophic forgetting. Enables an autonomously learning agent to handle such tasks.

- Opens up possibilities for exploring continual learning in multimodal settings leveraging unified transformer architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a transformer-based continual learning framework for multimodal tasks that uses dynamic model expansion through task-specific attention layers, knowledge distillation, and experience replay to enable learning new vision-and-language tasks sequentially while mitigating catastrophic forgetting of past tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel continual learning algorithm called Task Attentive Multimodal Continual Learning (TAM-CL) for learning vision-and-language (VaL) tasks using transformer models. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A dynamically expanding, efficient transformer architecture for multimodal continual learning based on task attention layers that make the model task attentive. 

2) A training algorithm involving knowledge distillation and experience replay to enable learning of diverse, sequentially arriving VaL tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

3) Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TAM-CL method compared to existing continual learning baselines in terms of accuracy and forgetting rates.

In summary, the paper introduces a new continual learning approach tailored for multimodal transformer models to tackle vision-and-language tasks arriving sequentially, while enabling positive knowledge transfer across tasks and alleviating the problem of catastrophic forgetting. The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
