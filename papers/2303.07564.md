# [Unsupervised Cumulative Domain Adaptation for Foggy Scene Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to estimate optical flow accurately under real foggy scenes. The key hypotheses are:

1. Depth is a key factor that influences optical flow under foggy scenes. The deeper the depth, the more degraded the optical flow.

2. The correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Aligning them can help transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy domain to real foggy domain. 

Based on these hypotheses, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework with two stages:

1. Depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) which uses depth information to synthesize foggy images and transfer motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domain. 

2. Correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA) which aligns the correlation distributions of synthetic and real foggy images to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy to real foggy domain.

So in summary, the central research question is accurate optical flow estimation in real fog, addressed via a cumulative domain adaptation approach leveraging depth and cost volume correlation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes. The framework consists of two key modules - depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) and correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA). 

2. It discovers that depth is a key factor that influences optical flow performance under foggy scenes. Deeper depth leads to poorer optical flow. Based on this observation, DAMA is proposed to bridge the clean-to-foggy domain gap by associating depth with optical flow via geometry projection and synthesizing foggy images with a depth-based atmospheric scattering model.

3. It finds that the correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Based on this, CAMA is proposed to bridge the synthetic-to-real domain gap by aligning the correlation distributions to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic to real foggy domains.

4. The proposed cumulative adaptation framework progressively transfers motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy and then to real foggy domains through DAMA and CAMA. Experiments validate its effectiveness for optical flow estimation on various synthetic and real foggy datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the unsupervised cumulative adaptation approach and the findings that depth association and correlation alignment help tackle the clean-to-foggy and synthetic-to-real domain gaps respectively for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of optical flow estimation under foggy conditions:

- This paper proposes a novel approach for optical flow estimation specifically for real foggy scenes, which is an important and challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed before. Most prior work focused on synthetic foggy datasets and neglected the gap between synthetic and real foggy data.

- The key novelty is the proposed unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework with two stages - depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) and correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA). This allows a progressive transfer of motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy and finally real foggy scenes. 

- Using depth as an intermediate representation to bridge the clean-foggy gap is insightful, as depth is strongly related to fog through the atmospheric scattering model. Aligning cost volume correlations to adapt from synthetic to real fog is also clever.

- Compared to previous domain adaptation approaches for adverse weather optical flow, this paper introduces an intermediate synthetic domain and adapts in two stages. This more holistic adaptation seems more suitable for the complex foggy degradation.

- The extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art optical flow methods. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations show noticeable gains.

- A limitation is the performance degradation for distant moving objects under heavy fog. Future work could incorporate other modalities like lidar to handle this case.

Overall, this paper makes significant advances over prior art by introducing an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation approach tailored for real foggy scenes. The ideas of utilizing depth and cost volume correlation are innovative. The comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of this approach, making it an important contribution in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improve performance on distant moving objects under foggy scenes. The authors note limitations in handling distant objects due to inaccuracies in estimated depth from the stereo strategy used. They suggest trying to incorporate lidar data to help detect and handle distant moving objects.

- Explore other potential intermediate domains for domain adaptation. The authors used synthetic foggy images as an intermediate domain between clean and real foggy images. They suggest exploring other potential intermediate domains that could help bridge the gap between source and target domains. 

- Apply the approach to other adverse weather conditions beyond fog. The authors developed their method for foggy scenes specifically, but suggest it could be extended and adapted to handle other weather conditions like rain and snow.

- Investigate other potential depth-associated losses. The depth association with geometry projection played an important role in their method. They suggest exploring other potential depth-related losses that could further help with domain adaptation.

- Study adaptive fusion strategies for combining depth and image cues. The authors use a simple weighted fusion currently. They suggest studying more adaptive ways to fuse depth and image information.

- Extend to other vision tasks beyond optical flow. The authors focused on optical flow estimation, but suggest the domain adaptation approach could be applied to other vision tasks as well.

In summary, the main future directions are: improving performance on distant objects, exploring other intermediate domains, extending to other weather conditions, investigating other depth losses, adaptive fusion strategies, and extension to other vision tasks. The core ideas of cumulative adaptation and using depth association seem promising for further research.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework for estimating optical flow under real foggy scenes. The authors observe that fog degrades optical flow estimation, especially for distant objects, due to the violation of brightness and gradient constancy assumptions. To address this, they propose a two-stage adaptation process. First, a depth-association motion adaptation module bridges the gap between clean and synthetic foggy domains. It uses estimated depth maps to synthesize foggy images and enforce geometric constraints between depth and flow. Second, a correlation-alignment motion adaptation module aligns the correlation distributions of synthetic and real foggy images. This helps transfer motion knowledge from synthetic to real foggy domains. The complete framework allows progressive transfer of motion cues from clean to real foggy scenes.

The authors validate their approach on synthetic foggy KITTI and three real foggy datasets. Comparisons to state-of-the-art optical flow and domain adaptation methods demonstrate superior performance. The ablation studies analyze the contribution of each component. Limitations include inaccuracy in distant regions. Key innovations include using depth as an intermediate representation to connect clean and foggy domains and distribution alignment in correlation space to link synthetic and real foggy images. The work provides useful insights and techniques for unsupervised adaptation across different weather conditions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes. The key ideas are:

1. They discover that foggy scene optical flow deteriorates with depth, which motivates them to design a depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) module to bridge the clean-to-foggy domain gap. Specifically, they first estimate optical flow, ego-motion and depth from clean stereo images. Then they synthesize corresponding foggy images using the estimated depth and atmospheric scattering model. Finally, they enforce flow consistency between the clean and synthetic foggy domains to transfer motion knowledge. 

2. They observe that the cost volume correlation shares similar distributions between synthetic and real foggy images. This inspires them to devise a correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA) module to bridge the synthetic-to-real domain gap. Specifically, they align the correlation distributions of the synthetic and real foggy cost volumes, so as to distill motion knowledge from synthetic to real foggy domain.

3. Under this unified framework, the proposed method could progressively transfer motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domain via DAMA, and further adapt synthetic foggy motion knowledge to real foggy domain via CAMA. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation approach for real foggy scene optical flow estimation.
