# [Unsupervised Cumulative Domain Adaptation for Foggy Scene Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to estimate optical flow accurately under real foggy scenes. The key hypotheses are:

1. Depth is a key factor that influences optical flow under foggy scenes. The deeper the depth, the more degraded the optical flow.

2. The correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Aligning them can help transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy domain to real foggy domain. 

Based on these hypotheses, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework with two stages:

1. Depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) which uses depth information to synthesize foggy images and transfer motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domain. 

2. Correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA) which aligns the correlation distributions of synthetic and real foggy images to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy to real foggy domain.

So in summary, the central research question is accurate optical flow estimation in real fog, addressed via a cumulative domain adaptation approach leveraging depth and cost volume correlation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes. The framework consists of two key modules - depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) and correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA). 

2. It discovers that depth is a key factor that influences optical flow performance under foggy scenes. Deeper depth leads to poorer optical flow. Based on this observation, DAMA is proposed to bridge the clean-to-foggy domain gap by associating depth with optical flow via geometry projection and synthesizing foggy images with a depth-based atmospheric scattering model.

3. It finds that the correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Based on this, CAMA is proposed to bridge the synthetic-to-real domain gap by aligning the correlation distributions to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic to real foggy domains.

4. The proposed cumulative adaptation framework progressively transfers motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy and then to real foggy domains through DAMA and CAMA. Experiments validate its effectiveness for optical flow estimation on various synthetic and real foggy datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the unsupervised cumulative adaptation approach and the findings that depth association and correlation alignment help tackle the clean-to-foggy and synthetic-to-real domain gaps respectively for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes, using depth association and correlation alignment to progressively transfer motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domains and then to real foggy domains.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of optical flow estimation under foggy conditions:

- This paper proposes a novel approach for optical flow estimation specifically for real foggy scenes, which is an important and challenging problem that has not been sufficiently addressed before. Most prior work focused on synthetic foggy datasets and neglected the gap between synthetic and real foggy data.

- The key novelty is the proposed unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework with two stages - depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) and correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA). This allows a progressive transfer of motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy and finally real foggy scenes. 

- Using depth as an intermediate representation to bridge the clean-foggy gap is insightful, as depth is strongly related to fog through the atmospheric scattering model. Aligning cost volume correlations to adapt from synthetic to real fog is also clever.

- Compared to previous domain adaptation approaches for adverse weather optical flow, this paper introduces an intermediate synthetic domain and adapts in two stages. This more holistic adaptation seems more suitable for the complex foggy degradation.

- The extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art optical flow methods. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations show noticeable gains.

- A limitation is the performance degradation for distant moving objects under heavy fog. Future work could incorporate other modalities like lidar to handle this case.

Overall, this paper makes significant advances over prior art by introducing an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation approach tailored for real foggy scenes. The ideas of utilizing depth and cost volume correlation are innovative. The comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of this approach, making it an important contribution in this field.
