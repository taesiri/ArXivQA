# [Unsupervised Cumulative Domain Adaptation for Foggy Scene Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to estimate optical flow accurately under real foggy scenes. The key hypotheses are:

1. Depth is a key factor that influences optical flow under foggy scenes. The deeper the depth, the more degraded the optical flow.

2. The correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Aligning them can help transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy domain to real foggy domain. 

Based on these hypotheses, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework with two stages:

1. Depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) which uses depth information to synthesize foggy images and transfer motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domain. 

2. Correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA) which aligns the correlation distributions of synthetic and real foggy images to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy to real foggy domain.

So in summary, the central research question is accurate optical flow estimation in real fog, addressed via a cumulative domain adaptation approach leveraging depth and cost volume correlation.
