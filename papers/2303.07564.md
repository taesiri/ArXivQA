# [Unsupervised Cumulative Domain Adaptation for Foggy Scene Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07564)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to estimate optical flow accurately under real foggy scenes. The key hypotheses are:

1. Depth is a key factor that influences optical flow under foggy scenes. The deeper the depth, the more degraded the optical flow.

2. The correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Aligning them can help transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy domain to real foggy domain. 

Based on these hypotheses, the paper proposes a novel unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework with two stages:

1. Depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) which uses depth information to synthesize foggy images and transfer motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domain. 

2. Correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA) which aligns the correlation distributions of synthetic and real foggy images to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic foggy to real foggy domain.

So in summary, the central research question is accurate optical flow estimation in real fog, addressed via a cumulative domain adaptation approach leveraging depth and cost volume correlation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation framework for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes. The framework consists of two key modules - depth-association motion adaptation (DAMA) and correlation-alignment motion adaptation (CAMA). 

2. It discovers that depth is a key factor that influences optical flow performance under foggy scenes. Deeper depth leads to poorer optical flow. Based on this observation, DAMA is proposed to bridge the clean-to-foggy domain gap by associating depth with optical flow via geometry projection and synthesizing foggy images with a depth-based atmospheric scattering model.

3. It finds that the correlation distributions in the cost volumes of synthetic and real foggy images are similar. Based on this, CAMA is proposed to bridge the synthetic-to-real domain gap by aligning the correlation distributions to transfer motion knowledge from synthetic to real foggy domains.

4. The proposed cumulative adaptation framework progressively transfers motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy and then to real foggy domains through DAMA and CAMA. Experiments validate its effectiveness for optical flow estimation on various synthetic and real foggy datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the unsupervised cumulative adaptation approach and the findings that depth association and correlation alignment help tackle the clean-to-foggy and synthetic-to-real domain gaps respectively for optical flow estimation under real foggy scenes.
