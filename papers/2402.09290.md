# [Learning Interpretable Policies in Hindsight-Observable POMDPs through   Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many real-world environments like robotics and autonomous driving are partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). In POMDPs, the agent receives high-dimensional observations like images, but the true low-dimensional state containing key semantic information is hidden.
- Typical deep reinforcement learning methods treat observations as states and learn end-to-end policies directly from observations. This lacks interpretability as the mapping from observations to actions is complex. 
- Some methods leverage the true state available during training, but have limitations - they target specific RL algorithms like DQN or actor-critic, don't fully utilize state information, or learn policies still mapping raw observations to actions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes the Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) framework that fuses supervised and reinforcement learning. 
- PSRL has two components - a state predictor network that predicts state from observations, and a policy network that maps predicted state to actions. These are composed at test time.
- During training, the state predictor is trained with supervision using true states and the policy is trained with RL, by taking predicted instead of true states as input.
- A more general framework PSRL-K also allows learning a latent representation along with predicted state for the policy. This balances interpretability and performance.

Key Contributions:
- First framework to systematically combine supervised state prediction and RL policy learning in POMDPs by leveraging state observations at training time.
- Unified approach applicable to both DQN and actor-critic RL methods. Modulating between supervised and unsupervised learning via PSRL-K.
- Policies explicitly compose state prediction and control for interpretability. Experiments show PSRL policies outperform baselines in terms of rewards and sample efficiency across many OpenAI Gym environments.
- Analysis reveals state predictions in PSRL are highly accurate unlike uninterpretable latent states learned by end-to-end methods.

In summary, the paper proposes PSRL as an effective and interpretable reinforcement learning approach for POMDPs by fusing supervised and unsupervised learning in a principled manner.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas in this paper:

The paper proposes a Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) framework that combines supervised state prediction and reinforcement learning to leverage observability of true state during training in partially observable MDPs for enhanced sample efficiency, performance, and interpretability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of the Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) framework. The key ideas of PSRL are:

1) It assumes that true state information is available during training but not at test/execution time in partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). 

2) It leverages both supervised learning to predict state from observations as well as reinforcement learning to learn a policy mapping predicted state to actions. Specifically, it trains a state predictor network $g_\phi$ using supervised loss and a state-based policy network $\tilde{\pi}_{\theta_a}$ along with $g_\phi$ using RL loss.

3) At test time, it combines $g_\phi$ and $\tilde{\pi}_{\theta_a}$ to map observations directly to actions, thereby learning interpretable policies that separate state prediction from control.

4) It proposes a generalization called PSRL-$K$ which additionally learns a latent representation, offering a spectrum between supervised state prediction and unsupervised representation learning.

5) Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PSRL over end-to-end and asymmetric actor-critic methods across various environments and RL algorithms.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the PSRL framework for leveraging state information available during training in POMDPs to learn better and more interpretable policies.

The paper introduces the PSRL framework for reinforcement learning in POMDPs. Key ideas include leveraging state information available at training time through joint supervised and RL optimization, explicitly modeling state prediction and state-based policies for interpretability while still using raw observations as input, and modulating between supervised and unsupervised objectives. The method is evaluated on DQN and actor-critic algorithms in several Gym environments, outperforming end-to-end and asymmetric baselines. The fusion of semantic and latent states for sample efficiency and interpretability seems to be a core contribution.
