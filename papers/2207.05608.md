# [Inner Monologue: Embodied Reasoning through Planning with Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05608)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can large language models (LLMs) effectively plan and act in embodied domains by incorporating different sources of textual feedback from the environment, without requiring additional training beyond the pre-trained LLM?The key hypothesis appears to be that by leveraging various types of textual feedback (such as success detection, scene descriptions, human responses, etc.) in a continuous prompt that forms an "inner monologue", LLMs can reason more effectively to accomplish complex long-horizon tasks in robotic control scenarios. The authors propose and investigate an approach called "Inner Monologue" that continually incorporates environment observations and responses into an LLM-based planning prompt. This is hypothesized to enable improved planning, replanning, and human interaction capabilities compared to prior LLM-based planning methods that do not incorporate such feedback loops.The experiments across simulated and real robot platforms for tabletop rearrangement and mobile manipulation aim to validate whether this approach of "closing the loop" with embodied language feedback significantly improves task completion and enables new interactive reasoning capabilities, without requiring additional training of the LLM.In summary, the central research question is about the value of grounded textual feedback for LLMs in embodied planning, which is studied through the "Inner Monologue" approach across various robotics domains. The key hypothesis is that this will improve planning, replanning, and human interaction abilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating an approach called "Inner Monologue" for integrating different sources of natural language feedback into the planning process of large language models (LLMs) for robotic control tasks. In particular, the key ideas are:- Leveraging LLMs as planners for robotic manipulation by decomposing high-level instructions into sequences of skills or primitive actions. This builds on prior work using LLMs for planning.- Closing the loop between the LLM planner and the environment by continually injecting textual feedback from different sources back into the LLM prompt after each action. This allows retrying, replanning, or requesting clarification.- Studying different types of feedback - success detection, scene description, human interaction - and their impact on improving performance on long-horizon robotic tasks.- Showing that the approach can work on three different experimental domains - simulated tabletop rearrangement, real tabletop, and real mobile manipulation - using different LLMs and skills.- Demonstrating that the closed-loop feedback enables the LLMs to exhibit various emergent interactive reasoning capabilities beyond what was prompted, like adapting to new instructions, proposing new goals, answering questions about scene state, etc.In summary, the key contribution is showing how different sources of textual feedback can be combined in an "inner monologue" formulation to significantly improve LLM planning and reasoning for robotic control, without any additional training of the LLM. The results highlight the versatility of leveraging pre-trained LLMs and language feedback for embodied tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a high-level analysis of how this paper compares to related work in the field of using language models for robotics:Key Advancements:- Combines language model-based planning with grounded feedback from the environment to enable replanning and handling of failures/uncertainties. This is a novel idea not explored much before. - Shows how various types of feedback (success detection, scene description, human interaction) can be incorporated into the "inner monologue" of the language model in a shared natural language prompt.- Demonstrates emergent interactive reasoning and generalization abilities with the inner monologue approach, without needing to train the language model.Relation to Prior Work:- Builds on prior work using LLMs for robotic planning like Language Models as Task Planners, but incorporates closed-loop feedback.- Related to Socratic Models which grounds language instructions in embodiment, but focuses more on planning and replanning based on environment feedback.  - Introduces different forms of feedback compared to prior works like CLIPort which use end-to-end policies without separate perception modules.- Aims to handle long-horizon tasks like hierarchical RL methods, but uses language models to decompose tasks instead of learned hierarchies.Limitations:- Still relies on pre-trained skills and perception modules, may be limited by their capabilities.- Performance constrained by current LLM reasoning abilities in complex environments.- Limited analysis on scaling up and sensitivity to different types of feedback.In summary, it proposes a novel inner monologue approach for replanning that combines the strengths of LLMs and grounded feedback, analyses various sources of feedback, and shows promising results, though limitations remain in robustness and scalability. The interplay between language, perception, and planning is still an open area for development.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion of the paper:1. They note that the performance of the low-level control policies limits the scope of tasks that the LLM planner can reason over. Improving the capabilities of the low-level policies could allow the LLM planner to tackle more complex tasks.2. They suggest exploring fully automated versions of the system by replacing human-provided scene descriptions and object recognition with learned computer vision models like image captioning and visual question answering. As these models improve, they could approach human-level accuracy in providing textual scene descriptions.3. They propose ways to improve how the system aggregates potentially inaccurate sources of feedback, such as expressing uncertainty in the text or adding modules for safety and ethics.4. They discuss investigating the emergent capabilities and behaviors demonstrated by the LLM planner more thoroughly, as well as addressing their limitations, as promising future work.In summary, the main future directions are improving the low-level policies, replacing human feedback with automated vision models, better aggregating uncertain feedback, and further analysis of the emergent LLM behaviors. Advancing these areas could enable the approach to scale up to more complex embodied tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper introduces Inner Monologue, a method for incorporating feedback into language model based planning for embodied agents. The key idea is to construct an "inner monologue" for the agent by continually injecting information from various sources, such as success detection, scene description, and human interaction, into the language prompt used by the LLM planner. This allows the agent to reason over the feedback, adapt its plans accordingly, and solve complex long-horizon tasks. The authors demonstrate Inner Monologue in three domains - simulated tabletop rearrangement, real-world tabletop rearrangement, and real-world mobile manipulation in a kitchen. The results show that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves task completion, especially in challenging scenarios with disturbances or failures. Notably, the method inherits beneficial capabilities from LLMs, such as generalization, multilingual interaction, and interactive scene understanding, without requiring additional training beyond pre-trained skills and perception models. Limitations include reliance on accurate feedback and control modules. Overall, the work provides interesting insights into how language facilitates planning, adaptation, and human collaboration for embodied agents.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Inner Monologue, an approach that incorporates different sources of textual feedback into the planning process of large language models for embodied robot control tasks. The key idea is to create a continual "inner monologue" for the agent by injecting information from various feedback sources, such as success detectors, scene descriptors, and human interaction, into the language prompts used by large language model planners like GPT-3. The authors demonstrate Inner Monologue in three different robot manipulation domains: simulated tabletop rearrangement, real-world tabletop rearrangement, and real-world mobile manipulation in a kitchen. Across these domains, they show that closed-loop textual feedback significantly improves the agent's ability to accomplish complex long-horizon instructions, especially in scenarios with disturbances or stochastic failures. The additional feedback enables the agent to effectively retry, replan, or request human clarification when needed, leading to more robust performance. Furthermore, the authors analyse emergent reasoning capabilities enabled by the inner monologue, like continued adaptation to new instructions, interactive scene understanding, and multilingual interaction. Overall, the work provides interesting insights into how language-based feedback can be leveraged by large language models for more effective embodied reasoning and planning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents \algname, a method for improving the planning and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in embodied robotics tasks by leveraging closed-loop feedback in natural language. The key idea is to form an "inner monologue" for the LLM by continually injecting textual observations about the environment after each action taken by the robot. This feedback can include success/failure detection, scene descriptions, object recognition, and even interactive human responses. Multiple perception models provide the different types of feedback, which is combined with pretrained robotic manipulation skills that can be invoked by the LLM.The method is evaluated on long-horizon rearrangement tasks in both simulation and the real world, as well as mobile manipulation tasks in a real kitchen. Results show that incorporating the grounded feedback significantly improves the LLM's ability to retry, replan, and request help when needed, enabling it to accomplish complex instructions. Several "emergent capabilities" like interactive scene understanding are also observed without being explicitly trained. Overall, the key contribution is demonstrating how closed-loop natural language feedback can empower LLMs to reason and plan more robustly in embodied environments.
