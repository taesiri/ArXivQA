# [Learnable PINs: Cross-Modal Embeddings for Person Identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can facial and voice biometrics be combined to learn joint embeddings that can reliably verify person identity?The key hypothesis is that by training cross-modal embeddings that map face and voice samples from the same individual close together in a shared space, the model can learn to verify if two samples (one face, one voice) belong to the same person or not. The authors propose a "Learnable PIN" approach to learn these joint embeddings in a way that is more robust and secure than relying on either face or voice alone.In summary, the main research focus is on developing cross-modal biometric embeddings capable of person identification/verification by combining the complementary strengths of face and voice biometrics. The key hypothesis is that such joint embeddings can outperform unimodal systems.
