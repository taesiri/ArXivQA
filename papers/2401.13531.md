# [QAGait: Revisit Gait Recognition from a Quality Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13531)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
As gait recognition advances from controlled lab settings to in-the-wild scenarios, it encounters two key challenges: 1) Unidentifiable low-quality silhouettes due to issues like abnormal segmentation, severe occlusion, or non-human shapes; 2) Identifiable but challenging silhouettes with quality variances due to complex backgrounds, non-standard postures, slight occlusions, etc. These issues can mislead the gait model.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a quality-oriented gait recognition framework called QAGait to address these challenges in a cost-effective manner. The key components are:

1) Unified Silhouette Quality Assessment: Applies Maximal Connect Area and Template Match strategies to remove background noise and unidentifiable silhouettes before feeding them into the model.

2) Lean-aware Data Augmentation and Alignment: Introduces strict constraints in augmentation and alignment to handle non-standard postures.  

3) Quality-aware Feature Learning: Defines a quality indicator to quantify gait sequence reliability. Proposes two quality-aware losses - Quality Adaptive Margin CE (QACE) loss and Quality Adaptive Margin Triplet (QATriplet) loss to dynamically adjust optimization based on quality.

Main Contributions:

- One of the first attempts at quality-oriented gait recognition involving unified quality assessments and quality-aware feature learning.

- Cost-effective quality assessment strategies suitable for both in-the-wild and in-lab datasets.  

- Novel quality-aware losses incorporating reliable quality indicators to mitigate impact of low/variable quality silhouettes.

- Extensive experiments showing significant performance gains, e.g. 7.3% improvement in Rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D dataset.

In summary, the paper provides a convenient way to ensure gait recognition quality and reliability in complex scenarios through quality modeling.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes QAGait, a unified quality assessment and quality-aware framework for gait recognition to address challenges from unidentifiable silhouettes and quality variances in complex scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified quality assessment and quality-aware framework called QAGait for gait recognition. Specifically:

1) It proposes a series of cost-effective quality assessment strategies including Maximal Connect Area and Template Match to eliminate background noises and unidentifiable silhouettes from gait sequences. 

2) It introduces a gait quality indicator based on partial feature norm and proposes two quality-aware loss functions - Quality Adaptive Margin CE loss (QACE) and Quality Adaptive Margin Triplet loss (QATriplet) to integrate silhouette quality into optimization within the embedding space.

3) Extensive experiments on in-the-wild and in-the-lab gait datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed quality-oriented gait recognition approach in terms of both reliability and performance. The quality assessment strategies can seamlessly integrate with existing datasets and lead to superior performance.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive quality-oriented framework encompassing unified silhouette quality assessment and quality-aware feature learning to mitigate various quality issues in gait recognition especially when moving from controlled lab settings to complex in-the-wild scenarios.
