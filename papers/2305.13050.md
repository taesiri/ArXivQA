# [AudioToken: Adaptation of Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models for   Audio-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we adapt text-conditioned diffusion models to generate high-quality images conditioned on audio recordings instead of just text?The key hypothesis is that by learning an "audio token" that encodes audio features into the text latent space, they can leverage powerful pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for audio-to-image generation with minimal additional training.In summary, the paper proposes a method called AudioToken to enable text-conditioned diffusion models to generate images from audio by learning an adaptation layer between the audio and text representations.
