# [AudioToken: Adaptation of Text-Conditioned Diffusion Models for   Audio-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we adapt text-conditioned diffusion models to generate high-quality images conditioned on audio recordings instead of just text?The key hypothesis is that by learning an "audio token" that encodes audio features into the text latent space, they can leverage powerful pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for audio-to-image generation with minimal additional training.In summary, the paper proposes a method called AudioToken to enable text-conditioned diffusion models to generate images from audio by learning an adaptation layer between the audio and text representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called AudioToken for adapting text-conditioned diffusion models to generate images conditioned on audio instead of text. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using a pre-trained audio encoder to encode an input audio clip into a latent representation. - Learning an "audio token" embedding that maps this audio representation into the latent space of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This allows using the audio as a conditioning input to the model.- Only the parameters of the "audio token" embedding are trained, while the pre-trained audio encoder and text-to-image model remain fixed. This makes the approach lightweight.- Evaluating the method using both objective metrics and human evaluation, showing it outperforms baselines in generating images relevant to the input audio.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and demonstrating an effective way to adapt powerful pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to the task of audio-conditioned image generation through learning an audio token embedding. The approach is model-agnostic and lightweight.
