# [The Efficiency Spectrum of Large Language Models: An Algorithmic Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00678)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This comprehensive survey provides a holistic overview of the latest advancements in improving the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). It covers the full pipeline, examining innovations in scaling laws for resource allocation, data utilization strategies, specialized architectures, scalable training and tuning techniques, and inference acceleration methods. Key topics explored include budget efficiency via predictive scaling laws that optimize model performance under constraints; enhancing data efficiency through filtering, undersampling, active learning, and curriculum learning; architectural advancements via efficient attentions, positional encodings, sparse modeling, and even attention-free networks; distributed training techniques for memory, computation, and communication efficiency; prompt engineering and parameter-efficient tuning for versatile deployment; and inference acceleration through pruning, knowledge distillation, quantization and low-rank decomposition. This multi-faceted analysis of efficiency considerations serves as an invaluable guide for researchers looking to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities while overcoming the inherent challenges posed by their scale. It paints a comprehensive picture of this rapidly evolving landscape, setting the stage for future innovations aimed at developing more efficient yet powerful LLMs.
