# [A Good Student is Cooperative and Reliable: CNN-Transformer   Collaborative Learning for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12574)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 From my understanding, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:

How to collaboratively learn compact yet effective CNN-based and ViT-based models for semantic segmentation by selecting and exchanging reliable knowledge between them? 

Specifically, the authors propose a novel online knowledge distillation framework that enables a CNN-based student model and a ViT-based student model to teach each other and learn collaboratively. The key research questions/goals are:

1) How to enable the CNN student and ViT student to learn complementary heterogeneous features from each other, to compensate for their individual limitations? 

2) How to transfer reliable knowledge between the CNN and ViT students selectively in both the feature space and prediction space?

3) How to simultaneously optimize compact yet effective CNN and ViT models that surpass training them individually, through collaborative online distillation?

The main hypothesis is that by exchanging knowledge bidirectionally between CNN and ViT students in a selective manner guided by ground truth labels, the two heterogeneous models can learn collaboratively and achieve improved performance over training individually. The proposed methods of heterogeneous feature distillation and bidirectional selective distillation are designed to address these challenges. Experiments on semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative learning framework.

In summary, the key research question is how to synergistically optimize and transfer knowledge between CNNs and ViTs for semantic segmentation in an online distillation manner, which is addressed through the proposed techniques in this paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes the first online knowledge distillation (KD) strategy to collaboratively learn compact yet effective CNN-based and ViT-based models for semantic segmentation. 

2. It introduces two key technical innovations:

- Heterogeneous feature distillation (HFD) to improve students' consistency in low-layer feature space by mimicking heterogeneous features between CNNs and ViT.

- Bidirectional selective distillation (BSD) to transfer selective knowledge bidirectionally between CNNs and ViT in both feature space and logit space. This includes region-wise BSD to determine knowledge transfer directions between regions, and pixel-wise BSD to discern which prediction knowledge to transfer.

3. Extensive experiments show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art online distillation methods by a large margin on semantic segmentation benchmarks like PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes and CamVid. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed collaborative learning between CNN-based and ViT-based models.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first online knowledge distillation strategy to enable effective collaborative learning between CNN-based and ViT-based models for semantic segmentation, with two novel techniques HFD and BSD. Experiments validate its superiority over existing approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an online knowledge distillation framework that enables compact CNN-based and ViT-based models to collaboratively learn from each other for semantic segmentation by exchanging reliable knowledge bidirectionally between them in the feature and logit spaces.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel online knowledge distillation framework for collaboratively learning compact CNN-based and ViT-based models for semantic segmentation. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- Most prior segmentation knowledge distillation methods focus on transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model to a compact student model of the same architecture. This paper explores online distillation without a separate pre-trained teacher, between heterogeneous CNN and ViT models.

- Existing online knowledge distillation methods like DML and KDCL enable student models to teach each other based on their predictions. However, they are designed for classification and mainly transfer knowledge in the logit space. This paper tailors the distillation for segmentation by exchanging knowledge bidirectionally in both feature and logit spaces.

- Recent works have started exploring CNN-ViT hybrid models, but this paper distills knowledge directly between standalone CNN and ViT models. It makes use of their complementary strengths via techniques like heterogeneous feature distillation.

- The proposed bidirectional selective distillation dynamically determines which regions and pixels contain more reliable knowledge and transfers that knowledge between the CNN and ViT students. This provides customized guidance tailored to each student's weaknesses.

- Experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art distillation methods on semantic segmentation benchmarks. For example, a 2.72% mIoU improvement on PASCAL VOC 2012, demonstrating the benefits of collaborative CNN-ViT learning.

In summary, this paper pioneers online knowledge distillation for CNN-ViT collaborative learning in segmentation. The heterogeneous feature and bidirectional selective distillation are novel techniques tailored for this setting. The gains over prior arts highlight the value of distilling complementary knowledge between different model architectures.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring the online KD between heterogeneous ViT-based and CNN-based models with more distinct learning capacities. The current method shows somewhat limited performance gains for the higher capacity model when there is a large gap between the two models. The authors suggest further exploring methods to better improve the higher capacity model using knowledge from the lower capacity model in an online KD setting.

- Extending the proposed collaborative learning approach to other vision tasks beyond semantic segmentation, such as depth estimation, object detection, etc. The authors propose the collaborative learning framework could be promising for these other dense prediction tasks.

- Applying the collaborative learning approach across different vision tasks, such as between depth estimation and semantic segmentation models. The authors suggest it could be interesting to explore cross-task knowledge transfer and collaboration.

- Evaluating the method on larger-scale datasets. The current experiments are on relatively small datasets. Scaling up the evaluation could provide further insight into the strengths and limitations of the approach.

- Exploring other potential student model pairings, such as CNN-transformer hybrids paired with pure CNNs or transformers. The authors show some initial experiments on hybrids but suggest more exploration could be done.

- Investigating more automated and dynamic selection of where to transfer knowledge rather than pre-defined layer selections. The current HFD module uses fixed selections that may not generalize across diverse tasks.

So in summary, the main directions are around exploring the approach on more diverse models and tasks, with larger datasets, and aiming to make the collaboration more automated and dynamic. The authors lay out a promising research agenda building on their proposed method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework for online knowledge distillation to collaboratively learn compact yet effective CNN and vision transformer (ViT) models for semantic segmentation. The key ideas are: 1) A heterogeneous feature distillation module aligns features between CNN and ViT students in low layers to facilitate learning complementary representations. 2) A bidirectional selective distillation module transfers reliable knowledge between CNN and ViT students in both feature and prediction spaces - region-wise distillation determines knowledge transfer directions for different spatial regions based on prediction-GT similarity, while pixel-wise distillation selectively transfers prediction knowledge from more to less accurate pixels. Experiments on PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes and CamVid datasets show the proposed approach achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art online distillation methods by effectively enabling students to learn from each other. The compact CNN and ViT students learned simultaneously also outperform individually trained models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel online knowledge distillation framework to collaboratively learn compact yet effective CNN-based and ViT-based models for semantic segmentation. The key innovation is enabling heterogeneous students (CNN and ViT models) to teach each other by exchanging reliable knowledge bidirectionally. Specifically, the proposed method has two main technical contributions:

First, a heterogeneous feature distillation module aligns the features between CNN and ViT students in the early layers. This allows the CNN student to learn global representations from ViT and the ViT student to learn local features from CNN, compensating for each model's limitations. Second, a bidirectional selective distillation module transfers reliable knowledge at the regional and pixel levels between the students. It determines which student has more accurate predictions for each region and pixel based on ground truth, and transfers knowledge from the more reliable student to the less reliable one. Experiments on semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art online distillation methods. The proposed collaborative learning of heterogeneous models advances model compression and effectively combines the advantages of CNNs and ViTs.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel distillation paradigm for collaborative learning between CNN and ViT students. The key ideas are heterogeneous feature alignment and selective bidirectional knowledge transfer to enable ViT and CNN models to teach other their strengths. This improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining compact student models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes an online knowledge distillation framework to collaboratively learn compact yet effective CNN-based and ViT-based models for semantic segmentation. The key technical contributions are heterogeneous feature distillation (HFD) and bidirectional selective distillation (BSD). HFD aligns the features between CNN and ViT students in the low-layer feature space to make them learn complementary representations. BSD selectively transfers reliable region-wise and pixel-wise knowledge between the CNN and ViT students based on their prediction consistency. This is achieved by dynamically determining the directions of knowledge transfer between regions in the feature space and discerning which prediction knowledge should be transferred in the logit space. The overall framework enables the heterogeneous CNN and ViT models to learn from each other's strengths and compensate for individual limitations. Experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.
