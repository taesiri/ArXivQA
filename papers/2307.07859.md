# [Unified Adversarial Patch for Cross-modal Attacks in the Physical World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07859)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is: 

How to design a unified adversarial patch that can simultaneously attack visible and infrared object detectors in the physical world?

The key points are:

- Existing physical attacks are limited to single modalities (either visible or infrared), but cannot attack both modalities simultaneously. 

- The authors propose using adversarial patches and optimizing their shapes to enable cross-modal physical attacks. Shape is a universal attribute that can be captured by both visible and infrared sensors when changed.

- Two main challenges are: 1) designing a flexible yet smooth shape optimization method; 2) balancing the attack success rates between the visible and infrared detectors during optimization.

- To address these, the authors propose boundary-limited shape optimization and score-aware iterative evaluation techniques.

- Experiments demonstrate successful simultaneous evasion of visible and infrared pedestrian detectors, both digitally and physically under various conditions.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by optimizing the shape of adversarial patches, it is possible to craft a unified physical attack that can fool visible and infrared detectors simultaneously. The paper aims to demonstrate this via proposed techniques and experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a unified adversarial patch to perform cross-modal physical attacks, i.e. fooling visible and infrared object detectors simultaneously in the physical world. The key contributions are:

- It is the first work to simultaneously evade visible detectors and infrared detectors in the physical world using a single adversarial patch. 

- It designs two novel techniques: boundary-limited shape optimization and score-aware iterative evaluation, to achieve compact and smooth patch shapes that balance attacks on multi-modal detectors.

- It verifies the cross-modal patches both digitally and physically for pedestrian detection under various conditions like angles, distances, postures, and scenes.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the first unified adversarial patch attack that can fool visible and infrared detectors simultaneously in the physical world. The key ideas are optimizing the patch shape as a common feature cross modalities and balancing the attacks on multi-modal detectors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach.
