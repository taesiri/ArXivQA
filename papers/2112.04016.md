# [DeepFace-EMD: Re-ranking Using Patch-wise Earth Mover's Distance   Improves Out-Of-Distribution Face Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04016)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that re-ranking face identification results using patch-wise Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) similarity can improve precision on out-of-distribution face images containing occlusions or perturbations. 

The key ideas are:

- Traditional face identification uses cosine similarity between image embeddings, which can fail on new types of test images not seen during training.

- The authors propose a 2-stage approach: first retrieve top candidates using image embeddings, then re-rank them by comparing patch-level embeddings between the query and candidates using EMD.

- EMD compares two sets of weighted features (image patches) by finding the optimal flows between them. This allows matching images based on fine-grained correspondence of facial parts like eyes, nose, etc.

- Re-ranking with EMD consistently improves precision on challenging out-of-distribution face images - those with masks, sunglasses, crops, rotations, or adversarial perturbations.

- The improvements hold across different models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace) without retraining them, demonstrating the broad usefulness of EMD for face identification.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging EMD to compare faces at a patch-level can make face identification more robust to out-of-distribution test cases where traditional methods fail. The experiments support this hypothesis across diverse scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a 2-stage hierarchical approach for face identification that first compares images at a coarse, global level using cosine distance, and then re-ranks the top candidates using a fine-grained, patch-level comparison with Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). 

2. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on improving face identification accuracy, especially for challenging out-of-distribution query images containing occlusions, cropping, or adversarial perturbations. The method is shown to improve precision consistently across three pre-trained models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace) without any finetuning.

3. Conducting thorough ablation studies to analyze different design choices such as feature weighting techniques for EMD and combining EMD with cosine similarity. Finding interesting insights such as uniform weighting and using global average pooling features being most effective for face images.

4. Comparing the approach to finetuning on augmented masked data and showing the re-ranking rivals finetuning without requiring extra training data.

5. Providing intuitive visualizations of the patch-wise similarity using "flow" images that help explain why the re-ranking improves accuracy in occluded cases.

In summary, the key novelty appears to be in effectively harnessing EMD to compare face images in a hierarchical manner at both global and local patch levels, yielding improved out-of-distribution robustness and interpretability without retraining models. The ablation studies also provide useful insights on applying EMD specifically for face identification task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new two-stage face identification method that re-ranks gallery candidates based on patch-wise similarity using Earth Mover's Distance, achieving improved precision on challenging out-of-distribution queries like masked, cropped, or adversarial faces.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this CVPR 2022 paper compares to other related work on face identification and verification:

- It proposes a new 2-stage approach to face identification that first retrieves candidate faces using a standard cosine similarity on image embeddings, and then re-ranks them using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) on patch embeddings. This hierarchical comparison of faces is novel.

- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EMD for re-ranking faces and handling occluded/out-of-distribution queries. Prior work has not explored EMD much for deep face recognition. The most related is concurrent work on using EMD for image retrieval in DIML [49]. 

- Unlike most prior work that aims to improve robustness to occlusion via finetuning or data augmentation, this paper shows accuracy gains from simply re-ranking with EMD, without any re-training.

- It provides an extensive ablation study on different patch weighting schemes for EMD in face identification. It finds uniform weighting often works best, unlike some findings in other domains [48,49].

- The paper shows consistent gains across multiple pre-trained models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace), demonstrating generality of the approach.

- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the MLFW face verification benchmark [58], when combined with existing models.

- The work focuses on face identification and verification. Most EMD image retrieval works have been on more general domains like birds, cars [48,49]. Faces have unique properties like aligned crops and saliency of local patches.

In summary, this paper presents a thorough investigation of EMD for improving deep face recognition, especially under occlusion and out-of-distribution scenarios. The hierarchical comparison and patch weighting analysis are novel contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing methods to make solving the patch-wise EMD optimization faster. The authors note that their current approach with Sinkhorn iterative optimization is slow, which limits its applicability to very large galleries. They suggest exploring ways to speed this up.

- Exploring unequal/non-uniform weighting schemes in the EMD computation. The authors used equal weights for facial patches, but note EMD can handle unequal weights which may be useful for handling occlusions.

- Training models explicitly for patch-wise correspondence tasks, rather than just using pretrained embeddings. The authors suggest models trained specifically for matching patches may yield even better patch embeddings to use in their framework.

- Testing the approach on more model architectures and datasets. The authors demonstrated results on only 3 models and a handful of datasets, so expanding to more models and testing on more diverse datasets is suggested.

- Understanding why the re-ranking doesn't improve much for in-distribution and frontal face queries. The authors found re-ranking helps substantially for occluded/OOD faces but not as much for normal queries, so further analysis into why is warranted.

- Comparing to more occlusion-handling techniques like occlusion modeling, face recovery GANs, etc. The authors compared mainly to finetuning on occluded data, but suggest more comparisons to other types of approaches.

- Exploring modifications like using EMD+cosine similarity for ranking too. The authors used EMD only for re-ranking, but suggest exploring using it in Stage 1 ranking too.

So in summary, the main suggestions are around improvements to efficiency, exploring extensions of the technique, more comprehensive evaluations, and comparisons to other state-of-the-art techniques. The core idea seems promising but there are many avenues to take it further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage method for improving face identification, particularly on out-of-distribution query images containing occlusions or perturbations. In the first stage, gallery images are ranked by their cosine similarity to the query image using the deep features from an off-the-shelf face recognition model like ArcFace. Then in the second stage, the top-k candidates are re-ranked using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between patches of the query and gallery images. This patch-level similarity is more robust to occlusions. Without any model finetuning, the method improves face identification accuracy across various models on challenging datasets with masked, sunglasses, cropped, and adversarial queries. Different feature weighting schemes for EMD are explored, with spatial correlation and average pooling correlation working best. The flow visualizations also provide intuitive explanations of the patch-wise image matching. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using patch-based EMD to improve out-of-distribution generalization for face identification.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage framework for improving face identification robustness, especially on out-of-distribution (OOD) queries with occlusions or perturbations. In stage 1, gallery images are ranked by their cosine similarity to the query image based on a pre-trained deep face recognition model like FaceNet or ArcFace. Then in stage 2, the top-k candidates are re-ranked using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the spatial patch embeddings from the deep model. EMD better captures fine-grained, patch-level similarity. The authors thoroughly evaluate different techniques for weighting the importance of patches for EMD. Without any finetuning, the proposed re-ranking approach consistently improves precision on challenging OOD queries - masked faces, cropped faces, adversarial faces - while maintaining accuracy on original in-distribution data. For example, on masked faces from MLFW, re-ranking improves precision@1 over just using cosine similarity by 4-9% across models. The method rivals finetuning on improving robustness to masks. An intuitive "flow" visualization shows the patch correspondence and reconstruction between two faces based on optimal EMD matching. Overall, the work demonstrates the power of using EMD for re-ranking based on deep spatial embeddings to substantially boost face identification under occlusion and adversarial perturbations.

In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions: 1) Proposes a novel two-stage face identification pipeline leveraging EMD re-ranking on spatial embeddings for improving robustness, especially on OOD queries; 2) Demonstrates consistent precision gains over strong baselines on challenging datasets without retraining; 3) Provides thorough evaluation and insights on weighting techniques for patch importance in EMD computation; 4) Introduces an intuitive flow visualization for interpreting patch-level face similarity. The method represents an effective way to boost existing face recognition models on perturbed queries by harnessing both global image and local patch information.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a two-stage approach for improving face identification under challenging conditions like occlusions or adversarial perturbations. The key points are:

- They use pre-trained state-of-the-art face recognition models like ArcFace, CosFace, and FaceNet to extract deep embeddings. 

- In stage 1, they rank gallery images using cosine similarity between image embeddings, which is the common approach. 

- In stage 2, they re-rank the top-k candidates from stage 1 using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) computed on spatial embeddings of image patches. This compares images in a fine-grained manner.

- They experiment with different techniques to weigh the importance of patches for EMD computation. Uniform weighting works best for face images.

- Without any re-training, their two-stage approach consistently improves precision on various out-of-distribution query types - masked faces, occlusion, rotation, adversarial images etc.

- Their patch-level similarity technique is especially effective for masked faces and random crops, giving large gains over just using image-level similarity.

- For masked faces, their no-training method rivals models fine-tuned on masked data.

In summary, they show that leveraging patch-level similarity via EMD in a two-stage framework significantly improves face identification under challenging real-world conditions, without requiring re-training.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a two-stage face identification approach called DeepFace-EMD to improve robustness to out-of-distribution queries. Traditional face identification ranks gallery images using cosine distance between feature embeddings, which performs poorly on occluded or adversarial faces. They propose first retrieving top candidates using cosine distance, then re-ranking them using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between image patches. EMD compares faces at a finer granularity to measure structural similarity. Experiments on occluded, cropped, rotated, and adversarial faces from datasets like LFW, CFP, and AgeDB show their method substantially improves precision over the baseline across models like ArcFace, CosFace and FaceNet. The key findings are that computing patch-wise similarity helps on out-of-distribution queries, and their re-ranking approach rivals finetuning models on augmented data without requiring retraining. The flow visualizations also provide intuition on how EMD matches facial patches across images. Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of EMD for robust face identification, especially on challenging out-of-distribution test cases. Their unsupervised approach can be integrated into existing systems to improve real-world performance.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a two-stage approach called DeepFace-EMD to improve the robustness of face identification systems to out-of-distribution query images such as those with occlusions or adversarial perturbations. In the first stage, a face embedding model ranks gallery images by their cosine similarity to the query image. In the second stage, the top-k candidates are re-ranked based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between patch-level embeddings of the query and gallery images. EMD accounts for fine-grained, spatial similarity of image patches and is more robust to occlusions than global image embeddings. Without finetuning feature extractors, DeepFace-EMD improves identification accuracy across ArcFace, CosFace and FaceNet models on various out-of-distribution queries including masked faces, sunglasses, crops, rotations and adversarial perturbations. It rivals finetuning on augmented data and establishes state-of-the-art verification performance on MLFW. The two-stage coarse-to-fine approach leverages global and local facial features to enhance robustness, particularly to occlusions, without architectural changes or retraining.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 2-stage approach for face identification, with the first stage ranking based on cosine similarity of image embeddings and the second stage re-ranking using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) on patch embeddings. Why is this 2-stage approach more effective than just using EMD or just using cosine similarity alone? How do the two stages complement each other?

2. The paper explores different techniques for weighting facial patches when computing EMD, such as spatial correlation, average pooling correlation, and uniform weighting. Why is adaptive, similarity-based weighting generally more effective than uniform weighting? And why does average pooling correlation perform better than cross correlation for weighting patches in face identification?

3. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EMD re-ranking on several out-of-distribution face identification tests, including masked faces, sunglasses, random crops, and adversarial examples. Why is EMD particularly suited for handling these types of occlusions and image perturbations compared to just using cosine similarity? 

4. The visualizations of the EMD flows between image patches provide an intuitive understanding of how the model is matching facial features between two face images. How could these visualizations be further analyzed to gain additional insight into the model's feature representations and similarity assessments?

5. The paper shows that the proposed approach improves performance across three different pre-trained models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace) without any fine-tuning or training. What properties of these models enable the EMD re-ranking to work well on top of them without modification?

6. How precisely does the EMD re-ranking stage help correct errors made in the initial cosine similarity ranking stage? What types of errors does it commonly correct? Are there any errors it fails to correct?

7. The paper compares the method against finetuning ArcFace on masked images, and shows competitive performance without any training. What are the tradeoffs between this approach versus finetuning on occluded data? When would one be preferred over the other?

8. The patch embeddings used for EMD are taken from late convolutional layers of the networks. How would using embeddings from different layers affect the re-ranking performance? Is there an optimal layer choice?

9. The paper focuses on face identification, but could this approach be extended to other image retrieval tasks where robustness to occlusions is important? What modifications or adjustments might be needed?

10. The accuracy improvements demonstrated are substantial but there is still room left between the re-ranking method's performance and perfect re-ranking. What factors are limiting the re-ranking accuracy and how could the approach be improved further?
