# DeepFace-EMD: Re-ranking Using Patch-wise Earth Mover's Distance   Improves Out-Of-Distribution Face Identification

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that re-ranking face identification results using patch-wise Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) similarity can improve precision on out-of-distribution face images containing occlusions or perturbations. The key ideas are:- Traditional face identification uses cosine similarity between image embeddings, which can fail on new types of test images not seen during training.- The authors propose a 2-stage approach: first retrieve top candidates using image embeddings, then re-rank them by comparing patch-level embeddings between the query and candidates using EMD.- EMD compares two sets of weighted features (image patches) by finding the optimal flows between them. This allows matching images based on fine-grained correspondence of facial parts like eyes, nose, etc.- Re-ranking with EMD consistently improves precision on challenging out-of-distribution face images - those with masks, sunglasses, crops, rotations, or adversarial perturbations.- The improvements hold across different models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace) without retraining them, demonstrating the broad usefulness of EMD for face identification.In summary, the central hypothesis is that leveraging EMD to compare faces at a patch-level can make face identification more robust to out-of-distribution test cases where traditional methods fail. The experiments support this hypothesis across diverse scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a 2-stage hierarchical approach for face identification that first compares images at a coarse, global level using cosine distance, and then re-ranks the top candidates using a fine-grained, patch-level comparison with Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). 2. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach on improving face identification accuracy, especially for challenging out-of-distribution query images containing occlusions, cropping, or adversarial perturbations. The method is shown to improve precision consistently across three pre-trained models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace) without any finetuning.3. Conducting thorough ablation studies to analyze different design choices such as feature weighting techniques for EMD and combining EMD with cosine similarity. Finding interesting insights such as uniform weighting and using global average pooling features being most effective for face images.4. Comparing the approach to finetuning on augmented masked data and showing the re-ranking rivals finetuning without requiring extra training data.5. Providing intuitive visualizations of the patch-wise similarity using "flow" images that help explain why the re-ranking improves accuracy in occluded cases.In summary, the key novelty appears to be in effectively harnessing EMD to compare face images in a hierarchical manner at both global and local patch levels, yielding improved out-of-distribution robustness and interpretability without retraining models. The ablation studies also provide useful insights on applying EMD specifically for face identification task.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key ways this CVPR 2022 paper compares to other related work on face identification and verification:- It proposes a new 2-stage approach to face identification that first retrieves candidate faces using a standard cosine similarity on image embeddings, and then re-ranks them using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) on patch embeddings. This hierarchical comparison of faces is novel.- The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EMD for re-ranking faces and handling occluded/out-of-distribution queries. Prior work has not explored EMD much for deep face recognition. The most related is concurrent work on using EMD for image retrieval in DIML [49]. - Unlike most prior work that aims to improve robustness to occlusion via finetuning or data augmentation, this paper shows accuracy gains from simply re-ranking with EMD, without any re-training.- It provides an extensive ablation study on different patch weighting schemes for EMD in face identification. It finds uniform weighting often works best, unlike some findings in other domains [48,49].- The paper shows consistent gains across multiple pre-trained models (ArcFace, FaceNet, CosFace), demonstrating generality of the approach.- The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the MLFW face verification benchmark [58], when combined with existing models.- The work focuses on face identification and verification. Most EMD image retrieval works have been on more general domains like birds, cars [48,49]. Faces have unique properties like aligned crops and saliency of local patches.In summary, this paper presents a thorough investigation of EMD for improving deep face recognition, especially under occlusion and out-of-distribution scenarios. The hierarchical comparison and patch weighting analysis are novel contributions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Developing methods to make solving the patch-wise EMD optimization faster. The authors note that their current approach with Sinkhorn iterative optimization is slow, which limits its applicability to very large galleries. They suggest exploring ways to speed this up.- Exploring unequal/non-uniform weighting schemes in the EMD computation. The authors used equal weights for facial patches, but note EMD can handle unequal weights which may be useful for handling occlusions.- Training models explicitly for patch-wise correspondence tasks, rather than just using pretrained embeddings. The authors suggest models trained specifically for matching patches may yield even better patch embeddings to use in their framework.- Testing the approach on more model architectures and datasets. The authors demonstrated results on only 3 models and a handful of datasets, so expanding to more models and testing on more diverse datasets is suggested.- Understanding why the re-ranking doesn't improve much for in-distribution and frontal face queries. The authors found re-ranking helps substantially for occluded/OOD faces but not as much for normal queries, so further analysis into why is warranted.- Comparing to more occlusion-handling techniques like occlusion modeling, face recovery GANs, etc. The authors compared mainly to finetuning on occluded data, but suggest more comparisons to other types of approaches.- Exploring modifications like using EMD+cosine similarity for ranking too. The authors used EMD only for re-ranking, but suggest exploring using it in Stage 1 ranking too.So in summary, the main suggestions are around improvements to efficiency, exploring extensions of the technique, more comprehensive evaluations, and comparisons to other state-of-the-art techniques. The core idea seems promising but there are many avenues to take it further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage method for improving face identification, particularly on out-of-distribution query images containing occlusions or perturbations. In the first stage, gallery images are ranked by their cosine similarity to the query image using the deep features from an off-the-shelf face recognition model like ArcFace. Then in the second stage, the top-k candidates are re-ranked using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between patches of the query and gallery images. This patch-level similarity is more robust to occlusions. Without any model finetuning, the method improves face identification accuracy across various models on challenging datasets with masked, sunglasses, cropped, and adversarial queries. Different feature weighting schemes for EMD are explored, with spatial correlation and average pooling correlation working best. The flow visualizations also provide intuitive explanations of the patch-wise image matching. Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of using patch-based EMD to improve out-of-distribution generalization for face identification.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage framework for improving face identification robustness, especially on out-of-distribution (OOD) queries with occlusions or perturbations. In stage 1, gallery images are ranked by their cosine similarity to the query image based on a pre-trained deep face recognition model like FaceNet or ArcFace. Then in stage 2, the top-k candidates are re-ranked using the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the spatial patch embeddings from the deep model. EMD better captures fine-grained, patch-level similarity. The authors thoroughly evaluate different techniques for weighting the importance of patches for EMD. Without any finetuning, the proposed re-ranking approach consistently improves precision on challenging OOD queries - masked faces, cropped faces, adversarial faces - while maintaining accuracy on original in-distribution data. For example, on masked faces from MLFW, re-ranking improves precision@1 over just using cosine similarity by 4-9% across models. The method rivals finetuning on improving robustness to masks. An intuitive "flow" visualization shows the patch correspondence and reconstruction between two faces based on optimal EMD matching. Overall, the work demonstrates the power of using EMD for re-ranking based on deep spatial embeddings to substantially boost face identification under occlusion and adversarial perturbations.In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions: 1) Proposes a novel two-stage face identification pipeline leveraging EMD re-ranking on spatial embeddings for improving robustness, especially on OOD queries; 2) Demonstrates consistent precision gains over strong baselines on challenging datasets without retraining; 3) Provides thorough evaluation and insights on weighting techniques for patch importance in EMD computation; 4) Introduces an intuitive flow visualization for interpreting patch-level face similarity. The method represents an effective way to boost existing face recognition models on perturbed queries by harnessing both global image and local patch information.
