# [REFRESH: Responsible and Efficient Feature Reselection Guided by SHAP   Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Feature selection in ML models is typically done to optimize accuracy. However, other model characteristics like fairness, robustness, and explainability are also important. 
- When features are selected for accuracy, models may perform poorly on secondary characteristics. Re-doing feature selection from scratch is expensive, especially for large datasets.
- Hence the paper introduces the problem of "feature reselection" - selecting alternate feature subsets to improve secondary characteristics while maintaining accuracy.

Proposed Solution - REFRESH:
- Groups features based on correlations. Uses SHAP values and their additive property to approximate model outcomes when removing a group of correlated features.
- Ranks feature groups by anticipated effect on secondary characteristic. Removes features from worst groups, adds from best groups to create alternate feature subsets.
- Constraints can be added to prevent erroneous feature removal/addition.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces and motivates the problem of feature reselection to incrementally improve model characteristics.
- Proposes a SHAP value based approximation to efficiently evaluate feature groups without retraining models.
- Presents REFRESH method using this approximation to reselect features guiding by secondary characteristics.
- Shows experiments on 3 datasets where REFRESH found alternate models with improved fairness and robustness.

The summary covers the key points on the problem definition, proposed solution REFRESH, its underlying approximation method, and experimental results showing its ability to find alternate models.
