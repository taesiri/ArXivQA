# [Seller-side Outcome Fairness in Online Marketplaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03253)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of seller-side outcome fairness in online marketplaces and proposes an optimization framework and algorithm to address it. The authors motivate the need for seller-side fairness by arguing that lack of fairness leads to issues like popularity bias, reduced seller diversity and loyalty, and suboptimal economic outcomes. To quantify and optimize for fairness, they formulate a constrained optimization problem with a fairness regularization term based on ensuring sellers meet target outcome levels. They develop a duality-based online learning algorithm leveraging stochastic gradient descent on the dual problem along with a novel exploration scheme for inaccurate reward estimates. Through extensive experiments on real e-commerce datasets, they demonstrate the efficacy of their approach in improving seller-side fairness measures like number of sellers above target clicks while not detrimentally impacting metrics like revenue. Their work provides an effective method to promote equity and diversity across sellers in online marketplaces. Key strengths are the practical business motivation, novel optimization formulation, and strong empirical validation on real data.
