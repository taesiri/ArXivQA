## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Video action recognition is an important task for video understanding with many real-world applications. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great progress on this task thanks to large-scale datasets and advances in CNN architectures. However, there are still challenges including modeling long-range temporal information, high computational cost, and incomparable results due to dataset/evaluation differences. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of over 200 papers on using deep learning for video action recognition. The authors first introduce 17 widely used datasets and their key characteristics. Then they review models chronologically, starting from early attempts to adapt CNNs, to two-stream networks using optical flow, followed by 3D CNNs with 3D kernels, and finally recent efficient models. They group methods into categories and explain representative papers in detail.  

Main Contributions:
1) Comprehensive review of 200+ papers covering different deep learning techniques for video action recognition over the past decade.
2) Benchmarking of popular methods on standard datasets in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Code is released for reproducibility.  
3) Elaboration of open challenges, problems and opportunities to facilitate future research directions, including multi-modality learning, self-supervised representation learning, neural architecture search, model compression, etc.

In summary, this paper serves as an excellent survey and tutorial for researchers to obtain a systematic overview of recent advancements in using deep learning for video action recognition, inspire new research ideas by identifying opportunities, and provide strong baselines to compare against.
