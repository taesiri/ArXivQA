# [Explainable Link Prediction for Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Contact tracing is important to control the spread of COVID-19, but adoption of contact tracing apps has been low due to privacy concerns. 
- There is a need to increase trust in contact tracing apps to encourage more people to install and actively use them.

Proposed Solution:
- Use graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict possible exposure links between individuals, instead of relying solely on recorded proximity events which can miss exposures.
- Generate explanations for predicted exposure links using improvements to Anchors and a new path ranking algorithm. Explanations aim to increase trust.  
- Introduce "Graphsheets" based on Factsheets to provide transparency into models, data and systems used for contact tracing.
- Use insights from explanations and Graphsheets to "nudge" users to share relevant personal information.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates GNNs can effectively predict exposure links on social network dataset as proof of concept
- Proposes enhancements to Anchors explanations by incorporating GNN Explainer output 
- Introduces path ranking algorithm to explain exposure links 
- Defines Graphsheets to increase trustworthiness of contact tracing apps
- Discusses use of nudging based on explainability to encourage user participation

In summary, the paper presents ideas to increase user trust and participation in contact tracing apps by explaining exposure link predictions, providing transparency through Graphsheets, and nudging users to share personal information relevant for tracing virus exposures. This aims to make these apps more effective for combating spread of COVID-19.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using graph neural networks for link prediction in privacy-preserving contact tracing applications, with ideas to build trust and encourage adoption through explainability techniques and standardized information disclosure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing ideas to encourage adoption of digital contact tracing apps by improving trust through explanations and graphsheets, while still preserving privacy. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes using graph neural networks for link prediction to predict possible exposure events, rather than just relying on recorded proximity events. This aims to reduce false negatives.

2) To explain the predicted exposure links, the paper explores improvements to Anchors explanations by incorporating GNN Explainer output. It also proposes a new path ranking based explanation method.

3) The paper introduces the idea of graphsheets, inspired by factsheets, to provide standardized information about the graphs, models, and practices used to increase trustworthiness and transparency.

4) Finally, the paper discusses how explanations and graphsheets can be used to "nudge" users to share relevant personal information, while avoiding privacy risks from sharing unnecessary data. The goal is to balance privacy preservation with encouraging sharing of information for public health benefits.

In summary, the main contribution is using ideas from explainability, transparency, and behavioral science to increase adoption and information sharing on digital contact tracing applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using graph neural networks for link prediction to identify possible exposure events in contact tracing. What are some of the challenges in framing this as a link prediction problem compared to traditional applications of link prediction?

2. The paper argues that explaining the predictions of graph neural networks could increase adoption of contact tracing apps. What are some ways the explanations could be made more intuitive and human-understandable? 

3. The Graph Anchors method is proposed to improve explanations by using the output of GNN Explainer. What are some limitations of this approach and how can it be improved further?

4. The path ranking algorithm is an alternative approach proposed for explaining links. What are some ways this could complement or be integrated with the Graph Anchors method?

5. Graphsheets are introduced to increase trust and transparency in contact tracing models. What kind of information could be included beyond what is shown in Figure 5 to make them more useful? 

6. The idea of nudging is proposed to encourage sharing of information. What are some ethical considerations in nudging for public health applications that need to be kept in mind?

7. What additional constraints need to be considered in selecting negative samples for link prediction in contact tracing graphs compared to other domains?

8. How can the ideas proposed be extended for entity resolution which is needed in physical contact tracing? What components would differ?

9. What validations need to be done on the GNN models and explanations before deploying such a system at scale for sensitive applications like contact tracing? 

10. The paper focuses on encouraging app installs and information sharing. What other behavioral barriers need to be addressed to make contact tracing effective?
