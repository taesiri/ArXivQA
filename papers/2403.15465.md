# [Most Likely Sequence Generation for $n$-Grams, Transformers, HMMs, and   Markov Chains, by Using Rollout Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15465)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the problem of generating likely sequences of words (text) using an n-gram model underlying systems like ChatGPT. 
- Finding the single most likely sequence is intractable due to the exponentially large search space. 
- The greedy policy that selects the most probable next word performs poorly in practice.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using rollout algorithms from approximate dynamic programming to find highly likely word sequences. 
- Rollout uses a base policy (greedy here) to evaluate future decisions, balancing local and global preferences.
- One-step rollout finds the next word that maximizes the probability of the greedy sequence starting from that word.
- Multistep rollout looks ahead multiple words to evaluate decisions.  

Contributions:
- Provides rollout algorithms for sequence generation in n-gram models and transformers.
- Shows one-step rollout provably improves on greedy for any Markov chain.
- Demonstrates substantial gains over greedy in practice, approaching optimal sequences.  
- Considers computational enhancements like simplified, truncated, and double rollout.
- Validates performance on small explicit Markov chains and a fine-tuned GPT model.
- Discusses connections to Viterbi decoding for Hidden Markov Model inference.
- Overall, develops a practical and scalable method to generate higher quality text from language models.

In summary, the paper develops rollout algorithms for sequence generation that significantly improve on greedy selection in n-gram models and transformers like ChatGPT, with analysis and experimental validation.
