# [WannaLaugh: A Configurable Ransomware Emulator -- Learning to Mimic   Malicious Storage Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07540)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Ransomware is a severe and rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat that encrypts files and demands ransom payment. Traditional detection methods relying on static signatures struggle to adapt.
- Developing new detection techniques requires safely generating realistic ransomware traces, without exposing systems to actual threats. This is challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop "WannaLaugh", a highly configurable, open-source ransomware emulator to safely mimic ransomware encryption behavior and generate traces.

Key Contributions:
1. WannaLaugh ransomware emulator:
- Safely emulates encryption behavior of ransomware without causing harm or spreading malware.
- Flexible configuration covers encryption algorithms, methods, content, delays, etc. to mimic known and potential future ransomware strains.
- Includes encryptor, decryptor and server for ransom negotiations.

2. Demonstrate emulator's use for ML model training:
- Use emulator to generate ransomware traces along with real ransomware traces. 
- Extract features like entropy, throughput, LBA variance over time windows.
- Train ML models (Random Forests, XGBoost, DNNs) to detect ransomware.

3. Algorithm to select emulator parameters:
- Explore large configuration space to find parameters that mimic known strains or form new potential strains. 
- Compare optimization algorithms like random walk, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms.
- Show NSGA-II converges fastest to mimic or not mimic strains.

Key outcomes:
- Tool to safely and realistically generate ransomware traces for developing new detection models.
- Approach to configure emulator to mimic existing or form new ransomware strains.
- Highlight path for enhancing emulator and ransomware detection research.
