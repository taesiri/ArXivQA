# [UDE-based Dynamic Motion Force Control of Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00443)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Mobile manipulators, consisting of a robotic manipulator mounted on a mobile base, have promising applications but controlling them is challenging due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and base.
- Existing control methods rely on complex whole-body dynamics modeling which is difficult and has poor transferability across platforms. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel dynamic model of the manipulator on the mobile base by incorporating only the manipulator dynamics and mobile base kinematic information. This simplifies modeling and improves transferability.

- Based on this model, an Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) based control scheme is proposed to compensate for dynamic coupling and unmodeled uncertainties. It uses feedforward terms to predict coupling effects and UDE to estimate uncertainties.

Main Contributions:
- Novel simplified dynamic model of the manipulator on a moving base using just manipulator dynamics and base kinematics

- UDE-based dynamic motion/force controller design incorporating the proposed model along with feedback and feedforward terms

- Theoretical stability analysis proving asymptotic stability

- Comparative simulations and experiments validating:
   - Accuracy of proposed dynamic model  
   - Superior motion/force tracking of proposed controller
   - Robustness against base movement disturbances

In summary, the key innovation is the simplified modeling approach and UDE-based control scheme for mobile manipulators. This demonstrates better performance while being easy to implement across platforms. Evaluations confirm the ability to compensate for base movement effects.
