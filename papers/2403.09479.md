# [Laying the Foundation First? Investigating the Generalization from   Atomic Skills to Complex Reasoning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09479)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current math word problem (MWP) datasets like GSM8K lack comprehensive coverage of atomic skills (e.g. arithmetic, unit conversion) needed to solve complex reasoning tasks. They are limited in the difficulty level and variety of atomic skill application.

- Existing large language models (LMs) also have deficiencies in acquiring robust atomic skills just from solving complex reasoning tasks. Their performance is not comprehensively evaluated.

Solution:
- Construct specialized datasets to systematically cover atomic skills in arithmetic and unit conversion across different difficulty criteria like number of calculation steps, value types, etc.

- Generate compositional datasets integrating the atomic skills. Also augment GSM8K with more difficult arithmetic problems.

- Propose a new continual learning strategy - Hierarchical Continual Learning (HCL) - to first train the LM on atomic skills and then fine-tune on GSM8K while retaining some atomic skill examples.

Contributions:  
- Specialized prerequisite datasets for comprehensive atomic skill training and testing.

- Rigorous benchmarks and protocols to evaluate acquisition of skills. 

- Novel HCL strategy that gives consistent and significantly better performance than baseline LMs on both atomic and complex reasoning tasks.

- In-depth analysis providing insights like: atomic skill level strongly correlates with reasoning ability; hierarchical training helps avoid catastrophic forgetting.

The paper makes notable contributions in constructing specialized resources and benchmarks for atomic skills underlying math word problems, and devising an effective hierarchical continual learning approach to train language models that demonstrably enhances their reasoning skills.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the construction and augmentation of prerequisite skill data for arithmetic and unit conversion to improve language models' reasoning abilities on math word problems through continual learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content provided, the main contribution of this paper seems to be:

1) The development of a rule-based approach to systematically construct training data for assessing and enhancing two key atomic skills - arithmetic and unit conversion - in language models. This includes algorithms to generate data across varying levels of difficulty.

2) The augmentation of existing math word problem evaluation datasets (GSM8K) to create more comprehensive test sets that better assess model competence on those atomic skills. This is done by expanding the significant digit lengths for arithmetic and variety of unit representations for unit conversion. 

3) Demonstrating that directly training language models on the constructed prerequisite tasks leads to improved performance on those atomic skills. It also shows that this skill enhancement correlates with better performance on composite, downstream math word problems.

4) Analysis showing that while composite tasks can improve atomic skills, training explicitly on prerequisite tasks is more effective. The paper also examines issues like catastrophic forgetting and the need for consistent atomic skill distributions between prerequisite and composite data.

In summary, the key contribution is a methodology and data for assessing and enhancing key skills in language models to improve performance on complex, compositional math word problems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions constructing arithmetic prerequisite data using a rule-based approach. What are some of the key rules and considerations when generating the data? How do factors like number of hops, digit length, value type etc. impact the difficulty level?

2. For unit conversion prerequisite tasks, what was the motivation behind using the DimUnitKB ontology? What are some benefits of leveraging this structured knowledge source? 

3. When creating the compositional data, what were some key challenges faced in extracting and replacing segments related to atomic skills? How did the authors ensure seamlessness when swapping out parts of the response?

4. The paper argues GSM8K dataset does not comprehensively cover application of skills. What are some limitations around arithmetic and unit conversion? How exactly was the test data augmented to address this?

5. Could you elaborate more on the human evaluation process for error analysis? What were the major error categories? What insights were gained from manual assessment? 

6. The paper mentions balanced mixing ratios vary for different skills - why does arithmetic require more prerequisite data than unit conversion in skill training? What implications does this have?

7. What correlation was observed between performance on prerequisite tasks vs compositional tasks? What does this suggest regarding the relationship between atomic skills and reasoning ability?

8. For the anomaly in simple multiplication, what exactly caused the incorrect magnitude responses? Why didn't compositional data properly cover this arithmetic operation?

9. Could you expound more on the conditional property of avoiding catastrophic forgetting? Why must distributions match between stages?

10. What are some ideas to further enhance the continuity of knowledge transfer when transitioning from atomic to compositional skills?
