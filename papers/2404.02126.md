# [Rematch: Robust and Efficient Matching of Local Knowledge Graphs to   Improve Structural and Semantic Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02126)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge graphs like Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs) are useful for language understanding tasks but evaluating their quality requires accurately measuring similarity between AMR graphs.
- Existing AMR similarity metrics have limitations in efficiency, ability to capture semantic similarity to source text, and lack of a systematic benchmark to evaluate structural similarity.

Proposed Solution - Rematch:
- Introduces a new AMR similarity metric called Rematch that uses "motifs" - unordered semantic features based on AMR instances, attributes and relations - to capture semantic similarity.
- Motifs provide a more efficient way to match AMRs compared to prior node-alignment based techniques.
- Proposes a new dataset called RARE (Randomized AMRs with Rewired Edges) to evaluate structural similarity of AMR metrics.

Contributions:
- Rematch outperforms prior AMR metrics in semantic similarity on STS-B and SICK-R benchmarks while also being 5x faster.
- Rematch ranks second on structural similarity on the introduced RARE benchmark.
- The RARE dataset provides the first systematic evaluation for structural sensitivity of AMR metrics.
- Analysis shows Rematch handles negation better but can sometimes underestimate similarity due to its nested motif structure.
- The efficiency and semantic matching ability of Rematch highlights the rich semantics encoded within AMRs.

In summary, the paper introduces a new efficient AMR similarity metric Rematch that outperforms prior methods in semantic textual similarity while also evaluating structural sensitivity using a novel RARE benchmark. The results demonstrate AMRs encode richer semantics than previously assumed.
