# [A Surprising Failure? Multimodal LLMs and the NLVR Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates three state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) - GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and IDEFICS - on the Natural Language Visual Reasoning (NLVR) task. NLVR requires determining if a human-written sentence is true or false with respect to a synthetic image containing simple geometric shapes. The goal of NLVR is to assess models' ability to demonstrate compositional and spatial reasoning skills.

The models are evaluated in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot, the best performing prompt is selected for each model from a set of candidate prompts. For few-shot, the prompts are conditioned on 5 training examples before evaluating on the test set. The models are compared to human performance and previous state-of-the-art on NLVR.

The key results are:
- All models perform significantly worse than human performance and previous SOTA: The best accuracy is 59.9% by GPT-4V with zero-shot prompting, compared to 95.4% for humans and 78.3% for previous SOTA.
- Few-shot prompting hurts performance for GPT-4V and IDEFICS but helps Gemini Pro. 
- Fine-tuning helps IDEFICS, achieving 59.7% accuracy, but still far below human performance.
- The models are biased in their predictions, skewed towards True or False.

The key conclusion is that despite the strong performance of MLLMs on several vision-language tasks, they still struggle with the fundamental compositional and spatial reasoning skills tested by NLVR. There remains significant room for improvement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper evaluates three multimodal large language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and IDEFICS) on the natural language visual reasoning task NLVR and finds that despite their strong performance on other tasks, they still struggle with the fundamental compositional and spatial reasoning challenges that NLVR presents.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

Evaluating three state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and IDEFICS) on the NLVR dataset, which requires compositional and spatial reasoning. The key finding is that despite the strong performance of these models on other tasks, they still perform poorly on NLVR. This suggests that the fundamental challenges NLVR presents in terms of spatial and compositional reasoning remain unsolved even for cutting-edge multimodal LLMs. The paper helps benchmark where these models currently stand on this type of reasoning and highlights that there is still significant room for improvement.

In summary, the main contribution is benchmarking leading MLLMs on the compositional reasoning task NLVR and showing there are still major gaps in their capabilities on this type of task.

The paper evaluates three recent MLLMs (GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, IDEFICS) on the NLVR task, which requires compositional and spatial reasoning about a sentence and corresponding image. It examines the models' performance using different prompting strategies as well as fine-tuning. The key focus areas are multimodal reasoning, specifically for vision and language, and understanding the capabilities and limitations of modern MLLMs on tasks requiring deeper semantic understanding beyond surface pattern recognition.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What was the motivation behind evaluating multimodal LLMs on the NLVR task? Why was NLVR specifically chosen to probe these models' compositional reasoning abilities?

2. The paper experiments with both zero-shot and few-shot prompting approaches. What are the tradeoffs between these two techniques? Under what conditions might one be preferred over the other? 

3. The prompts used for each model differ. How might the prompt engineering process impact the final results and conclusions drawn? How can prompt engineering be standardized to enable better comparisons?

4. For the few-shot prompting approach, examples are randomly sampled from the training set. Why might this be suboptimal? How could more targeted few-shot example selection potentially improve performance?

5. The paper finds that fine-tuning helps for IDEFICS but degrades performance for the other models. What factors might explain this discrepancy in transfer learning ability between models?

6. All models perform better on the Tower images compared to Scatter. Why might this be the case? What specific challenges do the Scatter images pose?

7. The paper does not have access to the training data for proprietary models like GPT-4V and Gemini. How does this impact analysis of factors like data leakage? What additional experiments could be run if the training data was accessible?

8. How do the models compare in their tendency to predict "True" versus "False"? What might cause biases toward one prediction over the other?

9. For future work, what other probing tasks could provide additional insights into these models' reasoning capacities beyond what NLVR tests?

10. The paper finds significant room for improvement across all models on NLVR. What architectural changes or training modifications could potentially close this gap with human performance?
