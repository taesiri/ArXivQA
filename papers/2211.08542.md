# [CXTrack: Improving 3D Point Cloud Tracking with Contextual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08542)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question/hypothesis of this paper is how to fully utilize contextual information across consecutive frames to improve 3D single object tracking performance. 

Specifically, the authors observe that existing methods for 3D single object tracking tend to crop the target object from the point clouds, which results in loss of useful contextual information. They hypothesize that exploiting contextual information around the target object can lead to more robust tracking, especially in cases where the target has large appearance variations across frames or when there are similar distracting objects nearby. 

To validate this hypothesis, the authors propose a new tracking paradigm and method called CXTrack that takes the full point clouds from consecutive frames as input and employs a target-centric transformer architecture to propagate target information across frames while exploring contextual clues. They also design a localization head called X-RPN to distinguish the target from distractors using a novel center embedding mechanism. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and robustness of their method, validating the importance of leveraging contextual information for 3D single object tracking.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that utilizing contextual information across consecutive 3D point cloud frames can significantly improve single object tracking accuracy and robustness compared to existing paradigms. The CXTrack method and experiments are designed to validate this hypothesis.
