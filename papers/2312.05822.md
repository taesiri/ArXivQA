# [Toward Open-ended Embodied Tasks Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper tackles the challenge of empowering embodied AI agents like robots with the ability to flexibly perform tasks with open-ended goals. Unlike traditional AI that focuses on discrete environments and constrained tasks, embodied AI operates in the complex physical world, from simple navigation to complex manipulation. The key problem is that real-world tasks often have highly diverse, multifaceted, and dynamic goals which are impossible to fully cover during training. For example, asking a robot to "assist with household chores" requires skills like vacuuming, cooking and adapting over time. Hence there is a need for enhanced decision-making capacity that can handle novel goal scenarios beyond the training distribution.

Solution: 
The paper proposes a framework called "Diffusion for Open-ended Goals (DOG)" which combines generative capabilities of diffusion models with training-free guidance techniques to enable online planning and control for open-ended goals not seen during training. 

It has two stages - Training and Testing/Deployment:

Training Stage:
Learns an unconditional diffusion model from offline trajectories to acquire the dynamics and latent structure of the environment, without encoding any goal conditioning or rewards.

Testing Stage:
Given a novel task description, it translates this into an energy function that is minimized to obtain goal-consistent state plans using the diffuser and classifier guidance. These plans are then executed by a learned goal-conditioned controller.

Together this allows handling new composite goals, adapting to new environments, manipulating robotic velocity/position and even following natural language commands - none of which were seen during offline training phase.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel formulation to model open-ended embodied tasks using energy functions over state sequences. 
2) Proposed DOG framework combining diffusion models and classifier guidance for flexible online planning and execution.
3) Evaluations across navigation, control and manipulation showing the approach handles diverse unseen goals effectively.

The core idea is to separate the offline world-model learning from online planning to enable handling more open-ended goals at test time. This helps advance embodied AI towards flexible real-world functionality.
