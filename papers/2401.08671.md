# [DeepSpeed-FastGen: High-throughput Text Generation for LLMs via MII and   DeepSpeed-Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deploying and scaling large language models (LLMs) is critical as they are used in many applications, requiring high-throughput and low-latency serving systems. 
- Existing frameworks like vLLM struggle to balance these requirements, especially for workloads with long prompts.
- Long prompt workloads becoming more important as models support longer context windows (e.g. tens of thousands of tokens).
- Text generation happens in two phases: prompt processing and generation. Treating them separately risks breaking service level agreements (SLAs).

Proposed Solution:
- Introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a system that uses "Dynamic SplitFuse", a novel prompt and generation composition strategy.
- Leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide an efficient and easy-to-use serving system.
- Dynamic SplitFuse decomposes long prompts into smaller chunks scheduled across iterations with only the final pass doing generation.
- Short prompts are composed to precisely fill a target token budget to ensure consistent batch sizes.

Benefits:
- Up to 2.3x higher effective throughput.
- 2x lower latency on average. 
- Up to 3.7x lower (token-level) tail latency compared to vLLM.
- Better responsiveness for long prompts.
- Higher efficiency by running at consistent batch sizes.
- Lower variance and better consistency in latency.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of factors impacting LLM forward pass and throughput.
- Introduction of Dynamic SplitFuse strategy for prompt/generation composition.
- Leveraging DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference for easy-to-use serving.
- Extensive benchmarking showing substantial gains over vLLM.
- Open-source release of DeepSpeed-FastGen for community contribution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

DeepSpeed-FastGen leverages a novel prompt and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse along with DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to deliver an easy-to-use and performant serving system for large language models that provides up to 2.3x higher throughput, 2x lower latency, and 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the proposal of Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy for serving large language models. Specifically:

- Dynamic SplitFuse decomposes long prompts into smaller chunks that are scheduled across multiple forward passes, while short prompts are composed to fill a target token budget. This results in more consistent and efficient forward pass sizes.

- By enabling concurrent prompt processing and generation, Dynamic SplitFuse provides lower latency, higher throughput, and lower variance in generation latency compared to prior systems like vLLM. 

- The paper presents DeepSpeed-FastGen which implements Dynamic SplitFuse using a combination of DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference. Experiments show DeepSpeed-FastGen can achieve up to 2.3x higher effective throughput and up to 3.7x lower tail latency compared to vLLM.

In summary, the main contribution is the Dynamic SplitFuse technique and its implementation in DeepSpeed-FastGen to advance the state-of-the-art in serving performance for large language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- DeepSpeed-FastGen - The name of the system introduced in the paper for high-throughput text generation with large language models.

- Dynamic SplitFuse - The novel prompt and generation composition strategy proposed in the paper to improve throughput and latency. 

- DeepSpeed-MII - Used in combination with DeepSpeed-Inference to provide the serving system infrastructure.

- Throughput - A key performance metric measured, with a focus on "effective throughput" for real-world chat scenarios.

- Latency - Another critical performance metric analyzed, including tail latency reduction.

- Continuous batching - The technique of making scheduling decisions at each model forward pass, employed by DeepSpeed-FastGen. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - The class of models targeted, such as GPT-3, LLaMA, etc that are permeating many AI applications.

- Serving systems - The focus of the paper is building high-performance serving systems for deploying and scaling LLMs.

So in summary - DeepSpeed-FastGen, Dynamic SplitFuse, DeepSpeed-MII, throughput, latency, continuous batching, LLMs, and serving systems seem to be some of the key terms associated with this paper. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel prompt and generation composition strategy called Dynamic SplitFuse. Can you explain in detail how Dynamic SplitFuse works and why it is useful compared to prior techniques? 

2. The paper demonstrates lower latency and higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems like vLLM. What specific optimizations in Dynamic SplitFuse contribute to these performance improvements?

3. The concept of "effective throughput" is introduced to capture metrics important for interactive applications like chat. What is effective throughput, how is it measured, and why is it a better metric than raw throughput?  

4. The paper argues that token count in the forward pass matters much more than batch size for performance. Why would this be the case? What implications does this have for scheduling and batching strategies?

5. Dynamic SplitFuse leverages the idea that equal partitioning of tokens across forward passes maximizes throughput for concave throughput-latency curves. Explain why this partitioning scheme is optimal and how Dynamic SplitFuse achieves it.  

6. Can you walk through Figure 5 illustrating the various continuous batching strategies and highlight the key differences between them, especially contrasting Dynamic SplitFuse?

7. The system combines both DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference. What is the motivation behind this synergistic combination and what does each component provide?

8. What models and hardware platforms are currently supported? What considerations are there in adding support for new models and platforms?  

9. Compare and contrast the non-persistent pipeline and persistent serving deployment options. What are the tradeoffs and when would you pick one deployment mode over the other?

10. The paper mentions a few items on the development roadmap such as new hardware backends. Can you speculate on what some of these new hardware options might be and the technical challenges associated with supporting them?
