# [PAHD: Perception-Action based Human Decision Making using Explainable   Graph Neural Networks on SAR Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02687)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- SAR images are used in military applications for automatic target recognition (ATR) of objects like tanks using machine learning models like CNNs and GNNs. 
- Identifying the vehicle class is crucial to determine if a target is an ally or enemy.
- While ML models provide target feedback, final decisions are made by commanding officers. Providing them detailed supporting information can significantly impact their actions.  
- GNNs are complex black boxes and there are concerns over bias which can have far-reaching consequences in military applications. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an explainable GNN framework for SAR image ATR that provides the classified target class along with detailed analysis to aid decision-making.
- It represents a SAR image as a graph with pixels as vertices connected to 8-neighbors. GraphSAGE GNN is used with CNN-style pooling and attention modules.
- The framework has an Information Collector module that shows the most critical pixels for classification and top target class probabilities.

Main Contributions:
- First study to provide detailed classification analysis to simplify decision-making for officers.
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.2% on MSTAR dataset with a smaller model size. 
- Analysis shows correct classifications use target and shadow features while misclassifications rely more on background. 
- Suggests officers consider potential influence of background in decision-making for misclassifications.
- Overall, provides accurate and reliable ATR with explainability for high-stakes military applications.

In summary, the paper proposes an explainable GraphSAGE GNN framework for SAR ATR that achieves SOTA accuracy while providing officers detailed supporting information to aid transparent and fair decision-making.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an explainable graph neural network framework for automatic target recognition in synthetic aperture radar images that achieves 99.2% accuracy on the MSTAR dataset while providing detailed classification information to support military decision-making.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) framework for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images that provides not only the final classified target class but also detailed explainability information to help decision makers. Specifically:

1) The framework uses a GNN model to classify SAR images of ground vehicles into different classes with 99.2% accuracy on the MSTAR dataset, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. 

2) The framework has an "Information Collector" module that provides explainability by showing the SAR image pixels that contributed most to the classification, as well as the top probability scores for the predicted class and other potential classes. 

3) This explainability information is intended to help military decision makers by highlighting when the classification relies more on background noise versus actual target features, allowing them to factor that into their decisions and not solely depend on the classifier output.

4) The authors propose this is the first study to provide such detailed explainability analysis to simplify and improve decision making for SAR image target recognition systems.

In summary, the main contribution is an accurate and explainable GNN framework for SAR ATR that provides additional details to assist decision makers instead of just giving a black-box classification.
