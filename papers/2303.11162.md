# [Picture that Sketch: Photorealistic Image Generation from Abstract   Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11162)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate photorealistic images from abstract human sketches? 

The key points about the research question are:

- The goal is to generate photorealistic images from sketches. So the task is sketch-to-image generation.

- The sketches are "abstract human sketches" rather than clean line drawings or edge maps. So the sketches are hand-drawn by amateurs and can be very abstract. 

- Existing methods fail to generate good results from such abstract sketches. The paper aims to address this limitation.

In summary, the main research question is how to bridge the abstraction gap and generate photorealistic images even from highly abstract free-hand sketches made by amateurs. The paper proposes a new model architecture and training process to achieve this.
