# [Picture that Sketch: Photorealistic Image Generation from Abstract   Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11162)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we generate photorealistic images from abstract human sketches? 

The key points about the research question are:

- The goal is to generate photorealistic images from sketches. So the task is sketch-to-image generation.

- The sketches are "abstract human sketches" rather than clean line drawings or edge maps. So the sketches are hand-drawn by amateurs and can be very abstract. 

- Existing methods fail to generate good results from such abstract sketches. The paper aims to address this limitation.

In summary, the main research question is how to bridge the abstraction gap and generate photorealistic images even from highly abstract free-hand sketches made by amateurs. The paper proposes a new model architecture and training process to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a novel method for photorealistic image generation from abstract freehand sketches. The key ideas and innovations are:

- A decoupled encoder-decoder training paradigm, where the decoder is a pre-trained frozen StyleGAN that ensures photorealistic outputs. The encoder is trained separately to map sketches to StyleGAN's latent space.

- An autoregressive sketch mapper that handles the varying abstraction levels in sketches by predicting only a few latent codes for abstract sketches and more codes for detailed sketches. 

- A fine-grained discriminative loss based on a pre-trained sketch-photo retrieval model that captures the fine details in the sketch better than just reconstruction loss.

- A partial-aware sketch augmentation strategy to make the model robust to incomplete and sparse sketches.

Overall, the main contribution is developing an end-to-end model tailored for abstract sketch to photorealistic image generation by handling challenges like abstraction, sparsity, deformations in sketches through innovative designs like the autoregressive mapper, fine-grained loss etc. The results showcase the model's superior performance compared to previous arts.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel autoregressive sketch-to-photo generation model that leverages a pre-trained StyleGAN to produce photorealistic images from abstract free-hand sketches, enabling fine-grained control over the output by predicting latent vectors in a sequential manner based on the input sketch detail.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key comparisons between this paper and other related research on photorealistic image generation from sketches:

- Unlike many prior works that use edge maps or other pseudo-sketches, this paper focuses on generating photorealistic images from freehand abstract human sketches. This is a more challenging problem due to the greater abstraction gap between sketches and photos. 

- The proposed method differs from typical image-to-image translation approaches like pix2pix by decoupling the training of the generator (pre-trained StyleGAN) and encoder/sketch mapper. This avoids the common issue of deformed outputs caused by pixel alignment assumptions.

- The autoregressive sketch mapper and incorporation of a fine-grained discriminative loss are novel techniques aimed at better capturing the semantic intent from abstract sketches compared to prior generative models.

- Evaluations demonstrate superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods like pix2pix, CycleGAN, MUNIT in terms of standard metrics and human opinion scores. The method also shows good generalization to unseen sketch datasets.

- Downstream applications like fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval and precise semantic editing showcase unique capabilities enabled by this photorealistic sketch-to-image generation approach.

Overall, the key innovations seem to be in tackling abstraction differences, avoiding pixel alignment assumptions, and better capturing semantic intent from sketches. The decoupled training strategy and new loss terms aid in producing photorealistic rather than deformed outputs. The quantitative and qualitative results verify improved generation quality and sketch mapping abilities compared to related works.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring different autoregressive sequential models like LSTMs, RNNs, transformers etc. for the sketch mapper to model the sequential dependency among the latent codes. The current work uses a simple GRU but mentions exploring other models as future work.

- Investigating conditional discriminator models like AC-GAN to provide additional conditionings like viewpoint, fine-grained attributes etc. during training to enable controllable generation. 

- Extending the current framework to other types of free-hand inputs beyond just sketches, like human poses, scene graphs, layouts etc.

- Applying the proposed method to other downstream applications like image manipulation, editing, inpainting etc. by manipulating the predicted latent code.

- Evaluating how well the model generalizes to other sketch datasets, categories and drawing styles that are significantly different in distribution from the training data.

- Exploring semi-supervised or unsupervised training strategies to reduce dependency on sketch-photo pairs.

- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics beyond FID and LPIPS that can measure both photorealism and sketch-photo alignment.

- Investigating the latent space learned by the sketch mapper to identify interpretable directions that lead to semantic edits.

So in summary, the main future directions are around exploring different model architectures, extending to other input modalities, evaluating generalization, reducing supervision, developing better evaluation metrics and interpreting the latent space.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for generating photorealistic images from abstract free-hand sketches. The key idea is to train a sketch mapper model that maps input sketches to the latent space of a pre-trained StyleGAN generator. This allows leveraging the high quality image manifold learned by StyleGAN while avoiding the locality bias issue in typical encoder-decoder image translation models. The sketch mapper is trained in an autoregressive manner on sketch-photo pairs using a combination of reconstruction, fine-grained discriminative, and distillation losses. It can handle varying levels of abstraction by controlling how many latent vectors are predicted from the sketch. Experiments show the method generates higher quality and more diverse outputs compared to existing approaches and enables applications like fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval and semantic editing. The decoupled training paradigm ensures photorealism while the autoregressive sketch mapper bridges the abstraction gap between sketch and photo.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for generating photorealistic images from abstract freehand sketches. The key innovation is a decoupled training approach where the image generator (decoder) is pretrained on photos using StyleGAN, while the sketch encoder is trained separately to map sketches to the latent space of the fixed generator. This avoids the common issue in end-to-end models of the output image being constrained to follow the sketch lines too closely, resulting in unrealistic outputs. 

The sketch encoder uses an autoregressive design to map sketches to the hierarchical latent space of StyleGAN in a coarse-to-fine manner. This allows controlling the level of abstraction by limiting the number of predicted latent vectors. The encoder is trained with sketch-photo pairs using a combination of reconstruction, perceptual, and novel fine-grained discriminative losses. The discriminative loss ensures the output matches the fine details in the sketch based on a pretrained sketch-photo retrieval model. Experiments demonstrate superior results to prior methods, with the ability to generate photorealistic and diverse outputs even from highly abstract sketch inputs across multiple datasets. Downstream tasks enabled by the model include sketch-based image retrieval by generating photos from query sketches and precise semantic editing of outputs by modifying input sketches.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel sketch-to-photo generation model that can generate photorealistic images from highly abstract human sketches. The key innovation is a decoupled training approach where the decoder is a pre-trained StyleGAN model frozen after training on real photos, ensuring photorealistic outputs. The encoder is an autoregressive sketch mapper trained on sketch-photo pairs to map sketches to StyleGAN's latent space. It uses a fine-grained discriminative loss based on a pre-trained sketch-photo retrieval model to capture fine details from the sketch, and a partial-aware augmentation strategy to handle abstraction. This allows it to handle informal human sketches rather than just aligned edgemaps like prior works. The sketch mapper model with these components can map sketches of varying abstraction into StyleGAN's latent space to generate photorealistic and detailed images that reflect the sketch content.
