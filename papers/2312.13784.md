# [Benchmarking Evolutionary Community Detection Algorithms in Dynamic   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13784)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Detecting evolving communities in dynamic networks is challenging. Naively applying algorithms like the Greedy Modularity Algorithm (GMA) independently on network snapshots fails to maintain temporal consistency in community assignments. 
- Existing solutions like Stabilised GMA (sGMA) and Louvain with memory (αGMA) improve temporal coherence but may struggle with tracking emerging communities or abrupt changes.
- Lack of proper benchmarking frameworks and quality metrics makes evaluating and comparing evolutionary community detection algorithms difficult.

Proposed Solution:
- A benchmarking framework to generate synthetic dynamic networks with ground truth community assignments and simulate different transformation scenarios like noise, morphing, disruptions.
- Three new quality metrics - Correctness, Delay and Stability to evaluate evolutionary algorithms from different perspectives.
- A novel balanced algorithm called Neighbourhood-based GMA (NeGMA) that overcomes limitations of prior arts.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive benchmarking framework and quality metrics to test evolutionary community detection algorithms.
- In-depth comparison of sGMA, αGMA and proposed NeGMA - each offers different tradeoffs.
- NeGMA emerges as most balanced solution with high responsiveness, instantaneous change detection ability and competitive stability.
- Experimental analysis provides insights like αGMA suits intermittent changes but struggles with abrupt ones, sGMA prioritises stability over emerging community detection.
- Framework and findings can inspire future works in evolutionary community detection.

In summary, the paper makes methodological and empirical contributions towards advancing research in dynamic community detection through the design of appropriate benchmarking tools. The proposed NeGMA algorithm also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.
