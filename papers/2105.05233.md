# [Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that diffusion models can achieve better image sample quality compared to GANs. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:- With improved architectures, diffusion models can obtain state-of-the-art results on unconditional image synthesis tasks.- By using classifier guidance, diffusion models can achieve state-of-the-art results on conditional image synthesis tasks. - Classifier guidance allows diffusion models to trade off diversity for fidelity, similar to truncation in GANs. This allows them to produce higher quality samples while still maintaining good coverage of the distribution.- Diffusion models can match or beat GANs like BigGAN in terms of metrics like FID, while requiring comparable or lower compute budgets.To test these hypotheses, the authors conduct architecture ablations, propose a classifier guidance technique, apply it to conditional and unconditional image generation on datasets like ImageNet and LSUN, and compare the results to state-of-the-art GANs. The experimental results support their central hypothesis that diffusion models can surpass GANs on image sample quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces Diffusion Models, a new class of generative models that can generate high-quality images. The key contributions are:- Proposes diffusion models, which train neural networks to reverse a gradual noising process in order to generate images. The models are trained by adding noise to real images and learning to predict the noise component. - Shows that diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art sample quality on image generation benchmarks like LSUN bedrooms, horses, and cats. The models obtain better FID scores than previous likelihood-based models and GANs.- Demonstrates that diffusion models can scale to complex datasets like ImageNet at resolutions up to 512x512. The models obtain better FID than BigGAN while capturing more diversity. - Introduces classifier guidance, which uses gradients from an image classifier to guide the sampling process. This allows trading off diversity for sample quality, further improving results.- Combines classifier guidance and upsampling models to achieve an FID of 3.85 on ImageNet 512x512, surpassing BigGAN.So in summary, the main contribution is introducing diffusion models as a new class of generative model that can achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis results by reversing a noising process. The paper shows these models can scale to complex domains and can be further improved with classifier guidance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper shows that diffusion models can achieve better image sample quality than GANs on unconditional and conditional image synthesis tasks, through architectural improvements and a method to trade off diversity for fidelity using classifier guidance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in diffusion models and generative image modeling:- It shows that diffusion models can surpass GANs in image quality on challenging datasets like ImageNet, where previous work with diffusion models fell short of GANs. This helps make the case for diffusion models as a promising class of generative models.- It introduces a simple but effective technique called classifier guidance to improve sample quality by trading off diversity. This provides a way to get higher fidelity samples from diffusion models, similar to truncation in GANs. - It demonstrates state-of-the-art unconditional sample quality on datasets like LSUN bedrooms, horses, and cats. Previous works have shown good results on smaller datasets, but this extends it to more challenging domains.- It shows diffusion models can be quite compute-efficient, matching BigGAN-deep quality with 8x less compute on ImageNet 128x128. This helps address one limitation of likelihood-based models compared to GANs.- It combines guidance with upsampling diffusion models for improved ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 results. This shows these techniques are complementary. - Compared to other likelihood-based models like VAEs, flows, and autoregressive models, it shows diffusion models as the current top performer on image modeling, whereas those other classes of models have fallen short of GANs.Overall, this work pushes diffusion models forward as a leading contender in generative image modeling, demonstrating they can surpass GANs and efficiently scale to large and diverse datasets. It introduces techniques to close gaps compared to GANs in sample quality and sampling speed.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring ways to reduce the sampling time of diffusion models, perhaps through distillation approaches. The authors note diffusion models still require multiple sampling steps, making them slower than GANs. Reducing the number of sampling steps needed could help close this gap.- Extending classifier guidance to unlabeled datasets. The current technique relies on labeled data, so developing methods to trade off diversity and fidelity without labels could expand the applicability. Some ideas mentioned are using synthetic labels from clustering or training models to detect when samples match the data distribution.- Using classifier guidance in more diverse ways by incorporating other pretrained models like CLIP. For example, conditioning an image generator on text captions by using a noised CLIP model.- Pretraining powerful diffusion models on large unlabeled datasets which can later be improved with classifier guidance on downstream tasks. The effectiveness of guidance suggests leveraging both unlabeled and labeled data could be very promising.- Combining classifier guidance with other types of models like energy-based models. The general principle of using classifier gradients to shape generations may transfer to other likelihood-based models.- Developing better quantitative evaluation metrics for generative models. The authors note metrics like FID are imperfect proxies for human judgement of quality. New metrics could better capture aspects like coherence and precision.In summary, the main directions are improving sampling speed, extending classifier guidance to unlabeled data, using guidance in more diverse ways by incorporating other models, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through pretraining, applying similar ideas to other model classes, and developing better evaluation metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes improvements to diffusion generative models to achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis on multiple datasets. The authors first introduce architectural changes like wider models, more attention heads, and adaptive group normalization to substantially boost sample quality. They then propose classifier guidance, which uses gradients from an image classifier during sampling to trade off diversity for fidelity. This allows them to surpass GANs on class-conditional image generation tasks, achieving an FID of 2.97 on ImageNet 128x128, 4.59 on ImageNet 256x256, and 7.72 on ImageNet 512x512. Using classifier guidance, they can match BigGAN-deep quality with only 25 sampling steps. Combining guidance and upsampling yields an FID of 3.85 on ImageNet 512x512. Overall, the improved architecture and classifier guidance allow diffusion models to achieve better sample quality than GANs while maintaining diversity and training stability.
