# [BoostDream: Efficient Refining for High-Quality Text-to-3D Generation   from Multi-View Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16764)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Two main approaches exist for text-to-3D generation: feed-forward methods and SDS optimization methods. Feed-forward methods are fast but produce lower quality assets limited by small 3D datasets. SDS methods use 2D diffusion models to produce high quality assets but are slow. 

- There is a need for an efficient method to generate high quality 3D assets that combines the strengths of both approaches.

Proposed Solution - BoostDream:
- A 3-stage framework to efficiently refine coarse 3D assets into high quality assets

1. Initialization: Fits coarse 3D assets from feed-forward methods into differentiable 3D representations like NeRF to make them trainable

2. Boost: Uses a novel multi-view render system and multi-view SDS loss based on a 2D diffusion model. Guidance is provided using prompt and multi-view normal maps for consistency. Addresses the Janus problem.  

3. Self-Boost: Refines further using only self-supervision from multi-view normal maps

Main Contributions:
- An integration of feed-forward and SDS-based text-to-3D generation that is efficient and produces high quality assets
- A multi-view SDS approach with guidance from prompts and normal maps that solves the Janus problem
- Demonstrated generalizability to different 3D representations like NeRF, DMTet, 3D Gaussians  

The method advances both efficiency and quality compared to existing text-to-3D techniques. Extensive experiments validate the performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes BoostDream, an efficient 3D refining method with a three-stage pipeline—initialization, boost with multi-view guidance, and self-boost—that combines a feed-forward approach for fast generation with a multi-view score distillation loss for high-quality refinement, overcoming limitations of existing text-to-3D generation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. It proposes a novel method called BoostDream that integrates the advances in feed-forward and SDS-based text-to-3D generation methods. This enables efficient and high-quality refinement of 3D assets. 

2. It innovatively proposes the multi-view SDS with a multi-view render system to refine 3D assets under multi-view conditions and address the Janus problem.

3. BoostDream can generate high-quality 3D assets based on a variety of 3D differentiable representations, showcasing strong generalizability.

In summary, the key contribution is the BoostDream framework that can efficiently transform coarse 3D assets into refined, high-quality 3D assets by leveraging multi-view guidance. It demonstrates improved quality and speed over existing text-to-3D generation techniques.
