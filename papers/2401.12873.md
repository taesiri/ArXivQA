# [Improving Machine Translation with Human Feedback: An Exploration of   Quality Estimation as a Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12873)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Integrating real human feedback to improve neural machine translation (NMT) has been challenging due to insufficient modeling of human preferences in the reward model. 

- This paper explores using recent advancements in quality estimation (QE) models as reward models for feedback training of NMT models. QE models can estimate translation quality without references.

Solution:
- The authors first identify an "overoptimization" problem when using QE models for feedback training - reward increases but actual translation quality declines over time. 

- Analysis shows vulnerability of QE models leading to high rewards for incorrect translations, causing them to be overoptimized and errors propagating through training.

- A simple yet effective solution is proposed - use heuristic rules to detect incorrect translations (length ratio errors, off-target errors) and assign them a penalty reward to mitigate overoptimization.

Contributions:
- Identified ubiquity of overoptimization problem when using QE models for feedback training across diverse settings.

- Addressed overoptimization via proposed solution, achieving consistent and significant NMT improvements verified through human evaluation.

- Demonstrated high data efficiency - small amount of monolingual data with proposed approach outperforms more parallel data.

- Analyzed effects of base model size, pretraining, and hyperparameters on feedback training performance.

In summary, this paper explores using QE models to provide human preference feedback for improving NMT, addresses the overoptimization issue, and demonstrates consistent gains across settings with high data efficiency. The analysis also provides useful insights into model properties affecting feedback training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper explores using quality estimation models as reward functions for reinforcement learning-based feedback training to improve neural machine translation quality, identifies and addresses an overoptimization issue that arises, and demonstrates consistent improvements across diverse settings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It identifies the "overoptimization" problem when using quality estimation (QE) models as reward models for feedback training in neural machine translation, where the reward increases but actual translation quality declines.

2. It examines the causes of this overoptimization problem, finding that the vulnerability of QE models can lead them to assign high rewards to incorrect translations, resulting in these errors spreading through subsequent training.  

3. It proposes a simple yet effective method to address the overoptimization problem by detecting common error patterns like length ratio errors and off-target errors, and assigning a penalty term to their rewards.

4. By addressing overoptimization, the proposed approach achieves consistent and significant improvements in translation quality across various settings like high/low resource languages, different base models, etc. The improvements are further verified through human evaluation.

5. Further analysis demonstrates the high data efficiency of using QE-based reward models for feedback training, showing it can outperform systems trained on more parallel data by using just a small amount of monolingual data.

In summary, the key contribution is successfully integrating quality estimation models into feedback training for neural machine translation for the first time by identifying and addressing the overoptimization problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Feedback training - Using human feedback signals to fine-tune machine translation models rather than relying solely on parallel data. A core focus of the paper.

- Quality estimation (QE) - Predicting the quality of a machine translation without access to references. QE models are explored as reward models for feedback training.

- Overoptimization - When pursuing higher rewards leads to lower translation quality. A key problem identified when using QE models naively. 

- RAFT - Reward Augmented Fine-tuning. The training algorithm used for feedback training.

- Length ratio errors - One prevalent translation error pattern that led to overoptimization issues. Translations too long or short compared to the source.

- Off-target errors - Another translation error pattern, where the output is in the wrong target language.

- Reward model - A model that provides signals to reinforce desired behavior during training. QE models are tested as reward models.

- Alignment with human preferences - A goal in recent work on large language models, using techniques like feedback training.

The key ideas revolve around using QE to provide rewards for feedback training of machine translation models, while addressing resulting overoptimization problems.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper identifies an "overoptimization" problem when using QE-based reward models for feedback training. What is the root cause of this problem and how does it manifest during training?

2. The paper proposes detecting length ratio and off-target errors and assigning penalties to the rewards for these error cases. What is the intuition behind this method? How effective is it in alleviating overoptimization?

3. The paper experiments with different quality estimation (QE) models as reward functions. How does the performance vary across different QE models and what does this suggest about the maturity of QE models? 

4. Human evaluation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed feedback training method. What specific aspects of translation quality seem to improve the most from human judgment?

5. The analysis shows high data efficiency for the proposed feedback training approach. How does it compare with simply using more parallel training data? What implications does this have?

6. The base model architecture and pretraining are shown to impact feedback training results. What trends are observed regarding model size, pretraining, and final translation gains? What hypotheses are provided to explain these trends?

7. What are some limitations of the training algorithm, QE granularity, multilingual imbalance issues, and error detection that are acknowledged? How might future work address some of these limitations?

8. Could the proposed method potentially be applied to other text generation tasks beyond machine translation? What challenges might arise in those scenarios?

9. One issue mentioned is "uneven distribution of rewards" for different translation directions. What causes this and how might it be addressed? What new techniques could help ensure balanced rewards?

10. The paper mostly focuses on sentence-level QE. How might integrating other levels of QE (e.g. word, document) require modifying the overall approach and methodology? What new research problems might arise?
