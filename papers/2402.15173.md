# [Second-Order Fine-Tuning without Pain for LLMs:A Hessian Informed   Zeroth-Order Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is important for adapting them to specific downstream tasks. However, conventional first-order optimizers like Adam have high GPU memory consumption due to backpropagation. Recent works use memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizers like MeZO with just forward passes, but they suffer from slow convergence due to heterogeneity of curvatures across parameters.  

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian-informed zeroth order optimizer for fine-tuning LLMs. HiZOO estimates the diagonal Hessian using forward passes to account for heterogeneity of curvatures. Specifically:

1) It estimates the diagonal Hessian by accessing loss values at perturbed parameters based on zeroth-order oracles. This requires only one extra forward pass per step compared to MeZO.

2) The estimated diagonal Hessian is used to scale the parameter updates during gradient descent. This allows faster convergence by adjusting step sizes based on curvatures.

3) Theoretical analysis shows HiZOO can converge to optimum under common assumptions and handles heterogeneity effectively.

Main Contributions:

1) First work to incorporate diagonal Hessian estimation in zeroth-order optimizer for fine-tuning LLMs to address curvature heterogeneity.

2) Requires only one extra forward pass but accelerates convergence by 5x on average over MeZO.

3) Achieves better accuracy than MeZO in most cases, across model types, scales and tasks. For example, reduces training steps by 30x on SST-2 while achieving 3% higher accuracy.

4) Compatible with full-tuning, LoRA and prefix tuning methods. Outperforms MeZO consistently in most configurations.  

5) Visualizations on test functions demonstrate HiZOO's effectiveness in handling heterogeneity of curvatures.

In summary, HiZOO is a principled way to accelerate zeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs by adjusting for curvature heterogeneity using diagonal Hessian estimation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer to enhance the convergence when fine-tuning large language models that exhibit heterogeneous curvatures across parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing HiZOO, a diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer, which is the first work to leverage the diagonal Hessian to enhance zeroth-order optimizer for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). HiZOO only increases one forward pass per step compared to prior zeroth-order methods like MeZO.

2. Providing theoretical analysis to prove that HiZOO provides an unbiased estimation of the Hessian and can achieve global convergence even in cases with heterogeneous curvatures across parameter dimensions. 

3. Conducting extensive experiments on various models (350M - 66B parameters) and tasks to demonstrate HiZOO's effectiveness in accelerating convergence, reducing training steps (up to 30x), and improving accuracy compared to MeZO.

4. Showing HiZOO's compatibility with full-parameter tuning, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and prefix-tuning across all model scales. HiZOO also works well with non-differentiable objectives like F1 score.

5. Visualizing optimization trajectories on test functions to illustrate HiZOO's ability to handle heterogeneous curvatures more effectively compared to MeZO and comparably with Adam.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a Hessian-enhanced zeroth-order optimizer HiZOO for efficient and accurate fine-tuning of large language models.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Large language models (LLMs) - The paper focuses on fine-tuning large pre-trained language models.

- Zeroth-order optimization - The paper proposes using zeroth-order optimization methods like simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) that rely only on function evaluations rather than explicit gradients. This saves memory.

- Diagonal Hessian estimation - The paper introduces estimating the diagonal Hessian matrix entries to account for heterogeneous curvatures across parameters. This helps zeroth-order optimization handle different curvatures. 

- Convergence analysis - The paper provides theoretical analysis to prove the convergence of the proposed diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimizer (HiZOO).

- Memory efficient fine-tuning - A key focus is enabling memory efficient fine-tuning of large models by using HiZOO instead of standard first-order methods.

- Parameter efficient fine-tuning - Experiments show HiZOO works with parameter efficient methods like LoRA and prefix tuning.

- Accelerated convergence - Results demonstrate HiZOO converges much faster than prior zeroth-order optimizer MeZO.

So in summary, the key ideas focus around using diagonal Hessian informed zeroth-order optimization to efficiently fine-tune large language models.
