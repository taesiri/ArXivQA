# [FocalPose++: Focal Length and Object Pose Estimation via Render and   Compare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02985)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Estimating the 6D pose (3D rotation and translation) of a known object from a single RGB image is an important task with applications like augmented reality. Prior work requires either depth data, calibrated cameras, or multiple images. This paper tackles the more challenging problem of jointly estimating the 6D pose and focal length of the camera from a single RGB image, with no access to depth data or camera calibration. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes FocalPose++, a neural render-and-compare approach. Given an input image showing an object and its corresponding 3D model from a database, FocalPose++ iteratively renders the model from different hypothetical poses and focal lengths, compares to the input image, and updates the estimates to better align the rendered model with the depicted object.

Key ideas:
1. Novel differentiable update rules to update the pose and focal length estimate in each iteration, derived from camera projection equations.

2. Disentangled loss function, regressing directly on focal length but having separate terms to supervise pose alignment due to changes in xy translation, depth translation, and rotation. This leads to faster training convergence.

3. Sampling synthetic training data for focal length and pose from a parametric model fitted to the real data. This introduces useful prior knowledge about typical poses.


Main Contributions:

1. Extension of state-of-the-art pose estimation method by a novel focal length update rule and modified pose update rules derived from camera projection. Enables joint optimization in render-and-compare framework.

2. Carefully designed training loss, with a disentangled pose loss and combination of direct focal length regression together with focal-aware reprojection loss.

3. Analysis of synthetic data sampling strategies for robust generalization. Fitting distributions to real data works better than uniformly random or purely synthetic sampling.

The proposed FocalPose++ significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art on standard datasets, reducing relative errors in focal length by about 20-50%. The approach also generalizes successfully to hundreds of object models.
