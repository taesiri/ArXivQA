# [Learning Personalized High Quality Volumetric Head Avatars from   Monocular RGB Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we learn high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos that can be rendered with controllable expressions and viewpoints? The key points related to this question seem to be:- Existing methods for high-quality avatar generation require extensive hardware setups or manual intervention. The authors aim to generate avatars purely from short monocular RGB videos.- The authors propose a hybrid pipeline that combines a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) with a neural radiance field representation. This allows leveraging the 3DMM for geometry and tracking while using the neural radiance field for photorealistic rendering.- A core contribution is predicting expression-dependent features on the 3DMM mesh vertices to capture fine details. The features are predicted using a convolutional neural network in UV space for better generalization.- Experiments demonstrate they can reconstruct high-quality avatars from monocular video that have accurate expressions, details like wrinkles and hair, and can render novel views well. Comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods show improved quality.In summary, the main hypothesis is that by combining a 3DMM with a neural radiance field and using a convolutional network to predict localized expression-dependent features on the 3DMM vertices, they can learn controllable high-quality head avatars from monocular RGB video. The experiments aim to validate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a method to learn high quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos. The learned avatar can be controlled via a parametric face model to achieve user-specified expressions and poses. 2. Combining a 3D morphable model (3DMM) with a neural radiance field representation to leverage the geometry priors and tracking from the 3DMM while achieving photorealistic rendering and fine details through the neural radiance field.3. Learning to predict local expression-dependent features anchored to the 3DMM geometry. This helps reduce over-smoothing and improve synthesis of out-of-model expressions. The features are predicted using a convolutional neural network in UV space to incorporate spatial context. 4. Demonstrating that the proposed method can reconstruct high quality avatars with accurate expression details, good generalization to unseen expressions, and quantitatively better rendering compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, the key contribution is developing a hybrid 3DMM and neural radiance field approach for reconstructing controllable head avatars from monocular RGB video, and showing its effectiveness compared to other methods. The proposed techniques for predicting local expression-dependent features using UV space convolutions are also novel.
