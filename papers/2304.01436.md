# [Learning Personalized High Quality Volumetric Head Avatars from   Monocular RGB Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01436)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can we learn high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos that can be rendered with controllable expressions and viewpoints? 

The key points related to this question seem to be:

- Existing methods for high-quality avatar generation require extensive hardware setups or manual intervention. The authors aim to generate avatars purely from short monocular RGB videos.

- The authors propose a hybrid pipeline that combines a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) with a neural radiance field representation. This allows leveraging the 3DMM for geometry and tracking while using the neural radiance field for photorealistic rendering.

- A core contribution is predicting expression-dependent features on the 3DMM mesh vertices to capture fine details. The features are predicted using a convolutional neural network in UV space for better generalization.

- Experiments demonstrate they can reconstruct high-quality avatars from monocular video that have accurate expressions, details like wrinkles and hair, and can render novel views well. Comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods show improved quality.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that by combining a 3DMM with a neural radiance field and using a convolutional network to predict localized expression-dependent features on the 3DMM vertices, they can learn controllable high-quality head avatars from monocular RGB video. The experiments aim to validate this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a method to learn high quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos. The learned avatar can be controlled via a parametric face model to achieve user-specified expressions and poses. 

2. Combining a 3D morphable model (3DMM) with a neural radiance field representation to leverage the geometry priors and tracking from the 3DMM while achieving photorealistic rendering and fine details through the neural radiance field.

3. Learning to predict local expression-dependent features anchored to the 3DMM geometry. This helps reduce over-smoothing and improve synthesis of out-of-model expressions. The features are predicted using a convolutional neural network in UV space to incorporate spatial context. 

4. Demonstrating that the proposed method can reconstruct high quality avatars with accurate expression details, good generalization to unseen expressions, and quantitatively better rendering compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a hybrid 3DMM and neural radiance field approach for reconstructing controllable head avatars from monocular RGB video, and showing its effectiveness compared to other methods. The proposed techniques for predicting local expression-dependent features using UV space convolutions are also novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to learn high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos by combining a 3D morphable model with a neural radiance field representation; the model learns expression-dependent features attached to the 3DMM mesh vertices using a convolutional neural network in UV space to enable rendering of photorealistic avatars with controllable facial expressions and head poses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for learning personalized 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos. The key contributions compared to prior work are:

- Hybrid pipeline combining 3D morphable models (3DMMs) and neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for controllability and photorealism. Most prior work uses either explicit models like 3DMMs or implicit models like NeRFs, but this combines them for the benefits of both.

- Learning local features anchored to 3DMM geometry to capture high-frequency details while retaining geometric constraints. Prior work that combines 3DMMs and NeRFs typically uses global MLPs which leads to over-smoothing.

- Using convolutional neural networks in UV space to learn expression-dependent features for better generalization. Other methods just use MLPs conditioned on 3DMM parameters which don't leverage spatial context. 

- Simple approach to extend mouth interiors for 3DMMs to improve rendering quality. Mouth cavities are often incomplete in 3DMMs so this is an effective enhancement.

Overall, this method achieves state-of-the-art results for monocular head avatar modeling, with improved photorealism, detail, and expression modeling over prior works like NerFACE, RigNeRF, and IMAvatar. The combination of 3DMM shape regularization with flexible neural rendering allows learning avatars from very limited data. The expression-dependent UV space features are a key contribution for quality and generalization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some potential future research directions the authors suggest:

- Extending the method to include the upper body or integrating into full body avatars. The current method focuses on modeling and animating the head region, so expanding it to cover more of the body could be an interesting direction. 

- Improving the temporal stability of the animations. The paper notes there can be some jitter in the animations due to errors in the 3DMM fitting process. Improving the 3DMM and fitting process could help, as could exploring techniques to smooth the animations directly in the neural rendering framework.

- Accelerating the training and inference speed. Like other neural radiance field methods, this approach requires slow subject-specific training and rendering. Research into speeding up these steps could improve the practicality of the method.

- Exploring alternative techniques for modeling mouth interiors and facial topology not present in the 3DMM model, like tongues or eyes. The current method is limited in these regions by the 3DMM topology.

- Developing robustness for more challenging cases like long hair and accessories. Long hair and wearables can currently cause artifacts, so improving robustness in these cases is suggested.

- Applying the method to portrait video editing tasks. The controllable avatar could enable novel video edits like expression or viewpoint changes.

- Extending to multi-view training data. The current method uses only monocular video, but supporting multi-view data could improve view generalization.

- Combining with dynamic texture techniques to achieve video-realistic results. The method focuses on geometry and lighting, so combining with neural video textures could further improve realism.

In summary, the main suggested directions are around improving the avatar fidelity, generalization, efficiency, and applicability to downstream tasks. The hybrid 3DMM and neural rendering approach seems promising but still has room for improvement in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to create high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos. The core idea is to combine a parametric 3D face model (3DMM) with a neural radiance field (NeRF) representation. The 3DMM provides geometric priors and tracking of the face deformation, while the NeRF allows modeling of complex appearance variations not captured by the 3DMM, like hair and facial details. To enable controllability of the avatar via the 3DMM parameters, the method attaches learned features to the 3DMM vertices, which are then interpolated to compute the radiance field. The main novelty is predicting these vertex features from the 3DMM deformations using a convolutional neural network in UV space. This provides better generalization to unseen expressions compared to using MLPs. Experiments show the approach can generate avatars with accurate facial articulation and details from just short monocular RGB video. The results are superior in quality compared to recent state-of-the-art avatar generation techniques.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a method to create high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos captured in the wild. The core of the method is a hybrid pipeline that combines the geometry prior and tracking ability of a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with a neural radiance field representation. The 3DMM provides a parametric face model that enables control over facial expressions and head poses. The neural radiance field representation allows capturing of fine details beyond the 3DMM's capacity, such as hair, glasses and wrinkles. 

To model the complex expression-dependent non-local appearance details, the method proposes predicting local features attached to the 3DMM mesh vertices. These features are predicted using a convolutional neural network in UV space from the 3DMM expression parameters. This allows aggregating spatial context to generate sharper details. The features are attached to the deforming 3DMM mesh vertices during inference and interpolated in 3D to yield the radiance field. Experiments demonstrate superior rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods, with improved generalization to unseen expressions. The avatars show accurate pose and expression control along with realistic hair, skin and accessory details from just short 1-2 minute monocular RGB video capture.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

This paper proposes a method to learn high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos. The core of the method is a neural radiance field representation anchored to a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). The 3DMM provides a parametric model of facial geometry and expressions that serves as a strong prior and enables control over pose and expression. Local feature vectors are attached to the vertices of the deformable 3DMM mesh. These features are predicted using a convolutional neural network operating on the UV texture space of the 3DMM. This allows incorporating spatial context between neighboring vertices. At rendering time, features from the k-nearest vertices are aggregated and fed into small MLPs to produce a volume density and view-dependent color. The model is trained end-to-end using a photometric loss between rendered and ground truth video frames. This hybrid approach combines the benefits of 3DMM priors and neural representation flexibility to enable high quality rendering of facial details beyond the 3DMM model capacity.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be proposing a method for learning high-quality 3D head avatars from monocular RGB videos. Specifically, it aims to address the following problems/questions:

- How to learn photorealistic and controllable 3D head avatars using only casual monocular RGB videos as input (e.g. 1-2 mins selfie videos captured using phone cameras). This makes the setup very accessible but the problem more challenging due to limited data.

- How to combine the geometry priors and tracking abilities of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) with the flexibility and capacity of a neural radiance field to represent complex expressions, hair, accessories etc. that are outside the 3DMM model. 

- How to model detailed expression-dependent effects such as wrinkles while still maintaining good generalization to novel expressions not seen during training. Using global MLPs to model appearance and deformation as done in prior works leads to loss of details.

- The design of network architecture and input representations to enable spatial reasoning, provide regularization, and improve generalization for this task. They propose using CNNs on UV space deformations rather than just 3DMM parameters or MLPs.

In summary, the key focus is on learning controllable high-quality 3D head avatars from very limited casual monocular RGB video data, by combining 3DMMs and neural radiance fields in an effective way. The proposed hybrid framework and design choices allow capturing personalized details while maintaining good generalization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Monocular RGB videos: The paper focuses on learning 3D head avatars from monocular (single camera) RGB video footage, which provides a less constrained capture setup compared to methods requiring specialized equipment.

- 3D Morphable Models (3DMM): 3DMMs provide a parametric model of 3D facial geometry and appearance which serves as a prior and initialization. The paper uses the FLAME 3DMM.

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF): The paper represents the head avatar as a neural radiance field, which can render high quality novel views through volumetric rendering. This allows modeling complex geometry like hair. 

- Anchoring: The radiance field is "anchored" to the 3DMM surface by attaching learned features to 3DMM vertices. This combines the benefits of both parametric and neural implicit representations.

- Expression-dependent features: Features attached to 3DMM vertices are predicted in a way that makes them dependent on the facial expression parameters, enabling modeling of wrinkles and other non-linear expression effects.

- UV space convolutions: A convolutional neural network in the texture space of the 3DMM is used to predict expression-dependent features with spatial context.

- Hybrid 3DMM and NeRF pipeline: The overall pipeline combines 3DMM shape and tracking with a neural radiance field for appearance modeling. This achieves controllability and quality from monocular RGB input.

In summary, the key themes are leveraging 3DMM structure while going beyond its limitations using neural rendering and learning expression-dependent details in an anchored neural radiance field model.
