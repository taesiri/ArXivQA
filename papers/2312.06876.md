# [Interactive Planning Using Large Language Models for Partially   Observable Robotics Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06876)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the challenge of designing robotic agents that can perform open vocabulary tasks involving reasoning under uncertainty. Specifically, it focuses on partially observable tasks where the robot does not initially have full information to complete the task and needs to interact with the environment to gather additional sensory information. Solving such tasks is difficult as it requires chain-of-thought reasoning, state estimation, and action planning based on updated beliefs.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an interactive planning technique using large language models (LLMs) for partially observable tasks. The key ideas are:

1) Use an LLM as a planner to guide the robot to collect missing information, infer the belief state, and plan actions accordingly. The LLM takes as input the task description, current observations, and action-observation history.

2) Add an LLM evaluator that explicitly asks the LLM to perform state abstraction, belief updates, and handle execution errors. This enhances reasoning stability.  

3) Compare pre-trained LLM (GPT-4) against a fine-tuned smaller LLM (Llama2) using a self-instruction based data generation method. This helps understand limitations of smaller models.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of LLM-POP, an interactive planning framework using LLMs for partially observable tasks. Demonstrated in simulation and real-world.  

- Analysis of performance of pre-trained vs fine-tuned LLM models for complex interactive planning. Identified gaps in state abstraction and belief update capabilities.

- Self-instruction based method to generate data and fine-tune smaller LLMs for interactive planning tasks involving reasoning.

The core idea is leveraging reasoning and chain-of-thought capabilities of LLMs to plan optimal actions while interacting with the environment to mitigate uncertainties. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents an interactive planning framework using large language models to solve partially observable long-horizon robotics tasks by gathering missing information, reasoning about state, and generating optimal actions based on updated state estimates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a Large Language Model for Partially Observable Task Planning (LLM-POP) framework to perform interactive planning for robotic tasks under uncertainty and partial observability. The framework allows the robot to gather missing information from the environment and update its belief state.

2. It demonstrates the framework both in simulation and on a real robot system for block rearrangement tasks with uncertainties related to object mass and movability. It shows that the framework can solve tasks reliably even when full information is not available upfront.

3. It compares using a pre-trained large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 versus a fine-tuned smaller LLM like Llama2 as the interactive planner. It proposes a data generation method using self-instruction to create a dataset for fine-tuning. The results analyze the limitations of smaller models for such complex reasoning tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is the interactive planning framework and its demonstration for solving partially observable robotic tasks using capabilities of large language models. The analysis of different LLMs is also a notable contribution.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs): The paper focuses on using large pretrained language models like GPT-4 and Llama2 for interactive planning.

- Partially observable tasks: The tasks considered in the paper have uncertainties and partial observability, requiring the robot to interact with the environment to gather more information.  

- Interactive planning: The proposed LLM-POP framework does interactive, closed-loop planning by gathering observations from the environment, updating state estimates and beliefs, and generating actions.

- Self-instruction: The method used to generate a dataset to fine-tune the Llama2 model by having GPT-4 provide instructive question-answer pairs. 

- Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning: The capability of large language models to perform complex, multi-step reasoning which is needed for planning under uncertainty.

- Belief update: The process of integrating new observations to update the estimate of the underlying state of the environment and task.

- State abstraction: Identifying what information is relevant from observations to represent the state space for decision making in a particular task.

So in summary, key terms cover interactive planning, partial observability, using LLMs, self-instruction based fine-tuning, and leveraging capabilities like CoT reasoning and belief updates.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using LLMs for state abstraction and belief updates. Can you elaborate on how the LLMs are able to understand the underlying state space and perform belief updates based on observations? What capabilities of LLMs make this feasible?

2. The framework uses skills with open-loop policies. How much does this limit the complexity of tasks that can be solved? Could you incorporate closed-loop policies to expand the scope?

3. You compare performance of GPT-4 and a fine-tuned Llama model. What specific gaps did you observe in reasoning capability between these models? How can the gaps be reduced through better tuning/training?

4. Self-instruction is used for generating training data. How does the quality and diversity of generated instructions impact fine-tuning performance? What measures were taken to improve quality?

5. The tasks focused on manipulation with clear goals. How would the framework perform on more open-ended tasks requiring creativity and exploration? Would LLMs be able to handle such tasks?

6. You currently use text prompts to provide observations and history to LLMs. How easy would it be to incorporate raw observations like images? Would transfer learning help incorporate multi-modal inputs?

7. The framework relies heavily on good prompting to LLMs. How labor intensive was it to design the prompts and output templates? Could this process be automated using meta-learning?

8. Safety is a concern when deploying such LLM-based planners on robots. What mechanisms did you incorporate to guarantee safety and prevent unsafe actions?

9. Sim-to-real transfer remains a challenge for robot learning. How sim-to-real compatible is the interactive planning framework? What changes were needed from simulation to real-world?

10. The planner can currently handle 2-3 block tasks. How easily could the approach scale to more complex scenes with many objects and longer horizons? Would hierarchical planning help address scalability?
