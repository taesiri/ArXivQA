# [Reliable Spatial-Temporal Voxels For Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain using complementary multi-modal inputs (e.g. images and LiDAR point clouds) in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods rely on noisy single-frame predictions for adaptation, leading to temporally inconsistent predictions. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes "Latte", an MM-TTA method for multi-modal 3D segmentation that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences to improve optimization stability and prediction consistency. 

Specifically, Latte utilizes a slide window to aggregate consecutive frames and establishes spatial-temporal (ST) voxels that capture local prediction consistency over time. By computing ST entropy for each voxel, unreliable voxels can be filtered out. The remaining reliable ST voxels are used to guide adaptive cross-modal attending, which suppresses noisy modality predictions and stabilizes optimization.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the first MM-TTA method that incorporates spatial-temporal information by establishing reliable ST voxels and ST entropy.
- Introduces adaptive cross-modal attending based on ST entropy to suppress noisy modality predictions.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on 3 MM-TTA benchmarks, with over 5.3% average improvement.
- Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and robustness to hyperparameters.

In summary, Latte achieves more reliable and consistent predictions for online MM-TTA by effectively utilizing spatial-temporal correlations to evaluate and improve modality reliability. The introduced concept of ST voxels and entropy is novel and impactful.
