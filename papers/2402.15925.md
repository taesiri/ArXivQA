# [MultiContrievers: Analysis of Dense Retrieval Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15925)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dense retrievers are widely used in QA and other systems, but there has been little analysis of what information is preserved or lost in their compressed vector representations. This is concerning since retrievers aim to provide explainability and provenance.
- There has also been no analysis on how properties of retrievers, like the information they encode, affects performance or social biases.

Methodology:
- Train 25 MultiContriever models initialized from 25 MultiBert seeds to enable analysis across different random initializations.  
- Use information theoretic (MDL) probing to measure extractability of gender and occupation from Wikipedia biography representations.
- Evaluate on 14 retrieval datasets from BEIR to measure performance.
- Create NQ-gender, a subset of NQ annotated for gender to measure gender bias.

Results:
- Both gender and occupation are more extractable from MultiContriever representations compared to MultiBert, but ratio between them decreases. Suggests less reliance on gender shortcuts.  
- Extractability is very sensitive to initialization in MultiBert but regularized in MultiContriever. However, retriever performance varies greatly across seeds. No single best model across datasets.
- On NQ-gender, gender extractability correlates with performance. But no correlation on full datasets like NQ or MSMARCO. Suggests gender useful for some but not most queries. 
- Removing gender information caused performance drop on NQ-gender but gender bias remained. Bias likely stems from corpus or queries, not representations.

Contributions:
- First analysis of information preservation in dense retrievers
- Analysis of variability and bias across retriever seeds
- Causal analysis showing representations not the source of gender bias
- NQ-gender dataset for analyzing gender in QA
- Release suite of models to facilitate further analysis
