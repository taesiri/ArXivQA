# [Shift-ConvNets: Small Convolutional Kernel with Large Kernel Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12736)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent works have shown benefits of using large convolutional kernels in CNNs to achieve better performance, rivalling transformers. However, typical large kernels have limitations like being not hardware-friendly, diminishing returns with increasing size, and lack of sparse attention. 

- The paper aims to achieve effects of large kernels using only small, hardware-friendly convolutions while also introducing sparse attention.

Method: 
- Proposes a "shift-wise" operator that shifts outputs of multiple small standard convolutions to mimic a large kernel. This keeps convolutions hardware-friendly.

- Introduces sparse group convolutions by pruning some shifted convolution connections during training. This creates sparse long-range dependencies in the features, similar to attention in transformers.

- Combines shift-wise operator with techniques like ghost modules and reparameterization to further improve efficiency.

Contributions:
- Shows shift-wise can accurately emulate large kernels like 51x5 kernel, while using only small 5x5 convolutions shifted appropriately. 

- Shift-wise brings 2x savings in computation and parameters compared to methods like SLaK-Net with large kernels.

- Achieves 81.65% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with shift-wise applied ResNet, outperforming SLaK-Net and other CNNs with similar efficiency.

- Reveals a new technique to introduce sparse dependencies in CNNs, creating opportunities to explore sparse attention mechanisms.

In summary, the paper proposes a shift-wise operator to mimic large convolutional kernels using only small and efficient convolutions, while also enabling sparse attention in CNNs. This helps match transformer performance at higher efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a shift-wise operator that uses shifted small convolutional kernels to achieve the effect of large kernels while establishing sparse long-range dependencies, improving CNN performance at lower computational cost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a shift-wise operator that can achieve the effect of large convolution kernels using regular small convolutions combined with shift operations. This makes it more hardware and software efficient compared to directly using large kernels. 

2. The shift-wise operator introduces sparse group convolutions, which establishes sparse long-range dependencies in the feature space. This is similar to the sparse attention in transformers and is more driven by the data compared to manual design.

3. Experiments show that networks using the proposed shift-wise operator can achieve better accuracy than SLaK networks while requiring much fewer computations and parameters. For example, with half the parameters, the shift-wise network achieves higher accuracy than the SLaK-T network trained for 120 epochs on ImageNet.

4. Analysis shows that the proposed operator halves the computational complexity and number of parameters compared to using large kernels directly. Measurements also demonstrate reduced runtime compared to large kernel implementations.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposal of the shift-wise operator that can efficiently mimic large convolutions and establish useful sparse dependencies. This advances CNN performance while keeping high hardware and software efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Shift-wise operator: The proposed operator that uses shift operations on regular small convolutional kernels to achieve effects similar to large kernels. It is more hardware and software efficient.

- Sparse dependencies: The shift-wise operator creates sparse long-range dependencies between features, similar to transformers. This is done by pruning some connections during training.

- Group-shift convolution: The combination of the shift operator and coarse-grained channel pruning to obtain a sparse group convolution that replicates large kernels.

- Focus length/width: Concepts introduced to generalize the kernel dimensions. Focus length can be larger than the feature map. 

- Computational complexity: Analysis showing the shift-wise operator reduces computations by approx. 50% compared to methods like SLaK-net while achieving better accuracy.

- Reparameterization: Using multi-branch convolution groups that are merged during inference. Combined with "ghost" connections to minimize computations.

So in summary, the key ideas are using efficient shift operations to mimic large kernels, introducing sparsity, and reducing computations for hardware/software efficiency.
