# [EthioMT: Parallel Corpus for Low-resource Ethiopian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19365)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most natural language processing (NLP) models perform poorly for low-resource languages due to lack of data. This is an issue for many Ethiopian languages.
- There is a lack of publicly available parallel corpora and benchmark datasets for machine translation (MT) in Ethiopian languages. This makes research difficult. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces EthioMT, a new parallel corpus for 15 low-resource Ethiopian languages paired with English translations.
- It also creates a benchmark dataset by combining existing data for 4 better-resourced Ethiopian languages - Amharic, Afaan Oromo, Tigrinya and Somali.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the first parallel corpus for 15 low-resource Ethiopian languages to enable MT research.
- Introduction of benchmark datasets and results for 4 better-resourced Ethiopian languages.
- Evaluation of the new corpus and benchmark using transformer and fine-tuning approaches to MT. Fine-tuning performed much better.
- The corpus and benchmarks are open-sourced to foster further research into Ethiopian language NLP/MT.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of new data resources to facilitate MT research for under-served Ethiopian languages. Both data and initial benchmark results are provided.
