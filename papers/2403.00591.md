# [Learning Causal Features for Incremental Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00591)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Object detection models are limited to the categories they are trained on and cannot generalize to detect new categories without forgetting the old ones (catastrophic forgetting). 
- Existing incremental object detection methods focus on replaying old samples or distillation from previous models to preserve knowledge. However, they do not analyze the actual features learned.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Incremental Causal Object Detection (ICOD) model that learns causal features rather than data-bias features. 
- Causal features have a reliable relationship with the detection outputs while data-bias features just happen to correlate on the training data.
- The model has a feature decomposer module that separates the original features into causal and data-bias features.
- It is trained to minimize detection loss using causal features and maximize loss using data-bias features via an adversarial learning strategy. This enhances the effectiveness of causal features while suppressing data-bias.

Main Contributions:
- Learning causal features instead of reviewing old data/models for incremental learning. This gives better adaptability to new tasks.
- New training strategy with adversarial learning to suppress data-bias features and enhance causal features.
- Experiments showing state-of-the-art performance on standard ILOD benchmarks as well as on an incremental scene adaptation task.
- Analysis showing the effectiveness of causal features for adaptability and how the method alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

In summary, the key idea is to learn robust generalizable causal features instead of relying on data-biases during training. This enables better incremental learning ability. The adversarial training strategy operationalizes this idea. Experiments demonstrate improved incremental detection capability on both category as well as scene-based tasks.
