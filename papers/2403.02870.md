# [Precise Extraction of Deep Learning Models via Side-Channel Attacks on   Edge/Endpoint Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02870)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Valuable deep learning models are being deployed on edge/endpoint devices, making them vulnerable to model extraction attacks (MEAs). MEAs aim to steal models by training surrogate models.
- Existing MEAs make unrealistic assumptions about having prior knowledge of the victim model's architecture and image dimensions.
- Side-channel attacks (SCAs) can extract such model information by exploiting hardware vulnerabilities, but it's unclear which pieces of information are most valuable to boost MEAs.

Proposed Solution:
- Perform an empirical analysis to understand the relationship between model information exposed by SCA and the effectiveness of subsequent MEA. 
- Evaluate MEAs with different model architectures, datasets, query budgets and attack strategies while varying the image dimension and model architecture information.
- Demonstrate an end-to-end attack extracting image dimensions via SCA first, then performing MEA with the extracted information.

Key Contributions:
- First analysis of the effects of SCA-exposed model information on MEA under different settings.
- Find image dimension is the most essential piece of information to maximize MEA effectiveness.
- Show SCA can accurately estimate image dimensions, and subsequent MEA with estimated dimensions achieves high fidelity, up to 5.8x better than without prior knowledge. 
- Provide guidance for both offensive use of SCA and defensive strategies against MEA - focus efforts on protecting image dimensions.

In summary, the key innovation is demonstrating the potency of combining SCA to extract image dimensions with MEA, and highlighting image dimensions as the most valuable piece of model information. Defensively, image dimensions should be the priority to protect.
