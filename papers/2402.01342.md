# [Training-time Neuron Alignment through Permutation Subspace for   Improving Linear Mode Connectivity and Model Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01342)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) often converge to functionally similar solutions that are scattered across the parameter space. This causes barriers in the linear mode connectivity (LMC) landscape between solutions.
- Overcoming these LMC barriers is important for understanding deep learning dynamics and improving model fusion techniques.
- Previous post-hoc neuron alignment methods using network permutation are costly for large complex models like vision transformers and language models due to the huge number of potential permutations.

Proposed Solution:
- Hypothesize that learning in a shared permutation subspace during training can align neurons and reduce LMC barriers without extra cost. 
- Validate that pruning at initialization, which breaks symmetry, improves LMC but hurts accuracy at high pruning ratios.
- Propose Training-time Neuron Alignment with Partially Fixed Neurons (TNA-PFN) - a simple yet lossless algorithm that uses a partial gradient mask during training to fix some neuron weights.

Contributions:
- Discover neuron alignment problem from perspective of training time and hypothesize permutation subspaces can improve LMC.
- Propose TNA-PFN algorithm and theoretically + empirically validate it reduces LMC barriers across tasks like computer vision, NLP, etc.
- TNA-PFN excels at wide model fusion apps - helps federated learning algorithms FedPFN & FedPNU; boosts model soup for vision transformers and CoLD fusion for language models.
- Overall, first training-time method for overcoming LMC barriers and enabling scalable model fusion.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper proposes a training-time neuron alignment method that partially fixes neuron weights to break permutation symmetry and reduce linear mode connectivity barriers and improve model fusion, with applications in areas like federated learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors discover the neuron alignment problem from the perspective of training time, which provides new insights. They hypothesize that learning in permutation subspaces can reach better linear mode connectivity (LMC).

2. Under this hypothesis, they first find pruning at initialization can improve LMC. Then, they propose a simple yet lossless training-alignment method called TNA-PFN, which is validated both theoretically and empirically in reducing LMC barriers. 

3. TNA-PFN excels in wide model fusion applications. Two TNA-PFN based algorithms, FedPFN and FedPNU, are proposed for federated learning to show its prospects even under heterogeneous datasets. Moreover, TNA-PFN can enhance the generalization of model soup for vision transformers and ColD fusion for pretrained language models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the training-time neuron alignment method TNA-PFN and showcasing its effectiveness in improving linear mode connectivity and facilitating various model fusion applications like federated learning, model soup, and ColD fusion.
