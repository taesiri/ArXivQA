# [All in One: Multi-task Prompting for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01504)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results on various graph analysis tasks. However, their performance relies heavily on sufficient graph annotations/labels, which are often lacking in real-world applications. 
- Pre-training GNNs on easy-to-obtain data can provide useful prior knowledge to relieve the annotation bottleneck. But there is still a gap between pre-training strategies and downstream tasks, limiting model generalization and even causing negative transfer.
- Recently, prompt learning has shown great effectiveness in NLP by reformulating downstream tasks to fit pre-trained models. But prompting graphs is more challenging due to the complex data structure.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel multi-task prompting framework to bridge the gap between graph pre-training and downstream tasks.
- It first unifies the format of language prompts and graph prompts to transfer the idea from NLP to graphs. The graph prompt contains learnable tokens, structures and insertion patterns.
- It then reformulates node and edge tasks into graph-level tasks by constructing induced subgraphs to match common graph pre-training strategies. 
- Further, it introduces meta-learning over multiple graph tasks to learn better prompt initializations for improved multi-task generalization.

Main Contributions:
- Unifies NLP and graph prompts to enable transferring prompting idea from NLP to graphs
- Reforms various graph tasks into graph-level tasks to better match pre-training strategies
- Designs an effective learnable prompt graph with tokens, structures and insertion patterns 
- Uses meta-learning to learn reliable prompts for improved multi-task performance
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the method outperforms baselines on node, edge and graph-level tasks

In summary, the paper pioneers the prompting topic in the graph domain to improve model generalization under limited supervision. The proposed multi-task prompting framework and associated techniques provide an effective way to bridge graph pre-training and various downstream applications.
