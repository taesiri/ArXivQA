## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey on Neural Question Generation: Methods, Applications, and Prospects":

Problem:
Question Generation (QG) aims to automatically generate natural language questions from diverse input sources like knowledge bases, texts, and images. It has many applications such as question answering, intelligent tutoring systems, conversational systems, and fact verification. Recently, neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art results on QG tasks. However, existing surveys focus narrowly on text-based QG using traditional sequence-to-sequence models. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of neural QG models across various input modalities.

Proposed Solution:
The paper systematically categorizes neural QG models into three types:

1. Structured NQG: Generates questions from structured knowledge bases. Models include seq2seq models, graph2seq models and pre-trained models.

2. Unstructured NQG: Focuses on unstructured text and images. Key models utilize seq2seq, graph neural networks, and generative networks.

3. Hybrid NQG: Leverages both structured and unstructured data like images and text. An under-explored area with potential for innovation.

The survey analyzes the architectures, strengths and limitations of models in each category. It also introduces popular QG datasets, evaluation metrics and applications. 

Main Contributions:
- Provides the first comprehensive taxonomy and review of neural question generation across diverse input modalities including knowledge bases, text and images.

- Presents an in-depth analysis of neural network architectures tailored for structured, unstructured and hybrid question generation.

- Discusses datasets, automatic evaluation metrics, and real-world applications of question generation.

- Identifies limitations of existing methods and suggests promising future directions such as proactive, multi-modal and controllable question generation, alongside better automatic evaluation metrics.

In summary, the paper delivers an extensive overview of neural question generation tasks and models while highlighting opportunities for advancing this vital field.
