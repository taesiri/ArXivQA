# [Long-form evaluation of model editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09394)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Current methods for "model editing" - changing the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) - are almost exclusively evaluated by looking at the next few tokens after a prompt. This fails to measure the actual impact on longer, paragraph-length text generated after editing a model.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new evaluation protocol called LEME (Long-form Evaluation of Model Editing) to assess the impact of model editing on longer natural language generation.
- Construct a dataset of "coupled entity prompts" for generating highly related passages from LLMs.
- Develop a survey with likert scale questions and an annotation task to collect human judgements.
- Create automatic measures (e.g classification models) that correlate well with human judgements.

Main Contributions:
- Novel dataset and survey & annotation instruments for evaluating long form text generation quality after model editing
- Automatic metrics that correlate with human ratings
- Analysis showing methods like ROME & MEMIT lead to more "factual drift" 
- Qualitative error analysis revealing issues like entity drift, contradictions, etc.
- Findings that short-form metrics don't correlate well with long-form quality

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of evaluating model editing on longer text generation through new data, human evaluations, and automatic metrics. It provides novel insights into failure modes not captured by existing short-form evaluations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel evaluation protocol called LEME for measuring the impact of model editing techniques on longer, paragraph-length text generation, finding that methods like ROME which perform well on short-term evaluations struggle with factual consistency over longer texts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper consist of:

1) A novel dataset of coupled entity prompts for evaluating the impact of model editing on longer natural language generation.

2) A survey instrument and annotation scheme for assessing the quality of paragraph-length texts generated after model editing. This includes measures for edit consistency, factual consistency, internal consistency, topicality, and naturalness.

3) Automatic metrics using natural language inference models that correlate well with human judgments on the survey and annotations. These are used to benchmark common model editing techniques.

4) An analysis finding that methods like ROME and MEMIT suffer from more factual drift than other techniques, and that there is little relationship between standard short-form model editing evaluations and the long-form metrics introduced in this paper. 

5) A qualitative error analysis illustrating common failure modes like topic drift, entity drift, contradictions, and overscoped changes.

So in summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive benchmark and analysis of model editing techniques on longer natural language generation through new data, evaluation methods, and experiments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Model editing - Techniques for changing or updating the factual knowledge stored in large language models.

- Long-form evaluation (LEME) - A novel evaluation protocol proposed in the paper to measure the impact of model editing on longer, paragraph-length text generation. 

- Edit consistency - Evidence that a factual edit was successfully made in generated text.

- Factual consistency - Whether generated text remains consistent with facts that were true even before an edit. 

- Internal consistency - The degree to which independently generated passages do not contradict themselves or each other after an edit.  

- Topicality - Whether generated passages stay on topic relevant to the edit and prompt.

- Naturalness - The fluency of generated passages.

- Factual drift - When a model edit unintentionally changes more facts than intended, violating locality.

- Coupled entity prompts - A novel dataset created for long-form evaluation, containing prompts about an entity and a related entity.

- Survey ratings - One evaluation approach using human surveys on several long-form quality metrics. 

- Classification - Another evaluation approach of labeling whether passages support or contradict an edit statement.

So in summary, the key focus is on evaluating model editing techniques in long-form text generation settings using both human and automatic evaluations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new evaluation protocol called LEME for evaluating the impact of model editing techniques on long-form text generation. What are some key components of this protocol and how does it aim to capture dimensions that short-form evaluations may miss?

2. The Coupled Entity Prompts dataset was created to generate related paragraph-length texts that could be used to assess consistency in model editing. What is the motivation behind constructing prompts in this coupled manner and what role do the "subject prompt" and "related prompt" play?  

3. The paper evaluated model editing techniques along several dimensions including edit consistency, factual consistency, internal consistency, topicality and naturalness. Can you explain how each of these dimensions was operationalized in the human evaluation survey?

4. Both an annotation task and a rating survey were used to collect human evaluations. What are the differences between these two evaluation instruments and what unique insights does each provide?

5. Automatic rating models were trained to predict human ratings by framing it as a machine reading comprehension task. How were the synthetic ratings generated and what transformer architecture was used for the raters?

6. The paper found very weak correlations between standard short-form metrics and the long-form metrics introduced here. What does this suggest about what dimensions of model editing each type of evaluation is able to capture?

7. What differences were observed between methods like ROME/MEMIT and methods like MEND when evaluated on the long-form generations? What failure modes were unique to ROME/MEMIT?

8. When analyzing performance on counterfactual updates versus factual updates, what differences were observed? What does this suggest about the difficulty of each type of edit?

9. The qualitative error analysis revealed issues like topic drift, entity drift, and internal contradictions. Can you give examples of one or two of these issues from the paper and explain why they occur?

10. One limitation mentioned is that only a single related passage was generated to assess consistency. What are some ways the consistency analysis could be expanded to better measure the scope of impact from an edit?
