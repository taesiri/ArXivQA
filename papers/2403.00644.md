# [Diff-Plugin: Revitalizing Details for Diffusion-based Low-level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00644)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Diff-Plugin: Revitalizing Details for Diffusion-based Low-level Tasks":

Problem:
- Diffusion models trained on large datasets have shown remarkable progress in image synthesis. However, due to the inherent randomness in the diffusion process, they often struggle to handle diverse low-level vision tasks that require preservation of details.

- Existing methods either rely on unstable inversion strategies or train separate models for each task, limiting their flexibility. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Diff-Plugin", a framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to perform well on various low-level tasks without compromising its original capabilities.

- It consists of two main components: 

1) Task-Plugin Module: A lightweight dual-branch module that extracts task-specific priors - a) Task-Prompt Branch provides high-level guidance, b) Spatial Complement Branch enhances spatial details preservation.

2) Plugin-Selector: Automatically selects appropriate Task-Plugin based on user's text input, allowing switching between plugins.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to augment pre-trained diffusion models for diverse low-level tasks while retaining core competencies 

- Lightweight Task-Plugin with dual-branch design to incorporate task priors for high-fidelity and details-preserving results

- Plugin-Selector for intuitive text-driven plugin scheduling and switching between tasks

- Extensive experiments on 8 tasks showing superior performance over existing diffusion and regression based methods

- Versatile applications like multi-task combinations and generating special effects

In summary, Diff-Plugin enhances pre-trained diffusion models for better low-level vision tasks through modular plugin extensions, without needing specialized training. The dual design of Task-Plugin and text-based Plugin-Selector make it flexible and easy to use.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Diff-Plugin, a novel framework that enables injecting lightweight task-specific modules (Task-Plugins) into pre-trained diffusion models to perform various low-level vision tasks while preserving details, and allows users to select appropriate plugins via text instructions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents Diff-Plugin, the first framework to enable a pre-trained diffusion model to perform various low-level vision tasks while maintaining the original generative abilities.

2. It proposes a Task-Plugin, a lightweight dual-branch module designed for injecting task-specific priors into the diffusion process, to enhance the fidelity of the results.

3. It proposes a Plugin-Selector to select the appropriate Task-Plugin based on the text provided by the user. This extends to a new application that can allow users to edit images via text instructions for low-level vision tasks. 

4. It conducts extensive experiments on eight tasks, demonstrating the competitive performances of Diff-Plugin over existing diffusion and regression-based methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the Diff-Plugin framework to equip pre-trained diffusion models with the ability to handle a variety of low-level vision tasks through lightweight task-specific plugins, while maintaining high-fidelity image content. The Plugin-Selector further enables intuitive text-based control over the framework.

- Content preservation/fidelity: A key capability and evaluation criteria for Diff-Plugin - being able to perform low-level tasks while preserving the content details accurately. 

- Text-driven task scheduling: Another key feature enabled by the proposed Plugin-Selector, allowing users to choose desired Task-Plugins via textual commands.

- Diffusion models: The base generative models that Diff-Plugin builds upon, including stable diffusion. The goal is to enhance their capability in low-level vision tasks.

- Real-world scenarios: Diff-Plugin is evaluated extensively on real-world benchmark datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness for practical applications.

In summary, the key focus areas are around enhancing diffusion models for low-level vision tasks, with emphasis on content fidelity and flexible text-driven scheduling. The proposed Task-Plugin and Plugin-Selector are core technical contributions.
