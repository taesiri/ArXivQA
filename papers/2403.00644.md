# [Diff-Plugin: Revitalizing Details for Diffusion-based Low-level Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00644)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Diff-Plugin: Revitalizing Details for Diffusion-based Low-level Tasks":

Problem:
- Diffusion models trained on large datasets have shown remarkable progress in image synthesis. However, due to the inherent randomness in the diffusion process, they often struggle to handle diverse low-level vision tasks that require preservation of details.

- Existing methods either rely on unstable inversion strategies or train separate models for each task, limiting their flexibility. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Diff-Plugin", a framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to perform well on various low-level tasks without compromising its original capabilities.

- It consists of two main components: 

1) Task-Plugin Module: A lightweight dual-branch module that extracts task-specific priors - a) Task-Prompt Branch provides high-level guidance, b) Spatial Complement Branch enhances spatial details preservation.

2) Plugin-Selector: Automatically selects appropriate Task-Plugin based on user's text input, allowing switching between plugins.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to augment pre-trained diffusion models for diverse low-level tasks while retaining core competencies 

- Lightweight Task-Plugin with dual-branch design to incorporate task priors for high-fidelity and details-preserving results

- Plugin-Selector for intuitive text-driven plugin scheduling and switching between tasks

- Extensive experiments on 8 tasks showing superior performance over existing diffusion and regression based methods

- Versatile applications like multi-task combinations and generating special effects

In summary, Diff-Plugin enhances pre-trained diffusion models for better low-level vision tasks through modular plugin extensions, without needing specialized training. The dual design of Task-Plugin and text-based Plugin-Selector make it flexible and easy to use.
