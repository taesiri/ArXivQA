# Automatic Text-based Personality Recognition on Monologues and   Multiparty Dialogues Using Attentive Networks and Contextual Embeddings

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve automatic personality recognition from text by using attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings, as well as by creating a new dialogue-based dataset?Specifically, the paper aims to address two main issues:1) Previous work has not explored using attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings like BERT and RoBERTa for automatic personality recognition. 2) There are no existing dialogue-based datasets for personality recognition research.To tackle these issues, the paper introduces attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings to the task of personality recognition, demonstrating improved results on the benchmark Essays dataset. The paper also creates a new dialogue-based personality dataset called FriendsPersona using a novel extraction algorithm.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings can improve personality recognition performance, and that creating a dialogue-based dataset will enable new research on modeling personality in conversational contexts. The results on the two datasets support these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Creating a new dialogue dataset called FriendsPersona for automatic personality recognition. The authors developed a novel dialogue extraction algorithm called MainSpeakerFinder (MSF) to extract sub-scenes from full scenes in the Friends TV show and annotate them with personality traits. 2. Introducing attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings (BERT and RoBERTa) for automatic personality recognition from text. The authors show these models achieve new state-of-the-art results on the benchmark Essays dataset, improving accuracy by 2.49% on average across the Big Five traits. 3. Establishing strong baseline results on the new FriendsPersona dialogue dataset using the proposed models. The authors experiment with different ways of representing the dialogue context and show the challenges of modeling personality in multi-party conversations compared to monologues.In summary, the main contributions are creating a new dialogue dataset for personality recognition, and advancing the state-of-the-art for this task by applying recent neural network architectures like BERT and attentive networks. The authors demonstrate the utility of these techniques on both monologue and dialogue data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper presents a new dialogue dataset for personality detection and shows that attentive neural networks with contextual word embeddings improve performance on personality detection in both monologues and dialogues.
