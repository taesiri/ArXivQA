# [Automatic Text-based Personality Recognition on Monologues and   Multiparty Dialogues Using Attentive Networks and Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we improve automatic personality recognition from text by using attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings, as well as by creating a new dialogue-based dataset?

Specifically, the paper aims to address two main issues:

1) Previous work has not explored using attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings like BERT and RoBERTa for automatic personality recognition. 

2) There are no existing dialogue-based datasets for personality recognition research.

To tackle these issues, the paper introduces attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings to the task of personality recognition, demonstrating improved results on the benchmark Essays dataset. The paper also creates a new dialogue-based personality dataset called FriendsPersona using a novel extraction algorithm.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings can improve personality recognition performance, and that creating a dialogue-based dataset will enable new research on modeling personality in conversational contexts. The results on the two datasets support these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Creating a new dialogue dataset called FriendsPersona for automatic personality recognition. The authors developed a novel dialogue extraction algorithm called MainSpeakerFinder (MSF) to extract sub-scenes from full scenes in the Friends TV show and annotate them with personality traits. 

2. Introducing attentive neural networks and contextual embeddings (BERT and RoBERTa) for automatic personality recognition from text. The authors show these models achieve new state-of-the-art results on the benchmark Essays dataset, improving accuracy by 2.49% on average across the Big Five traits. 

3. Establishing strong baseline results on the new FriendsPersona dialogue dataset using the proposed models. The authors experiment with different ways of representing the dialogue context and show the challenges of modeling personality in multi-party conversations compared to monologues.

In summary, the main contributions are creating a new dialogue dataset for personality recognition, and advancing the state-of-the-art for this task by applying recent neural network architectures like BERT and attentive networks. The authors demonstrate the utility of these techniques on both monologue and dialogue data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper presents a new dialogue dataset for personality detection and shows that attentive neural networks with contextual word embeddings improve performance on personality detection in both monologues and dialogues.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in automatic personality recognition:

- Dataset: This paper introduces a new dialogue-based dataset, FriendsPersona, for personality recognition. Previous datasets like Essays were monologue-based. Creating a dialogue dataset advances the field into a new genre.

- Models: The authors use neural networks with attention mechanisms (ABLSTM, ABCNN) as well as BERT and RoBERTa contextual embeddings. Most prior work used traditional machine learning models and static word embeddings. Using these more advanced NLP techniques represents the state-of-the-art.

- Performance: The models in this paper achieve new state-of-the-art results on the Essays benchmark, improving accuracy by 2.49% on average across the five personality traits. This demonstrates these methods advance the overall field.

- Dialogue: A key contribution is analyzing personality recognition in dialogue, whereas most prior work looked at monologues like essays. The authors demonstrate challenges in modeling personality based on multiparty conversations in FriendsPersona.

- Generalizability: The authors test their models on both Essays and FriendsPersona. Showing improved performance on both datasets demonstrates the robustness and generalizability of the approaches.

Overall, this paper pushes personality recognition forward by creating a new dialogue dataset, applying latest NLP techniques, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and analyzing the nuances of modeling personality in dialogue. It represents significant advances to the field's resources, techniques, and understanding.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Designing a customized model to better leverage dialogue information between speakers in personality recognition. The current models like HAN can attend to the main speaker's utterances but do not fully utilize the contextual dialogue.

- Developing a BERT-based attention network to model utterances in dialogue more effectively. This could help improve performance on the FriendsPersona dialogue dataset created in this work.

- Improving the annotation quality and expanding the size of the FriendsPersona dataset through assigning more annotators. This could provide more training data and help build better models. 

- Exploring multimodal data (text, audio, video) for personality recognition, as the authors mention the subjectivity and limitations of purely text-based annotation. Multimodal data could provide more cues and achieve higher inter-annotator agreement.

In summary, the main suggested future work is developing better dialogue-based models, improving the FriendsPersona dataset quality and size, and exploring multimodal data for personality recognition. The authors lay out promising research directions to advance personality recognition in conversational settings.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new dialogue dataset called FriendsPersona for personality recognition as well as novel models using attentive networks and contextual embeddings. Previous work on automatic personality recognition from text focused on using traditional classification models with linguistic features on monologue essays. This paper has two main contributions. First, the authors create the first dialogue dataset for personality recognition by extracting and annotating conversations from the TV show Friends using a novel extraction algorithm called MainSpeakerFinder. This algorithm breaks down full scenes into smaller sub-scenes focused on one main speaker to make annotation easier. The new FriendsPersona dataset contains 711 conversations annotated for Big Five personality traits. 

Second, the authors present new models using attentive neural networks like attention-based CNN/LSTM and hierarchical attention networks along with contextual embeddings from BERT and RoBERTa. They experiment on both the benchmark Essays dataset and their new FriendsPersona dataset. The models with BERT and RoBERTa embeddings improve state-of-the-art accuracy on Essays by 2.49% on average across traits. On FriendsPersona, they test feeding the dialogue text in different formats and find the models perform best when only the target speaker's utterances are used, converting the dialogue to a monologue. The results demonstrate the challenges of modeling personality in multi-party dialogues and the need for customized models that can leverage conversational context. Overall, the paper makes solid contributions in creating a new dialogue dataset for personality recognition and pushing model performance on monologues using the latest neural techniques.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a novel approach to automatic personality recognition from text using pre-trained contextual embeddings (BERT and RoBERTa) and attentive neural networks. The authors first created a new dialogue dataset called FriendsPersona by extracting and annotating conversations from the Friends TV show using their MainSpeakerFinder algorithm. They then experimented with different neural network architectures like CNNs, LSTMs, and attention networks using contextual embeddings from BERT and RoBERTa to classify personality traits on the benchmark Essays dataset and their new FriendsPersona dataset. Their best models utilizing RoBERTa embeddings and attentive networks substantially improved upon previous benchmarks on the Essays monologue dataset. The authors also established strong baselines on their new FriendsPersona dialogue dataset and analyzed the challenges of modeling personality in multiparty conversations. Overall, the key innovation was using state-of-the-art contextual embeddings and attentive networks for automatic personality recognition, evaluated on both existing monologue data and newly created dialogue data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problems/questions it is addressing are:

1. Previous work on automatic personality recognition from text has focused on using traditional machine learning models with handcrafted linguistic features, but neural network models with contextual embeddings have not been explored much for this task. 

2. There are no existing dialogue datasets annotated with personality traits that can be used to study personality recognition in conversations as opposed to monologue text.

3. It is an open question how well existing models for personality recognition on monologues will perform on conversational dialogue data, which has additional complexities like multiple speakers.

4. Whether using contextual embeddings like BERT and RoBERTa along with attentive neural network architectures can improve performance over previous models on personality recognition from text.

5. How to create a annotated dialogue dataset for personality recognition in a scalable way.

So in summary, the main focus is on applying more modern neural network methods to personality recognition, creating a new dialogue dataset for this task, and analyzing how well existing models transfer from monologues to conversations for this problem.
