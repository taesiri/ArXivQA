# [Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion of Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement with   Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05808)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing blind image super-resolution methods have two main limitations:
1) They typically estimate a single spatially invariant blur kernel for the entire image, which is inaccurate for real-world degradetions which vary across the image.  
2) Diffusion model based methods fail to properly constrain the diffusion process with degradation information, leading to results that deviate from reality.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a framework called "Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion of Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement with Diffusion Model for Blind Image Super-Resolution (SSR)". The key ideas are:

1) Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement (SVKR) module to estimate a depth-informed spatially variant blur kernel instead of a single kernel. This better models real degradations. SVKR also iteratively refines the depth map and kernel estimates.

2) Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion (AMF) module to encode and align features from the LR image, depth map and blur kernel using encoders of different scales. This fuses the multimodal information to constrain the diffusion model.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposal of a SSR framework for blind SR that uses spatially variant kernels and multimodal fusion to constrain the diffusion model.

2) A Spatially Variant Kernel Refinement module to iteratively estimate depth-informed spatially variant blur kernels.

3) An Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion module to encode and align multimodal features to guide the diffusion model.

4) State-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative performance on benchmark datasets compared to existing blind SR methods. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of the proposed modules.

In summary, this paper presents a novel approach to address key limitations of existing blind super-resolution methods by using depth-informed spatially variant kernels and adaptive multimodal fusion to constrain the diffusion model. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate superior performance.
