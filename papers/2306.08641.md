# [Towards AGI in Computer Vision: Lessons Learned from GPT and Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08641)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

What are the lessons learned from recent progress in natural language processing with large language models, particularly GPT, that could help advance computer vision towards artificial general intelligence?

The key points are:

- GPT and large language models have shown promising progress towards AGI in NLP through abilities like multitask learning and few-shot learning. 

- Computer vision has seen efforts towards unification across tasks, but is far from a system like GPT. 

- The key difference is NLP has established the text "world" through the chat/dialog task, allowing interaction and learning. CV lacks such environments.

- The paper proposes an imaginary pipeline with 3 stages: establishing interactive environments, generative pre-training for world modeling, and instruct fine-tuning for tasks. 

- This is envisioned to allow CV models to learn from interaction and accomplish real-world visual tasks, moving towards AGI.

In summary, the paper aims to absorb lessons from progress in NLP to outline a potential path towards AGI in computer vision, based on learning in interactive environments. The central hypothesis is that this paradigm will allow more capable and general CV models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides an analysis of the current status and recent progress towards unification in computer vision (CV), including efforts in open-world recognition, the Segment Anything task, generalized visual encoding, LLM-guided understanding, and multimodal dialog. 

2. It identifies the key difference between natural language processing (NLP) and CV that has made unification more challenging in CV - the lack of interactable environments for agents to learn from, compared to the natural text environment in NLP.

3. It proposes an imaginary pipeline for training stronger CV agents that involves first establishing high-quality 3D embodied environments, then generatively pre-training agents to explore and predict future frames based on their actions, and finally instruct fine-tuning the agents on real world tasks.  

4. It reviews existing works related to parts of this pipeline, such as efforts in environment simulation, visual pre-training, reinforcement learning for games, and embodied CV.

5. It provides perspectives on future research directions to realize this pipeline, including establishing more abundant and higher-fidelity environments, designing pre-training objectives focused on data compression, collecting large-scale human instructions for fine-tuning, and unifying tasks into a prompting system.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying the weakness of current CV research as lacking interactable environments for learning, proposing a learning pipeline to address this, and outlining research directions to realize such an approach towards artificial general intelligence in computer vision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes why computer vision lags behind natural language processing in achieving artificial general intelligence, pointing to the lack of interactive environments for pre-training as the key issue, and proposes a pipeline involving establishing environments, pre-training agents to explore and predict frames, and fine-tuning with human instructions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on achieving AGI in computer vision:

- The paper provides a nice conceptual overview of AGI and the progress made in NLP, helping frame the challenges in achieving AGI for CV. Many other papers in this space focus more narrowly on technical details without providing this broader context. 

- In reviewing recent efforts towards unification in CV, the paper categorizes and succinctly summarizes work across diverse topics like open-world recognition, universal visual representations, LLM-based methods, and dialog. This provides useful synthesis and structure to a rapidly evolving research landscape.

- The analysis on the limitations of proxy tasks and the lack of learning from environments provides an insightful critique on the status quo in CV research. The paper makes a compelling case for the need to establish interactive environments and pre-train generatively on agent-environment interactions.

- The proposed conceptual pipeline for future CV research seems promising for making progress towards AGI. While related ideas have been explored in domains like embodied AI and robotics, the paper provides a thoughtful discussion on how CV research needs to embrace such paradigms more fully.

- Compared to some other conceptual/opinion papers on this topic, this paper grounds its perspectives in detailed analysis of existing work and draws substantively from progress in NLP via models like GPT. The imagined pipeline and directions seem actionable.

In summary, I think this paper makes a valuable contribution in providing cross-disciplinary context, thoughtful critiques, and a constructive vision to work towards AGI in CV. The comparative analysis and proposes future directions help advance the discourse in this emerging field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

1. Continuing to improve 3D virtual environments for CV by increasing their scale, diversity, and fidelity. This includes exploring new 3D representations like NeRF and enriching environments through better simulation of other agents' behaviors. 

2. Designing new pre-training tasks focused on efficient exploration and data compression in embodied environments, rather than existing proxies like contrastive learning or masked image modeling. This will guide architecture design to enable extracting features at different granularities. 

3. Defining new elementary embodied tasks like exploration and interaction, then collecting abundant human instructions to compose complex real-world tasks via prompting systems. The amount of instruction data needs to be much larger than in NLP.

4. Developing generalized tokenization and prompting systems to support composing complex multimodal tasks and generating cross-modal data like text-to-image.

5. Reducing the focus on incremental improvements to proxy tasks, which can impede progress towards real-world AGI. Instead evaluating on embodied tasks and multimodal generation should become the norm.

In summary, the key shifts suggested are: focusing less on proxy tasks, establishing more interactive environments, designing pre-training for exploration and compression, collecting more human instructions, and evaluating multimodal generation ability. The authors see significant technical evolution as needed to realize this paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper discusses how to advance computer vision (CV) algorithms towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). It reviews recent efforts in CV for task unification, including open-world recognition, the Segment Anything task, generalized visual encoding, LLM-guided understanding, and multimodal dialog. However, CV still lacks a learning paradigm based on interacting with environments, which is key for natural language processing models like GPT. The authors propose an imaginary pipeline with 3 stages: establishing high-quality embodied environments, generative pre-training models to predict future frames based on actions, and instruct fine-tuning on real-world tasks. Substantial research is still needed to realize this pipeline. Overall, the paper provides perspectives on moving CV beyond optimizing proxy tasks towards an algorithm that can learn a wide range of real-world skills via interaction.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper discusses how to advance computer vision (CV) algorithms towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). The authors first review recent efforts towards unifying different CV tasks into one system, including open-world recognition, the Segment Anything task, generalized visual encoding, LLM-guided understanding, and multimodal dialog. However, the authors argue that CV still lacks a key paradigm that enabled progress in natural language processing: learning from interactive environments. The authors propose an imaginary pipeline with three stages: establishing high-quality virtual environments, generative pre-training an agent to explore and predict in these environments, and instruct fine-tuning the agent to accomplish real-world tasks. Existing works related to parts of this pipeline are discussed. Finally, the authors provide perspectives on future research directions to realize this pipeline, including establishing more diverse and complex environments, designing pre-training objectives for efficient data compression, collecting abundant human instructions for complex real-world tasks, and prompting the fine-tuned agent for conventional CV tasks. Overall, the authors advocate moving away from optimizing proxy tasks common in current CV research, towards a paradigm focused on embodied agents learning broad skills by interacting with virtual environments.

In summary, this paper analyzes the difficulty in achieving AGI for computer vision compared to natural language processing. The key insight is that NLP has benefited from pre-training large models on massive text corpora, which creates an interactive environment to learn general skills. The authors propose establishing interactive virtual environments for CV, pre-training embodied agents in these environments, and instructing the agents for real-world tasks. They discuss related works and provide perspectives on research directions to realize this vision of moving from optimizing proxy tasks to learning from interaction. The end goal is developing CV systems with more generalized intelligence.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an imaginary pipeline for training computer vision algorithms to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI). The pipeline has three main stages: 1) Establishing high-quality 3D embodied environments that are abundant, realistic, and support rich interaction; 2) Generative pre-training where the algorithm explores the environments and is trained to predict future frames based on its actions; 3) Instruct fine-tuning where the pre-trained model is guided by human instructions to accomplish real-world tasks. The pipeline is inspired by large language models like GPT which are first pre-trained on large text corpora and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Similarly, the hope is that pre-training on interactive environments followed by instruction-based fine-tuning will produce computer vision systems capable of general intelligence across a wide variety of real-world visual tasks. The paper argues this is needed because existing computer vision methods based on supervised training on static datasets are reaching diminishing returns and becoming increasingly disconnected from real AGI.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of advancing computer vision algorithms towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). Specifically, it aims to understand why AGI has been achieved in natural language processing (NLP) through models like GPT, but not yet in computer vision (CV), and explore potential ways forward inspired by the progress in NLP.

The key questions the paper tries to answer are:

1) Why is unification of tasks so difficult in CV compared to NLP? 

2) What can we learn from GPT and large language models (LLMs) to make progress towards AGI in CV?

3) How can we establish a new learning paradigm for CV that allows algorithms to learn from environments and interactions, like what happened with GPT in NLP?

The paper reviews recent efforts towards unification in CV, including open-world recognition, generalized encoding, LLM-guided understanding, and multimodal dialog. It argues these are still far from a unified system like GPT. It points out CV lacks a way for algorithms to learn from environments through interaction. The paper proposes an imaginary pipeline for CV involving: establishing environments, generative pre-training, and instruct fine-tuning. It suggests substantial research is needed to realize this vision.

In summary, the key focus is understanding obstacles to AGI in CV and charting a potential path forward inspired by progress in NLP. Establishing embodied environments and new pre-training paradigms are highlighted as critical next steps.
