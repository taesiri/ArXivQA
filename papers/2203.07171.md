# [Orchestrated Value Mapping for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07171)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we develop a general class of reinforcement learning algorithms that can enhance learning by mapping value estimates to different spaces and decomposing rewards into multiple channels?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Mapping value estimates to different spaces using a broad class of functions can allow incorporating useful properties like handling varying reward scales. 2) Decomposing rewards into multiple channels can help deal with highly varying rewards, incorporate prior knowledge about reward sources, and enable ensemble learning.3) Combining these two principles of value mapping and reward decomposition provides a general blueprint for constructing new reinforcement learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. 4) Algorithms instantiated from this framework can outperform existing algorithms like Q-learning on challenging domains by leveraging the benefits of value mapping and reward decomposition.So in summary, the central research direction seems to be developing a theoretical framework to systematically construct new RL algorithms using value mapping and reward decomposition, with the hypothesis that algorithms derived from this framework will perform better on complex RL problems. The paper aims to formally present this framework, prove convergence, and provide some initial algorithmic examples and validation.
