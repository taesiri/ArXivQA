# [Adinkra Symbol Recognition using Classical Machine Learning and Deep   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15728)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a new dataset called ADINKRA for classifying and recognizing cultural Adinkra symbols from Ghana. The dataset contains over 174,000 images categorized into 62 distinct classes representing unique symbols. The authors developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model inspired by VGG for image classification, using 6 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. They also employed transfer learning by leveraging pretrained VGG and ResNet models. The models are evaluated on classification accuracy, convergence, and visualization of influential areas. The CNN model achieved 97.29% accuracy on the test set. ResNet obtained the highest accuracy at 97.94\%, demonstrating the power of transfer learning. The models generalize well, reflecting the diversity and quality of the Adinkra dataset. By tackling this culturally-relevant task, the authors aim to make AI more accessible and applicable for preserving cultural heritage. The comprehensive evaluations establish a strong benchmark for future assessments of the dataset.
