# [MunTTS: A Text-to-Speech System for Mundari](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15579)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many languages spoken in India are low-resource and at risk of becoming extinct. This leads to loss of cultural heritage. 
- Building speech technologies like text-to-speech (TTS) systems can help preserve and promote such languages. But building TTS systems for low-resource languages has challenges like lack of training data, expert input, native speakers for evaluation etc.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors build a TTS system called MunTTS for Mundari, a low-resource Austro-Asiatic language spoken by about 1 million people in India.
- They collect a Mundari speech dataset of 26,868 recordings from 2 speakers (74% female, 26% male), consisting of 27.51 hours of audio.
- They train end-to-end TTS models - VITS-22K, VITS-44K and fine-tune XTTS v2 model.
- Evaluate models using Mean Opinion Score (MOS) from native speakers and Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD).

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the first high-quality, multi-speaker Mundari speech corpus.
- Development of end-to-end TTS models for an extremely low-resource language. 
- Analysis of performance of models - VITS-44K gets best MOS of 3.69, closest to real speech.
- Public release of models to benefit Mundari language community.
- Showcase a case-study of developing speech technology for a low-resource language through community partnership.

The summary covers the key aspects - problem, proposed solution, models trained, evaluations done, and main contributions regarding the development of a TTS system for the low-resource Mundari language.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents MunTTS, an end-to-end text-to-speech system for Mundari, a low-resource Indian language, trained on a collected dataset of 26,868 audio recordings which is evaluated to achieve a mean opinion score of 3.69.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contribution is the development of MunTTS, an end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) system specifically for Mundari, a low-resource Indian language. Specifically:

1) The authors collected a substantial dataset of Mundari text and speech, consisting of 15,656 unique sentences and 26,868 high-quality audio recordings totaling 27.51 hours. 

2) Using this dataset, they trained end-to-end TTS models, including VITS and finetuned XTTS v2, to synthesize natural sounding Mundari speech.

3) They evaluated the TTS systems with native speakers using mean opinion score (MOS) and objective metrics. The VITS model with 44KHz sampling rate achieved the best MOS of 3.69, closest to the human speech baseline.

4) The authors analyzed the challenges of building TTS for low-resource languages and shared their experiences in collecting data and training models to extract the most from limited resources. 

In summary, the main contribution is the development and evaluation of the first dedicated high-quality TTS system for the extremely low-resource Mundari language, including the publishing of the speech dataset and models to benefit preservation and promotion of the language.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Mundari - The low-resource Indian language that is the focus of the text-to-speech system developed in the paper. It is an Austro-Asiatic language spoken by about 1 million people.

- Text-to-speech (TTS) - The paper develops a TTS system specifically for the Mundari language. This is the core technology and application area.

- Low-resource language - The paper addresses challenges with building linguistic technologies like TTS for languages with limited resources like Mundari.

- End-to-end models - The TTS systems explored are end-to-end neural network models like VITS and XTTS v2 rather than traditional multi-stage pipelines.

- Speech synthesis - The paper deals with synthesizing artificial speech from input text, a sub-field of speech processing and AI.

- Subjective/objective evaluation - Both human ratings (subjective) and automated metrics (objective) are used to evaluate the TTS systems.

- Mean Opinion Score (MOS) - A standard subjective evaluation metric based on 1-5 ratings of speech naturalness.

- Mel-Cepstral Distortion (MCD) - An objective metric used to compare the spectral characteristics between real and synthesized speech.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a Hindi corpus of 100,000 sentences which was translated to Mundari. What considerations should be kept in mind while translating from a high-resource language like Hindi to a low-resource language like Mundari to ensure high quality parallel data?

2. The paper uses a recording studio setup for collecting high quality speech data. What are some alternative approaches for collecting speech data in a low-resource setting where access to studios may be limited? How can quality be ensured in such settings?

3. The sampling rate used for recordings in this paper is 44.1KHz. What are the tradeoffs between using high sampling rates versus lower sampling rates like 22KHz from a speech synthesis perspective?

4. The paper trains VITS models at both 44.1KHz and 22KHz. What motivates this comparison and what differences would you expect in the quality and computational requirements of the two models? 

5. What acoustic and linguistic factors need to be considered when collecting speech data to ensure phonetically balanced and representative coverage for a low-resource language like Mundari?

6. The paper uses a speaker-weighted sampler to handle imbalance between male and female speakers. What other techniques could be used to mitigate such imbalances? What impact might the imbalance have on synthesis quality?

7. The paper observes degraded performance when fine-tuning the XTTS v2 model on Mundari data. What factors might explain this behavior and how can it be avoided?

8. What objective and subjective evaluation metrics beyond MOS and MCD should be considered for low-resource TTS to capture additional aspects of synthesis quality?

9. The paper uses VITS architecture for TTS which combines VAEs and GANs. What are the benefits of this over other end-to-end TTS architectures? What hyperparameters need tuning for stability and convergence when training VITS?

10. The paper releases recordings and models publicly to promote work on low-resource languages. What ethical considerations need to kept in mind when publicly releasing such resources?
