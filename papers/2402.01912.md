# [Natural language guidance of high-fidelity text-to-speech with synthetic   annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01912)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models rely on reference audio for control of speaker identity and style, limiting creative applications. Using natural language for control shows promise, but current approaches rely on small datasets with human annotations, preventing scaling.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose automatic labeling method to add metadata (gender, accent, pitch, speaking rate, recording quality) to 45k hours of speech data.
- Train a conditional autoregressive speech model on this data using transcript and text descriptions as input.
- Model the latent space of recording/channel conditions using a small high-fidelity subset of training data.
- Use state-of-the-art audio codec model to achieve high fidelity synthesis.

Contributions:
- First work to scale natural language conditioned speech synthesis to tens of thousands of hours and rely solely on automatic labeling.
- Control a diverse range of accents, styles, and channel conditions in one model using intuitive text descriptions. 
- Significantly outperform recent work in audio fidelity and match between description and synthesis, despite using only found data.
- Demonstrate that with 1% high-fidelity data and latest codecs, high-fidelity synthesis is possible even when rest of training data is noisy and reverberant.

In summary, this work pushes the boundary of controllable and creative speech synthesis by proposing automatic labeling techniques to scale conditioning on text descriptions to tens of thousands of hours for the first time. The result is a single model capable of high-fidelity and natural speech synthesis in a wide range of styles and conditions using intuitive text prompts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The authors propose a scalable method to automatically label a diverse 45k hour speech dataset with speaker attributes and use this data to train a text-to-speech model that can generate high-fidelity and natural sounding speech conditioned on intuitive natural language descriptions of speaker identity, style, accent, and recording conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a method for efficiently labeling a 45k hour dataset with multiple attributes, including gender, accent, speaking rate, pitch, and recording conditions. 

2. Training a speech language model on this dataset and demonstrating the ability to control these attributes independently, creating speaker identities and style combinations unseen in the training data.

3. Demonstrating that with as little as 1% high-fidelity audio in the training data and using the latest audio codec models, it is possible to generate extremely high-fidelity audio. 

In summary, the main contribution is a scalable method for intuitive control over various aspects of speech through natural language descriptions, while also achieving very high audio quality. This is enabled by automatically labeling a large dataset and leveraging recent advances in neural audio codecs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Text-to-speech (TTS)
- Natural language conditioning
- Speaker identity
- Speaking style 
- High-fidelity audio
- Audio codecs (Encodec, Descript Audio Codec)
- Accent classification 
- Metadata labeling (gender, accent, pitch, speaking rate, SNR, reverberation)
- Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS)
- LibriTTS
- AudioCraft library

The paper proposes a scalable method for labeling speech datasets with metadata related to speaker identity, style, and recording conditions. It then trains a large-scale speech language model conditioned on textual descriptions to control these attributes and generate high-quality speech. Key capabilities include intuitive control over accent, prosody, channel conditions, etc. using natural language. The model is trained on MLS (45k hours) and a subset of clean data from LibriTTS. Overall, the key focus is on high-fidelity controllable TTS using automatic metadata creation and conditioning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a method to label speech datasets with multiple attributes like gender, accent, pitch etc. What are some of the major challenges in automatically labeling large speech datasets with semantic attributes? How well does the proposed method address these challenges?

2. The paper uses an accent classifier to label accents in the dataset. What are some of the limitations of using discrete labels for accents? How can the accent labeling be improved to better capture the continuous nature of accents? 

3. The paper demonstrates controlling attributes like pitch and speaking rate using natural language descriptions. However, controlling the style and emotion of synthesized speech using descriptions remains an open challenge. What modifications can be made to the proposed method to achieve better control over speaking style and emotion?

4. The paper shows the ability to generate high fidelity speech by using a very small subset of high quality data. What are the factors that enable generating high fidelity speech without needing large amounts of clean data? How can this idea be extended to other speech generation tasks?

5. The proposed model relies entirely on textual descriptions for controlling speaker identity and channel conditions without using any audio reference. What are the advantages and limitations of this approach over using audio references? When would using audio references be more suitable?

6. The paper demonstrates high relevance between input descriptions and synthesized speech. However, some mismatch is observed for certain attributes like accent and C50. What could be the potential reasons behind this mismatch? How can the relevance for these problematic attributes be improved?

7. The model is currently only evaluated on English audiobook speech. What challenges do you foresee in extending this approach to more diverse speech styles and languages? How should the method be adapted to ensure effective control across different use cases?

8. The paper relies on automatic labeling of speech datasets using simple statistical measures. What are some ways the labeling can be enhanced to capture more semantic aspects of speech? What other speech attributes would be useful to control via descriptions? 

9. The results show that audio fidelity impacts subjective evaluation more than relevance to input description. Should future work focus more on further improving audio quality or relevance? What trade-offs need to be considered?

10. The paper demonstrates high quality TTS using simple conditioning mechanisms like prepending and cross-attention. What are some more advanced conditioning mechanisms that can potentially improve controllability and fidelity? How should they be incorporated into the current architecture?
