# [CoBOS: Constraint-Based Online Scheduler for Human-Robot Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18459)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Coordinating humans and robots working together on assembly tasks is challenging due to uncertainties in task durations, human behaviors, and complex task dependencies. 
- Fixed robot programs are inflexible and cause ineffective collaboration. This leads to frustration and lowered productivity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes CoBOS, a novel constraint-based online scheduling approach to adaptively coordinate human-robot collaboration. 
- It incorporates a constraint programming model to allocate and sequence tasks between the human and robot to optimize the schedule. The model is solved repeatedly during execution to adjust the schedules based on real-time observations.
- The approach is integrated into a reactive control framework using behavior trees, which interface the robot and a GUI for the human worker.

Key Contributions:
- CoBOS algorithm that performs online scheduling for human-robot collaboration by optimizing constraints and rescheduling based on real-time observations of progress and delays
- Probabilistic simulation environment to evaluate coordination approaches, simulating task uncertainties and human behaviors
- Extensive comparative evaluation against 3 baseline methods over 7 task types and 56,000 experiments 
- Demonstrated increased productivity and robustness to uncertainties, outperforming baselines, especially for more complex tasks
- Implementation on real robot system as proof of concept

In summary, the paper presents a novel online scheduling technique for coordinating human-robot teamwork on assembly tasks. By optimizing constraints and rescheduling adaptively, it increases the flexibility and efficiency of collaboration despite uncertainties. Rigorous experiments demonstrate significant improvements over alternative approaches.
