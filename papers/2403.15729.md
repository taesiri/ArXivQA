# [Towards a RAG-based Summarization Agent for the Electron-Ion Collider](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15729)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- In large-scale physics experiments like the upcoming Electron Ion Collider (EIC), the huge amount of data and documentation can be overwhelming for new collaborators to comprehend. An AI assistant that can condense information and provide contextualized, trustworthy responses would greatly aid researchers.

Proposed Solution - RAG Agent:
- A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based AI agent called RAGS4EIC is proposed. It leverages a vector database of EIC papers to retrieve relevant contexts and uses a large language model (LLM) to generate summaries. 

- The system has 2 key stages - ingestion and inference. In ingestion, EIC papers are vectorized and stored to enable quick retrieval later. In inference, user questions trigger the LLM to decide if retrieval is needed. If yes, relevant contexts are fetched from the vector DB and used to craft contextualized responses.

Key Contributions:
- Created a specialized RAG agent for the EIC community that can condense information and provide references, reducing hallucinations.

- Implemented an LLM-assisted dataset creation workflow to generate rich training/evaluation datasets without needing expert annotators. 

- Evaluated the RAG agent using standard metrics and RAGAs (RAG assessments), showing high claim recognition and answer correctness along with low hallucination.

- Developed an end-to-end web application demonstrating the full workflow from ingestion to inference as a proof of concept. Overall, demonstrated the feasibility of a RAG agent to aid EIC researchers.

In summary, the paper proposes an AI assistant for the EIC based on RAG that can effectively condense information and provide contextualized, trustworthy summaries to aid researchers. Both the technical solution and web implementation are significant contributions.
