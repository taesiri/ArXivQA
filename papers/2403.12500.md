# [A Large Collection of Model-generated Contradictory Responses for   Consistency-aware Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12500)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating contradictory responses is a major issue for dialogue response generation models. However, there is a lack of large-scale datasets containing model-generated contradictory responses to analyze this problem and train methods to mitigate it.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors build the first large-scale dataset containing over 10,000 model-generated contradictory responses and 17,000 non-contradictory responses.
- The responses are generated by 8 state-of-the-art response generation models to follow-up questions extracted from dialogues to efficiently elicit contradictions. 
- The responses are manually labeled as contradictory or not by 3 human annotators.

Contributions:
- The paper provides an extensive analysis of the characteristics of model-generated contradictions using this new dataset, identifying distinctive types of contradictions models generate.
- It demonstrates that training a contradiction detector on this dataset substantially improves performance in identifying model-generated contradictions compared to training on existing human-written contradiction data.
- The large dataset enables more effective data-driven approaches to analyze and mitigate contradictory responses for dialogue systems.
- This is the first work to construct a dataset with over 1,000 model-generated contradictory responses and highlights the value of collecting contradictions from state-of-the-art models.

In summary, the key innovation is the construction of the first large-scale dataset of model contradictions to better understand and handle this critical dialogue issue. The analysis and experiments clearly showcase the benefits of training on model-specific contradictions.
