# [DiffTAD: Temporal Action Detection with Proposal Denoising Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to formulate temporal action detection (TAD) as a diffusion-based generative modeling task. Specifically, the paper proposes a new TAD model called DiffTAD that treats TAD as a conditional denoising diffusion process that generates accurate action proposals from random/noisy proposals. 

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Formulating TAD as diffusion-based generative modeling, which is a new perspective compared to prior TAD methods based on discriminative learning.

- Designing DiffTAD using a transformer decoder as the denoiser within a single-stage detection framework like DETR. This allows bypassing issues with two-stage pipelines like R-CNN.

- Introducing a temporal location query design and cross-step selective conditioning to enable efficient diffusion-based inference for TAD.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art TAD performance on ActivityNet and THUMOS benchmarks compared to both generative and discriminative baselines.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that reformulating TAD as a conditional denoising diffusion task can achieve strong results by reversing the diffusion process to generate accurate proposals. The key novelty is the diffusion perspective and how it is adapted to TAD using the proposed DiffTAD model.
