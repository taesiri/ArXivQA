# Learning how to explain neural networks: PatternNet and   PatternAttribution

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central hypothesis of this paper is that existing methods for explaining neural network decisions (such as DeConvNet, Guided BackProp and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) do not produce theoretically correct explanations even for simple linear models. The key points are:- The authors analyze how linear models work, showing that the weights of a linear model are primarily determined by canceling out "distractor" components in the input, not by detecting the "signal" component. - They argue that visualizing the weights alone does not reveal the input patterns that are truly relevant for the model's output. Identifying these relevant patterns requires learning from both the model and the data distribution.- They propose new methods called PatternNet and PatternAttribution that learn to estimate the relevant input patterns and use these to produce improved explanations for neural networks.- Experiments show PatternNet and PatternAttribution give superior results compared to existing methods like DeConvNet and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, even on simple linear models where ground truth is known.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that current explanation methods are flawed even for linear models, and the authors propose novel learned explanation techniques that perform better.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing two new methods, PatternNet and PatternAttribution, for explaining and interpreting neural network models. The key ideas are:- Analyzing explanation methods for neural networks in the context of linear models. The authors show that popular approaches like DeConvNet, GuidedBackProp, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) do not provide correct explanations even for simple linear models. - Proposing a new quality measure for evaluating how well an explanation method captures the true "signal" versus "distractor" components in the input data.- Deriving a new signal estimator called PatternAttribution that optimizes this quality measure. It learns to estimate the signal and distractor components. - Using PatternAttribution to propose two new explanation methods:1) PatternNet - Projects the estimated signal back to the input space to visualize what input patterns caused a neuron's activation.2) PatternAttribution - Computes pixel-wise relevance scores by element-wise multiplying the signal estimate with the weight vector. Improves upon LRP.- Showing qualitatively and quantitatively that PatternNet and PatternAttribution produce improved visualizations and heatmaps compared to prior methods.In summary, the main contribution is developing a theoretical framework for evaluating explanation methods on neural networks, and using it to derive two new methods that produce superior explanations.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper analyzes explanation methods for deep neural networks and finds that popular approaches like DeConvNet, GuidedBackProp and LRP fail even for simple linear models; the authors propose new methods called PatternNet and PatternAttribution that provide improved explanations by estimating the true signal and distractor components in the data.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on explaining and visualizing deep neural networks:- It starts with a fundamental analysis of linear models, showing that the weights do not necessarily reveal the relevant input patterns. This highlights flaws in existing methods like DeConvNet, Guided Backprop, and LRP that become obvious even in simple linear settings. - The paper proposes a novel quality criterion for evaluating signal estimators, based on how much output-correlated information remains in the residuals after removing the estimated signal. This provides a principled way to optimize and compare explanation methods.- It introduces two new methods, PatternNet and PatternAttribution, that learn optimized signal estimators for each layer based on this criterion. These are shown to outperform previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.- The proposed methods are among the first to provide theoretically sound explanations even for simple linear models. Previous popular methods like DeConvNet, Guided Backprop, LRP, etc. fail at this basic task.- Experiments highlight flaws in prevailing assumptions that gradient-based visualizations reveal the input signal. The analysis and proposed techniques generalize recent work on interpreting linear models to deep neural networks. - The approach shares some similarities with concurrent work by Zintgraf et al. and Dabkowski et al. in learning to explain models. But it offers a broader theoretical framework applicable beyond image models.Overall, this paper makes fundamental connections between deep nets and linear models for interpretability. The proposed methods offer improved visualization and attribution with a strong theoretical grounding lacking in many previous techniques. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate clear benefits over existing approaches in identifying the input signals that produce activations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:- Extending PatternNet and PatternAttribution to other types of neural network architectures beyond convolutional neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks. The authors state that their method is generalizable beyond image models.- Exploring other optimization objectives beyond the covariance-based quality measure proposed in the paper for learning the signal estimator. The covariance captures linear relationships between signal and output, but other measures could potentially capture non-linear relationships as well. - Evaluating the proposed methods on additional datasets beyond ImageNet to further demonstrate their general applicability. The authors mainly focused on ImageNet in this work.- Combining the proposed methods with other explanation techniques like occlusion analysis or influence functions to provide complementary insights into model behavior. The paper focuses on gradient-based methods.- Developing quantitative metrics beyond the covariance-based measure to evaluate the quality of explanations, for example metrics that correlate with human judgment of explanation quality.- Extending the analysis and proposed methods to other interpretation tasks beyond image classification, such as explaining predictions for natural language processing tasks.In summary, the main future directions are applying the methods to new models and tasks, exploring new optimization objectives and evaluation metrics, and combining the approach with complementary explanation techniques. The overall goal is to further develop methods that produce sound explanations even for complex nonlinear models like deep neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper analyzes the behavior of explanation methods for deep neural networks in the context of linear models. The authors show that popular methods like DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation do not produce theoretically correct explanations even for simple linear models, since they rely on the model weights/gradients which do not indicate the true "signal" direction in the presence of distractors. Based on this analysis, the authors propose two new methods called PatternNet and PatternAttribution that learn to estimate the signal direction from data in order to produce improved explanations. Experiments on ImageNet show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. The key ideas are that (1) neural network explanations should work reliably even in the limit of simplicity (linear models) and (2) the model weights alone are insufficient - the data distribution must be taken into account as well to properly explain model decisions.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper analyzes explanation methods for deep neural networks, focusing specifically on methods that visualize the input patterns that caused a particular activation in the network. The authors first analyze linear models, showing that the weight vector of a linear model does not necessarily align with the true "signal" direction in the input data. Rather, the weight vector is influenced by distracting components in the data that the model must filter out. The authors argue that popular explanation methods like DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) face similar issues when applied to deep networks, as they rely solely on model parameters and do not properly account for the data distribution. Based on the analysis of linear models, the authors propose two new methods called PatternNet and PatternAttribution that aim to estimate the true signal and attribution in the data. These methods optimize an objective function to identify the directions in the input data that covary with the target variable. The methods outperform previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively on the ImageNet dataset. The authors argue they provide a theoretical and empirical improvement for explaining activations and attributions in deep networks. Overall, the key idea is that faithfully explaining neural networks requires learning how to explain from the data distribution, not just inspecting model parameters.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes PatternNet and PatternAttribution, two new methods for explaining decisions made by neural networks. The key idea is that existing explanation methods like DeConvNet, Guided BackProp, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) do not produce theoretically correct explanations even for simple linear models. The authors first analyze linear models, showing that the weight vector alone is not enough to identify the input patterns that are relevant for the output. They argue that both the model parameters and data distribution are needed. Based on this analysis, they propose an objective function to evaluate how much a signal estimator captures the true signal versus the distractor components. They then introduce PatternNet and PatternAttribution. PatternNet produces visualizations of the estimated signal by replacing the network weights with learned "patterns" that better identify signal directions during backpropagation. PatternAttribution improves on LRP for attributing output contributions to inputs by estimating a "root point" that separates signal from distractor. Experiments on ImageNet show these new methods produce crisper, less noisy explanations compared to prior approaches. Overall, the paper demonstrates the importance of learning to explain neural networks instead of just relying on gradients and weights.
