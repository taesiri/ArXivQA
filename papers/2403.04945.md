Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose MEIT (Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning), the first framework to tackle ECG report generation using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal instructions.
- Key ideas:
   - Create instruction tuning data aligning ECG signals, prompts, and reports
   - Propose efficient attention module to fuse ECG and text representations in LLM
   - Establish comprehensive benchmark with two datasets and tasks on quality, zero-shot learning, robustness

Main Contributions:

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of the Multimodal ECG Instruction Tuning (MEIT) framework. Specifically:

2) The paper establishes a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ECG report generation, encompassing two large-scale datasets and three key tasks - quality evaluation, zero-shot domain transfer, and robustness to signal perturbation.

3) Through extensive experiments benchmarking nine LLMs, the paper demonstrates the superior performance of instruction-tuned LLMs in quality report generation, transferability under zero-shot settings, and resilience against signal noise.

4) The proposed lightweight attention-based fusion approach effectively integrates ECG and text representations across diverse LLMs without introducing additional parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel MEIT framework for automated ECG report generation using multimodal instruction tuning of LLMs, along with the introduction of a systematic benchmark to evaluate this task.
