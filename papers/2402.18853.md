# [Rethinking Multi-domain Generalization with A General Learning Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-domain generalization (mDG) aims to learn models that can generalize well to unseen target domains. Existing methods make assumptions that the target label distribution is static across domains. However, this assumption does not always hold true.

- Current methods also lack a general learning formulation for mDG and overlook issues like integrating prior knowledge and suppressing invalid causality that can emerge when relaxing static distribution assumptions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a General Multi-Domain Generalization Objective (GMDG) with four key components:
  1) Learning domain-independent conditional features (GAim1)
  2) Maximizing a posterior (GAim2)  
  3) Integrating prior knowledge (GReg1)
  4) Suppressing invalid causality (GReg2)

- GMDG introduces mappings φ and ψ to extract domain-independent features from inputs X and targets Y. 

- Theoretical analysis shows GAim1 and GReg1 can be achieved by minimizing Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence (GJSD) with a prior. An upper bound called Alignment Upper Bound with Prior (PUB) is derived.

- GReg2 handles invalid causality issues that arise when relaxing assumptions of static Y distribution across domains. It simplifies to minimizing Conditional Feature Shift.

Contributions:  

- Proposes a general learning formulation for mDG with four synergistic components that relaxes assumptions made by prior work

- Theoretically justifies the objective and provides insights connecting to previous methods

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on mDG tasks including regression, segmentation and classification, outperforming prior methods

- Demonstrates the applicability and superiority of the proposed formulation over a wide range of multi-domain generalization scenarios
