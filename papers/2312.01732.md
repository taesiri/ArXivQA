# [Likelihood-Aware Semantic Alignment for Full-Spectrum   Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01732)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a likelihood-aware semantic alignment (LSA) framework to address the challenging full-spectrum out-of-distribution (F-OOD) detection task, where models need to handle both semantic shift and covariate shift between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The key insight is that high-likelihood visual features close to class centers maintain consistency between ID and covariate-shifted ID (csID) data, being more robust to covariate shift. LSA captures these semantic high-likelihood regions using offline Gaussian sampling of ID embeddings. It also employs a bidirectional prompt optimization strategy, tailored to ID concepts using class-specific contexts and expanded OOD contexts as negative anchors. Experiments on F-OOD benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, with significant gains over prior arts especially on the intractable near-OOD data, demonstrating the method's ability to focus more on semantic shift. Code is available to reproduce results.
