# [Dated Data: Tracing Knowledge Cutoffs in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12958)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) are often advertised with a "knowledge cutoff date", indicating when the training data was collected. This implies that the LLM's knowledge aligns with resources as of that cutoff date. 
- However, in practice there can be a mismatch between the advertised cutoff date (reported cutoff) and when the LLM actually has up-to-date knowledge about a resource (effective cutoff). This can mislead users.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes the notion of an effective cutoff, which is the date that an LLM's knowledge actually aligns with for a particular resource. 
- Develops a perplexity-based method to automatically estimate effective cutoffs for resources by evaluating the LLM on time-spanning datasets (e.g. different snapshots of Wikipedia articles over time).
- Applies this method to probe various open and closed LLMs. Finds that resource-level effective cutoffs often differ significantly from advertised cutoffs, especially for newer models.
- Performs analysis on open pre-training datasets to understand the root causes. Identifies two main reasons - (1) deduplication issues where semantic duplicates remain and (2) temporal mismatch in CommonCrawl dumps.

Overall, the paper demonstrates that knowledge cutoffs are not as simple as claimed. Care must be taken by both LLM creators and users regarding these cutoffs. The notion of effective cutoffs and methods to estimate them are useful tools to enable better understanding of when LM knowledge actually aligns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the difference between the reported knowledge cutoff dates of large language models and their effective knowledge cutoffs, finding that complications in deduplication pipelines and temporal misalignment of CommonCrawl data contribute to inconsistencies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to automatically determine the effective knowledge cutoff date of large language models for a given resource, without needing access to the model's training data. The paper shows that effective cutoffs often differ significantly from claimed "knowledge cutoff" dates provided by model creators, due to complications in deduplication pipelines and temporal misalignment in CommonCrawl data. The analysis provides insight for both users and creators of LLMs regarding the complexities of knowledge cutoffs in these models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper summary, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Effective cutoff - The actual date representing the latest knowledge contained in a large language model's training data for a particular resource, which can differ from the reported cutoff date.

- Reported cutoff - The claimed or advertised date for the latest information contained in an LLM's training data.

- Temporal misalignment - When there is a discrepancy between an LLM's effective cutoff and reported cutoff for a resource. 

- Resource-level analysis - Evaluating the knowledge cutoff of an LLM with respect to specific subsections of its training data, like Wikipedia or New York Times articles, rather than the dataset as a whole.

- Perplexity-over-time curves - Tracking how an LLM's perplexity on documents from a resource changes over time to estimate effective cutoffs. 

- Deduplication complications - Failures in removing duplicate/near-duplicate documents that cause accidental inclusion of older versions of data.

- CommonCrawl temporal biases - The phenomenon of CommonCrawl dumps containing a significant amount of older web content despite being recent dumps.

The key goals are to define and automatically estimate effective cutoffs, understand why they differ from reported cutoffs, and analyze complications with accurately determining and aligning knowledge in large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a simple method to estimate the effective cutoff dates of large language models on a resource level by probing perplexity across versions of that resource over time. What are some potential limitations or challenges with using perplexity as the main evaluation metric in this approach? For example, could there be cases where perplexity changes are not fully indicative of the model's knowledge?

2. When constructing the time-spanning Wikipedia dataset, the paper selects the 5000 most edited pages over a certain time period. How might the choice of pages impact the results? For example, could less edited or more niche pages show different perplexity trends? 

3. The paper normalizes perplexity measurements before analysis by taking the median 95% to remove outlier documents. What impact could this choice of normalization have? Could it hide more fine-grained temporal alignment issues?

4. The mining methodology matches documents in the training set to versions of Wikipedia by finding the version with the lowest normalized edit distance under 20%. What are the limitations of this semantic matching approach? When might it fail to attribute matches accurately?  

5. When analyzing the results, the paper emphasizes the difference between effective cutoff and reported cutoff dates. What other terminology could be used or defined around knowledge cutoffs? Are there other key concepts around this idea that warrant dedicated terminology?

6. Could the methods proposed generalize well to other resources beyond Wikipedia and news articles? What types of resources might be more challenging for the perplexity probing approach?

7. The paper analyzes both frequently updated resources like Wikipedia and accumulating resources like news articles. What other categories of resources commonly used in pre-training could have been analyzed as well? 

8. How does the scale of the model impact the ability to determine effective cutoffs with this approach? Could smaller models show more noise that makes analysis difficult? 

9. What types of models beyond decoder-only transformer LMs could this method apply to? For example, could it work for encoder-decoder models?

10. The paper emphasizes complications around deduplication. What improvements could be made to deduplication schemes used in practice to avoid these issues uncovered by the analysis?
