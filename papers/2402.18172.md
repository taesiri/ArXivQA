## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Real-world outdoor imaging systems used for driving assistance often suffer from degradations like rainy conditions and insufficient lighting at nighttime. This leads to loss of crucial details and poor visibility, impacting vision-based autonomous driving systems. Though image de-raining methods perform well in daytime scenarios, they struggle in low-light rainy nighttime conditions. Hence, there is a need for effective solutions to image de-raining tailored for such adverse driving scenarios.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Cross-View Sensor Cooperative Learning (CVCL) framework for nighttime image de-raining. It consists of two stages - an information Cleaning stage (CleanNet) and an information Fusion stage (FusionNet). 

In the Cleaning stage, a CNN-Transformer network takes the rainy RGB image as input to remove rain streaks and output a clean RGB image. It uses novel modules like Attention-guided Mixture of Experts (AgMoE), Transformer with Top-Selection Self Attention (TSSA), and Mutual Deformable Feed Forward Network (MDFFN) to effectively capture both local and global features of the rainy image for cleaning.

In the Fusion stage, the clean RGB image is fused with the corresponding infrared (IR) image using a FusionNet to get an enhanced clean-fused RGB output. It measures information content of input images to guide fusion. A cascaded refinement unit further balances contrast and color in the fused output through iterative refinement with the IR image.

Main Contributions:
1) First work to address nighttime image de-raining for dynamic driving scenes using cross-sensor fusion 
2) Proposes a Cleaning stage network (CleanNet) to effectively remove rain streaks from rainy RGB images
3) Designs a Fusion stage network (FusionNet) to fuse the clean RGB with IR image to get enhanced clean-fused output
4) Achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively for nighttime image de-raining task
5) Extends applicability of image de-raining and fusion methods to challenging real-world computer vision tasks

The proposed cross-sensor cooperative learning approach effectively solves the problem of nighttime image de-raining for driving assistance systems by synergistically utilizing complementary information from visible and infrared cameras.
