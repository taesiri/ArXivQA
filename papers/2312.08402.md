# [LDM$^2$: A Large Decision Model Imitating Human Cognition with Dynamic   Memory Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08402)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Standard prompting methods that use a few manually crafted examples to prompt large language models (LLMs) for decision-making are limited. The examples restrict the LLMs to imitating fixed patterns and fail to generalize to complex situations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LDM^2, a novel model that enhances LLMs with a dynamic memory mechanism. 

- It has two key stages - memory formation and memory refinement. 

- In memory formation, it decomposes human trajectories into state-action tuples which are stored in memory. The indices for retrieving relevant tuples are also generated by the LLM.

- In memory refinement, tree exploration is used to discover more optimal decisions. The best state-action tuples are added to the memory.  

- The updating memory provides relevant examples to prompt the LLM based on current state, guiding proper decisions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new paradigm of dynamically prompting LLMs for decision-making using a two-stage memory mechanism.

- Leverages LLMs for summarizing trajectories and indexing the memory tuples.

- Refines memory with exploration and adds valuable new tuples, enabling handling of unseen situations.

- Achieves superior performance over baselines on two interactive environments - WebShop and ALFworld.

- Analysis shows more diverse actions and ability to address complex situations unseen in original training data.

In summary, the key idea is enhancing LLMs for decision-making with a dynamically updating memory, formed and refined intelligently using the LLM's own abilities. This provides a better contextual prompt to guide proper decisions in complex environments.
