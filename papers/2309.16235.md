## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper provides an overview of the role of language models in accelerating molecular discovery. Language models have shown promising results when applied to "scientific languages" like proteins, molecules, or polymers, enabling smooth exploration of molecular spaces and bridging natural and scientific languages. The paper outlines how language models can be used for generative modeling of molecules with desired properties, as well as for predicting molecular properties. Key applications include de novo drug design, where language models can propose novel molecular structures with desired pharmacological profiles.
