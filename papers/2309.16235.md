# [Language models in molecular discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16235)

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here is how I would compare this paper to other research in the field of using language models for molecular discovery:- Focus on reviewing applications of language models in chemistry: This paper provides a broad overview of how language models have been applied to various tasks in molecular discovery like molecular representation, generative modeling, property prediction, and software tools. Many other papers focus on proposing a new model or method for a specific application. So this paper serves more as a review of the landscape.- Highlights recent advances: The paper covers very recent advances in this fast moving field, including transformer-based models like the Regression Transformer and prompt-based multitask models. It also points to newly launched software tools and libraries. This keeps the reader up-to-date compared to review papers from 1-2 years ago.- Practical orientation: There is a strong focus on real-world usability through the software section and vision for future practical applications like the ChemChat example. Much academic research in this field can be theoretical, so the practical aspects set this paper apart.- Interdisciplinary readership: The paper appears to target an audience with computer science and chemistry background. Terms are explained clearly. The background bridges chemistry concepts and machine learning. Other papers target one field more heavily.- Sets stage for future opportunities: The vision and ChemChat use cases inspire new directions and methodologies to integrate language models into workflows. The paper concludes by catalyzing thinking about future hybrid human-AI interaction.In summary, this paper provides a high quality interdisciplinary review of applying language models to molecular discovery that highlights recent advances and practical utility to catalyze future research and applications at the interface of AI and chemistry. The practical focus and vision for the future differentiate it from other more theoretical review papers.
