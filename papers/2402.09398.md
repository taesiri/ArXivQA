# [Get More with LESS: Synthesizing Recurrence with KV Cache Compression   for Efficient LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09398)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in natural language processing. However, their deployment is limited by the immense memory footprint of the key-value (KV) cache, which stores previous hidden states during decoding to avoid recomputing them. As model and sequence lengths increase, the KV cache size can eclipse the model size itself. Existing methods address this by pruning the cache to store only a small subset of supposedly less important KV pairs. However, by irrecoverably discarding KV information, these methods degrade performance on tasks requiring recollection of the majority of context tokens.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes LESS (Low-rank Embedding Sidekick with Sparse policy), a method to synthesize sparse caching policies with low-rank caches to retain more contextual information. Specifically, LESS learns low-dimensional embeddings to approximate the residual between the full and sparse attention outputs. By accumulating discarded information into a small constant-sized cache, LESS allows later decoding steps to still query tokens that were previously pruned. This recurrent update of the low-rank cache avoids the need for its size to scale with sequence length.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes LESS, a simple yet effective combination of sparse caches and low-rank states to alleviate the KV cache bottleneck in LLMs while minimizing performance loss.
- Shows LESS substantially narrows the performance gap compared to sparse-only baselines across various models, tasks, and sparsity levels, despite occupying negligible extra space.
- Demonstrates the low-rank cache can successfully reconstruct patterns in attention distributions that sparse methods completely ignore.
- Provides efficient implementations to reduce latency and increase throughput compared to full caching.

In summary, LESS advances sparse caching methods for LLMs by synthesizing them with compact low-rank structures to retain more contextual information throughout time. This allows broader deployment of large models under tight memory constraints.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes LESS, a method to synthesize recurrent low-rank attention with existing sparse attention policies in large language models to reduce memory usage of the key-value cache while recovering performance lost due to sparsity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing LESS, a method to synthesize sparse key-value caching policies with low-rank caches to reduce the memory footprint of the key-value cache in large language models, while minimizing the performance degradation compared to using a full cache. Specifically, LESS learns to approximate the residual between the full attention output and the attention output from a sparse caching policy using a small constant-sized low-rank cache. This allows it to recover information that would have been discarded by the sparse caching policy. The method is shown to improve performance over sparse-only caching baselines on a variety of language modeling, classification, and summarization tasks, while adding little overhead. The key advantages highlighted are reducing the gap to full cache performance, using constant low-rank cache size independent of sequence length, and cheap integration into pre-trained models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Key-value (KV) cache - The computational shortcut that stores previous key-value pairs to avoid recomputing attention at each layer during autoregressive decoding. The explosion in memory consumption of the KV cache creates a bottleneck when deploying large language models.

- Sparse policies/algorithms - Methods that select a subset of the most important KV pairs to cache in order to reduce the KV cache footprint. However, they irrecoverably discard potentially useful information. Examples include heavy hitter attention caching and infinite length generation techniques.

- Low-rank attention - Reformulating the transformer's attention mechanism to maintain a constant sized cache by accumulating information into a low-rank state rather than concatenating KV pairs. This is inspired by recurrent neural networks but comes at the cost of diluting signals. 

- Sparse and low-rank decomposition - Decomposing a matrix into sparse and low-rank components has proven effective for approximation and compression in areas like computer vision and robust PCA. This motivates the design of LESS.

- LESS (Low-rank Embedding Sidekick with Sparse policy) - The method proposed that synthesizes a sparse policy with a small, constant sized low-rank cache to retain discarded information and recover performance lost by sparse-only caching policies.

In summary, the key focus is efficient key-value caching for transformer language models by combining sparse and low-rank structures to attain the compression of the former and the sequence modeling capabilities of the latter.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) How exactly does LESS capture the residual information between the full attention matrix and the sparse approximation? What mathematical operations and formulations allow it to do this effectively? 

2) The paper mentions that training LESS is computationally inexpensive compared to end-to-end training. Can you expand more on the specifics of how LESS is trained on each layer independently? What objectives and constraints make the training process cheaper?

3) In the attention calculation step, what motivated the particular formulation used to approximate the full attention in Equation 2? How was this formula derived and why is it effective? 

4) The paper emphasizes the ability of LESS to work in conjunction with any sparse caching policy. What modifications would need to be made to integrate LESS with sparse methods beyond H2O and Î›-masking?

5) How does the information embedding process in Equations 3 and 4 compare to typical hidden state updates in RNNs? What parallels can be drawn and does this connection provide any insight into LESS?

6) Under what circumstances does LESS start to fail as the sparsity level increases? When does the low-rank approximation become insufficient to capture the residual?

7) Could ideas from LESS be extended to other domains like computer vision where memory is also a bottleneck when processing high-resolution inputs? What modifications would be needed?

8) The ablation studies analyze attention probability reconstruction and the impact of kernel size, but are there other analyses that could provide more insight into LESS?

9) How does LESS specifically provide hope for improved performance on very long sequence tasks compared to baseline methods? Expand on the intuitions discussed in Section 4.3.

10) Beyond the specific improvements tested, what other potential benefits could LESS provide when deployed in practice? How might it interact with other optimization techniques?
