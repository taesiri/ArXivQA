# [Tuna: Instruction Tuning using Feedback from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13385)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we further enhance the performance of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) like Alpaca to generate higher quality responses that better align with human preferences?

The key hypothesis is that by finetuning the instruction-tuned LLM using novel probabilistic ranking and contextual ranking approaches, the model can learn to assign higher probabilities to superior responses over inferior responses. This will enable the model to produce better outputs that are more preferred by humans. 

Specifically, the probabilistic ranking helps the model inherit the relative quality rankings of responses from a teacher LLM like GPT-4. The contextual ranking allows refining the model's own response distribution with the help of a stronger LLM's contextual understanding. 

By applying these techniques, either individually or in combination, the authors hypothesize that the resulting model called Tuna can outperform standard instruction-tuned models like Alpaca as well as competitive reinforcement learning baselines in aligning with human preferences across diverse test benchmarks.

In summary, this paper focuses on improving instruction-tuned LLMs through novel ranking-based finetuning approaches to enhance their capabilities in generating human-preferred responses. The core hypothesis is that learning response quality rankings from external signals can significantly boost model performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two novel methods for further finetuning instruction-tuned language models to improve their performance: probabilistic ranking and contextual ranking. 

The key ideas are:

- Probabilistic ranking involves generating multiple responses per instruction using a powerful teacher model (e.g. text-davinci-003), and then ranking them based on the model's log-likelihoods. This allows the student model to learn to assign higher probabilities to higher quality responses.

- Contextual ranking involves sampling multiple responses per instruction from the student model itself, and then having a stronger model like GPT-4 contextually rank those responses. This helps re-balance the student model's own response distribution. 

The authors show that first applying probabilistic ranking and then contextual ranking to an instruction-tuned model like Alpaca leads to better performance on diverse test sets, outperforming strong reinforcement learning baselines.

In summary, the core contribution is presenting these two novel ranking-based finetuning techniques to enhance instruction-following abilities of language models in a cost-effective manner, without needing extensive human labeling.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes novel methods for finetuning large language models using ranking losses based on the outputs of more powerful teacher models. Specifically, it introduces probabilistic ranking and contextual ranking techniques to teach the student model to distinguish between high and low quality responses. The key finding is that combining both ranking approaches results in a model called Tuna that achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse language understanding tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in instruction tuning and model alignment:

- The main contribution is using probabilistic and contextual ranking to further improve instruction-tuned models like Alpaca. Most prior work has focused just on instruction tuning alone or reinforcement learning. The idea of using ranking data from stronger models is novel. 

- The paper thoroughly evaluates the proposed methods on multiple diverse benchmarks like Super Natural Instructions, LMentry, and Vicuna QA. Many prior works have evaluated on narrower sets of tasks. The comprehensive evaluation provides stronger evidence that the methods generalize.

- The results show the proposed Tuna model outperforming Alpaca and reinforcement learning baselines like PPO-based methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ranking-based tuning approaches. Very few previous methods have been shown to outperform Alpaca or PPO-based RL.

- The work further analyzes the model behavior through ablation studies on factors like ranking data size, order, prompt design, etc. This provides useful insights into the model dynamics. Prior work has tended to lack extensive ablation experiments.

- The authors plan to release model checkpoints and data to facilitate reproducibility. Much instruction tuning research relies on private data/models. The open release will enable more analysis and applications.

Overall, this work makes excellent progress on the challenging problem of aligning large language models with human preferences. The innovations like probabilistic/contextual ranking and extensive experiments significantly advance the state of the art in this area. The analyses also provide valuable insights to guide future research.
