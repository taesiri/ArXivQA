# [Automated Efficient Estimation using Monte Carlo Efficient Influence   Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00158)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Many statistical estimation problems involve estimating a low-dimensional quantity of interest (estimand) in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters. Computing optimal estimators traditionally requires complex manual derivations of efficient influence functions (EIFs) on a case-by-case basis. This process is error-prone and hinders automation.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions (MC-EIF), a general technique to automatically approximate EIFs using stochastic computations already available in probabilistic programming systems. The key insight is that EIFs can be expressed as the product of (i) the gradient of the functional, (ii) the inverse Fisher information matrix, and (iii) the gradient of the log-likelihood. Each of these terms can be approximated via sampling.

Contributions:

- The paper proves MC-EIF is consistent and estimators using MC-EIF achieve optimal convergence rates. 

- MC-EIF works for many models and functionals expressible as probabilistic programs. It frees practitioners from complex manual EIF derivations.

- The modular structure of MC-EIF allows advances in inference methods to directly transfer to advances in efficient estimation.

- Experiments show MC-EIF produces accurate estimates of EIFs, and using MC-EIF for estimation gives comparable performance to analytic EIFs across several benchmarks.

- A novel application of using MC-EIF for optimal portfolio selection is demonstrated, showing the flexibility of the approach.

In summary, Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions introduce an automated, general technique to perform efficient statistical estimation in the kinds of rich, flexible probabilistic models common in modern machine learning. By modularizing efficient estimation, MC-EIF enables practitioners to leverage continuing progress in probabilistic modeling and inference for robust estimation tasks.
