# [Verify-and-Edit: A Knowledge-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the factual correctness and end-task performance of large language model predictions by post-editing reasoning chains generated through chain-of-thought prompting? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on complex reasoning tasks, but can still generate factually incorrect rationales due to the auto-regressive nature of language model decoding. 

2) By introducing external knowledge sources to verify and edit the rationales, the rationales can be made more factually correct.

3) Providing the model with these edited, more factual rationales as refreshed memory will lead to improved end-task performance on question answering and fact verification tasks.

In summary, the central research question is how to improve factual correctness and task performance of LLMs using chain-of-thought prompting by verifying and editing the rationale chains with external knowledge. The key hypothesis is that more factually correct rationales will improve end-task performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the Verify-and-Edit framework for improving the factual correctness of predictions from large language models using chain-of-thought prompting. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Proposing a method to post-edit chain-of-thought style rationales by generating verifying questions, retrieving external knowledge, and editing the rationales informed by the retrieved facts. 

2. Demonstrating that the edited and more factual rationales lead to improved prediction accuracy on multiple open-domain question answering datasets including Adversarial HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Fever fact verification.

3. Showing that combining chain-of-thought prompting with search engines like Google leads to significant accuracy improvements over baselines, providing a promising direction for combining strengths of LLMs and search.

4. Analysis showing the Verify-and-Edit framework is able to correct factual mistakes in rationales and improve logical reasoning. A human evaluation also confirms improved factuality of the edited rationales.

5. Overall, proposing a simple yet effective framework to increase factual correctness in LLMs' predictions by refreshing their memory using external knowledge sources. The conversational nature also provides interpretable thought processes.

In summary, the key contribution is enhancing the prediction accuracy of chain-of-thought prompted LLMs by editing rationales to be more factual using external knowledge retrieval and re-reasoning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

The paper proposes a Verify-and-Edit framework that seeks to increase the factual correctness of language model predictions by generating verifying questions, retrieving external knowledge to answer them, and editing the model's reasoning chains accordingly before making a new prediction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper proposes a new framework called Verify-and-Edit (VE) for improving the factual correctness of reasoning explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. The key idea is to edit and correct the reasoning chains when the model is less confident, by retrieving supporting facts from external knowledge sources.

- Most prior work on improving reasoning chains has focused on either prompt engineering or result calibration. Prompt engineering methods like ReAct and self-ask aim to guide the LLM to generate better explanations, but are limited by the knowledge already inside the model. Result calibration methods like the ye2022unreliability calibrator tune the prediction probabilities based on explanation quality, but don't improve the explanations themselves. 

- The VE framework is most similar to the Selection-Inference (SI) framework in its goal of improving reasoning chain factual correctness. However, SI relies on structured rule-based reasoning and is not designed for open-domain QA. VE uses a more natural, conversational approach to edit explanations by asking/answering verification questions.

- Compared to retrieval augmented methods like REALM, VE better utilizes retrieval for reasoning by editing CoT prompts, rather than just conditioning on retrieved text. This allows maintaining the strength of LLMs in open-ended reasoning.

- Overall, VE makes a novel contribution in being the first approach to directly edit CoT-style rationales to enhance factuality. The gains on multiple QA datasets demonstrate its effectiveness. The conversational nature also makes it interpretable and extendable. Key limitations are reliance on consistency for uncertainty estimation and the retrieval quality.

In summary, the VE framework's idea of editing rationales by retrieving knowledge distinguishes it from prior work, and the results validate it as an promising approach for improving factuality of LLM reasoning. The conversational setup also makes VE flexible and transparent.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore ways to further reduce the noise brought in during the rationale editing stage. The paper notes that introducing external knowledge can sometimes bring in irrelevant or incorrect details that may disrupt the original reasoning chains. Methods to filter or select only the most relevant factual details could help improve the edited rationales.

- Incorporate more diverse knowledge resources beyond Wikipedia and search engines, such as structured knowledge bases, to provide additional factual grounding. This could further enhance the performance and applicability of the framework.

- Experiment with the Verify-and-Edit framework on a broader range of tasks beyond question answering, such as summarization, dialogue, etc. The authors suggest it may be most suited currently for open-domain QA requiring complex reasoning, but the general framework could potentially be adapted to other generation tasks.

- Explore ways to make the framework more interactive, allowing users to naturally interfere or revise the LLMs' reasoning chains. The conversational nature of the framework lends itself to human intervention at different stages.

- Conduct further analysis on what types of questions or claims are best suited for the Verify-and-Edit framework versus other methods. This could help provide guidance on when the approach is most beneficial.

In summary, the main directions are enhancing the knowledge resources, reducing noise, expanding task applicability, increasing interactivity, and better understanding the strengths of the approach compared to others. The overall goal is to further improve the factuality and performance of LLMs' reasoning via the Verify-and-Edit framework.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Verify-and-Edit (VE) framework to improve the factual correctness of predictions made by large language models using chain-of-thought prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting involves generating interpretible reasoning chains to arrive at a prediction, but can still suffer from factual inaccuracies. The VE framework selects uncertain predictions using a self-consistency score, generates verifying questions about the reasoning chains, retrieves factual information from external sources to answer the questions, edits the reasoning chains based on the retrieved facts, and generates new predictions using the edited chains. Experiments on question answering datasets show that the framework can substantially improve prediction accuracy by making the reasoning chains more factually aligned. The framework is designed to be simple, natural, and conversational to make it easy for humans and models to understand. Overall, the VE framework demonstrates a promising approach to controlling the factuality of large language model predictions by interactively introducing external knowledge into the reasoning process.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a Verify-and-Edit framework to improve the factual correctness of reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-thought prompting. Chain-of-thought prompting enables LLMs to provide step-by-step reasoning for their predictions, but can suffer from lack of factual alignment. The Verify-and-Edit framework seeks to address this by post-editing the reasoning chains using external knowledge. 

Specifically, the framework first identifies predictions likely to be incorrect using consistency scoring. For these uncertain predictions, it generates questions to verify key claims made in the reasoning chains, and retrieves factual information from knowledge sources like Wikipedia to answer the questions. The retrieved facts are used to edit the original reasoning chains. The edited chains are then re-prompted to generate new, more factually aligned predictions. Experiments on question answering datasets show accuracy improvements from introducing factual knowledge into the reasoning process. The framework demonstrates a promising direction in combining the reasoning capacity of LLMs with the factual knowledge of external sources like search engines.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Verify-and-Edit (VE) framework that seeks to improve the factual correctness of predictions made by large language models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. The method first uses CoT prompting with self-consistency to generate multiple reasoning chains and identify instances where the LLM is uncertain or inconsistent. For these uncertain instances, the method generates a verifying question about the rationale sentence, retrieves relevant facts from an external knowledge source to answer the question, and then uses the retrieved facts to edit the original rationale. The edited rationale is then fed back into the LLM to generate a new, more factually aligned prediction. By introducing external knowledge to edit and verify the rationales, the method is able to improve prediction accuracy on open-domain question answering datasets that require reasoning across multiple facts. The overall framework provides a way to leverage both the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the factual knowledge of external sources.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Verify-and-Edit: A Knowledge-Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Framework" aims to address the problem of lack of factual correctness and hallucination in large language model predictions, especially for complex reasoning tasks that require multi-hop reasoning chains. 

The key problem being addressed is that large language models like GPT-3 tend to make up facts or details when generating predictions, which leads to unfactual and untrustworthy outputs. This is particularly problematic for tasks like question answering that rely on reasoning over multiple facts.

The paper proposes a "Verify-and-Edit" framework to post-edit the reasoning chains generated by models like GPT-3 to make them more factually aligned before making final predictions. The key idea is to identify uncertain predictions using self-consistency, generate verification questions to check key facts, retrieve external knowledge with systems like Wikipedia/Google to verify and provide additional factual details, edit the reasoning chains by incorporating the retrieved facts, and finally generate new predictions using the edited chains.

In summary, the key problem being addressed is the lack of factual correctness in large language model predictions for complex reasoning tasks, and the proposed solution is a pipeline to verify questionable facts in reasoning chains using external knowledge and edit the chains to improve factuality before making final predictions. The overall goal is to increase the factual alignment and trustworthiness of model predictions.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Verify-and-Edit framework to improve the factual correctness of reasoning chains generated by large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. CoT can improve LLM reasoning ability but suffers from generating unfactual claims. The framework first selects uncertain predictions using self-consistency scores. For these instances, it generates verifying questions about the rationale, retrieves supporting facts from external sources like Wikipedia or Google, and edits the original rationale by providing the retrieved facts to refresh the LLM's memory. The edited rationales are then reused to produce the final prediction. Experiments on question answering datasets show accuracy improvements from incorporating external knowledge into the reasoning process. For example, accuracy on Adversarial HotpotQA improves by 6.5% using Google search. The framework provides a promising direction in combining LLMs with search engines.
