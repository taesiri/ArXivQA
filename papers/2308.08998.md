# [Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we effectively align large language models with human preferences using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in an efficient and scalable manner?The key hypothesis appears to be:By decoupling the dataset growth and policy improvement steps of RL into separate offline stages, we can develop a simple yet effective algorithm called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) that can substantially improve the quality of large language models using RLHF, while being more compute and sample efficient compared to typical online RL methods.Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates the ReST algorithm that consists of iterated "Grow" and "Improve" steps. In the Grow step, the language model policy is used to generate additional training data. In the Improve step, the data is filtered based on a learned reward model and used to fine-tune the policy with offline RL. The central hypothesis is that by exploiting the generated data across multiple Improve steps, ReST can efficiently align language models without needing to interact online with a continually updating policy like in standard RLHF. Experiments on machine translation tasks seem to validate this hypothesis, showing improvements in both automated metrics and human evaluations compared to supervised learning baselines.In summary, the key research question is how to efficiently align LLMs using RLHF, with the central hypothesis being that the proposed ReST algorithm can achieve this goal in a scalable offline manner. The paper appears focused on evaluating this hypothesis across various translation tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new algorithm called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for aligning large language models with human preferences. Specifically, ReST combines ideas from growing batch reinforcement learning and offline RL to iteratively improve a language model policy. It involves two steps:1) Grow: Use the current policy to generate a dataset of samples.2) Improve: Filter the generated samples based on a learned reward model and fine-tune the policy on the filtered dataset using offline RL, with the goal of increasing the reward. These Grow and Improve steps are repeated, with the Improve step applying progressively higher thresholds for filtering. This allows ReST to leverage the generated data more effectively than typical online or offline RL methods.The key benefits highlighted are:- More computationally efficient than online RL.- Can improve over a baseline policy without being restricted by the original dataset. - Easy to inspect data quality between Grow and Improve steps.- Simple approach with few hyperparameters.The method is demonstrated on machine translation tasks, where it is shown to substantially increase the automated metric scores as well as human evaluation scores compared to supervised learning baselines.In summary, the main contribution is proposing ReST as a new algorithm for aligning large language models with human preferences in a sample and compute efficient manner by effectively leveraging offline generated data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on aligning large language models with human preferences:- This paper proposes a simple and efficient algorithm called ReST (Reinforced Self-Training) that combines ideas from reinforcement learning and self-training. Most prior work has focused on complex online reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO which can be computationally expensive.- ReST uses offline RL on a fixed dataset generated by the model rather than continually interacting with the environment. This makes it more efficient and less prone to reward hacking compared to online RL methods. Other recent works like RAFT and Impossible Distillation have also explored offline RL or fixed datasets for alignment.- ReST takes a growing batch RL approach by alternating between generating new data from the model (\texttt{Grow} step) and improving the policy on the fixed dataset (\texttt{Improve} step). In contrast, RAFT does one round of data generation and offline RL.- For the task of machine translation, ReST shows strong improvements over supervised learning baselines on several benchmarks. Prior work has also shown good results for alignment on machine translation, but ReST seems particularly sample and compute efficient.- Most prior work has focused on aligning unconditional text generation. ReST demonstrates efficacy on conditional generation problems like machine translation. The framework seems applicable to other conditional generation tasks as well.- ReST relies on a learned reward model to score generated samples for alignment. Using human feedback directly or combining human scores with learned models could be an area of future work.In summary, ReST proposes a simple and efficient alignment algorithm combining ideas from self-training, growing batch RL, and offline RL. The results demonstrate strong improvements over baselines on machine translation across multiple benchmarks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Developing better reward models that more closely align with human preferences. The authors note that while the learned reward models improved in their experiments, there was still a gap between the reward model scores and human evaluation scores. They suggest incrementally retraining the reward models on human annotated data.- Exploring better RL exploration strategies during the Grow step to cover a broader range of the state-action space and improve generalization. The authors suggest using approaches like MCTS.- Applying ReST to other generative modeling tasks beyond machine translation, such as summarization, dialogue systems, and generative models for images, audio and video.- Mitigating potential issues with overfitting to the reward model, especially when using multiple Grow steps. The authors suggest this could be addressed by fine-tuning the reward model on human annotations.- Comparing to and combining ReST with other related approaches like online RL, Expert Iteration, Impossible Distillation, etc.- Experimenting with different offline RL algorithms and losses during the Improve step to further enhance sample efficiency and stability.- Scaling up experiments to even larger models and datasets.In summary, the main suggestions are around improving the reward modeling, RL exploration, applying ReST more broadly, and combining it with complementary techniques to further enhance the sample efficiency, stability and quality of alignment. The authors position ReST as a general and useful growing batch RL methodology for RL from human feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a simple algorithm called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for aligning large language models with human preferences. ReST is inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning and includes a "Grow" step where the current policy generates samples to augment the dataset, and an "Improve" step where the augmented dataset is filtered by a learned reward model and used to fine-tune the policy with an offline RL objective. The key benefits are that ReST allows data reuse across multiple "Improve" steps, making it efficient compared to online RL methods, and it decouples dataset growth from policy improvement, making it easy to diagnose issues. The authors focus on machine translation as an application and show that ReST substantially improves translation quality on several benchmarks according to automated metrics and human evaluation. Variants using different offline RL losses are tested, with behavioral cloning found to work best. Overall, ReST provides a simple, general and compute-efficient approach for aligning large language models with human preferences using offline RL.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a simple and efficient reinforcement learning algorithm called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for aligning large language models with human preferences. ReST includes alternating grow and improve steps. In the grow step, the current policy is used to generate a dataset by sampling output sequences for given input contexts. In the improve step, the generated dataset is filtered based on a learned reward model and used to fine-tune the policy with an offline RL objective. Multiple improve steps can be done with increasing filtering thresholds. ReST is computationally efficient since the dataset generation is decoupled from policy improvement. It also avoids issues like reward hacking faced by online RL methods. The authors demonstrate ReST for machine translation and show it substantially improves translation quality on several benchmarks based on automated metrics and human evaluation. ReST with just behavioral cloning loss and multiple improve steps outperforms other offline RL algorithms. The performance continues improving with additional grow steps. ReST also benefits from best-of-N sampling at inference time. Comparisons to online RL show ReST reaches better reward scores with less computation and samples. The results indicate ReST is a promising approach for aligning language models to human preferences in a sample and compute efficient manner.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a simple algorithm called Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for aligning large language models with human preferences. ReST is inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning and includes two main steps - Grow and Improve. In the Grow step, the current policy is used to generate multiple output samples for each input context, augmenting the training dataset. In the Improve step, the augmented dataset is filtered based on a learned reward model and used to fine-tune the policy with an offline RL objective. These two steps are repeated, with the Improve step applied multiple times before each Grow step to fully exploit the augmented dataset. ReST allows leveraging offline RL algorithms that can learn from fixed datasets. It is shown to substantially improve the quality of machine translation systems as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation. The key aspects are the ability to iteratively improve policies on augmented offline datasets and the decoupling of data generation and policy improvement into separate offline stages.
