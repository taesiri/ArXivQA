# [HyperPIE: Hyperparameter Information Extraction from Scientific   Publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10638)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is currently no existing work on automatically extracting structured hyperparameter information from scientific publications. Hyperparameter information (e.g. which parameters were used with a model or dataset) is important for reproducibility, analyzing trends, and applications like search and recommendation. However, extracting this information is challenging due to its dense format, use of special notation, and domain-specific language.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors formalize the novel task of Hyperparameter Information Extraction (HyperPIE) as an entity recognition and relation extraction problem. 
- They create a manually annotated dataset spanning machine learning publications from areas like machine learning, computation and language, computer vision, and digital libraries.
- They develop and evaluate two approaches:
   1) A BERT-based supervised model with a custom relation extraction component that outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline by 29% F1.
   2) An approach using large language models (LLMs) prompted to output in YAML format, which shows a 5.5% F1 improvement on average over using JSON for structured output.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the new HyperPIE task
- Manually annotated dataset enabling further research
- BERT-based model with improved relation extraction performance 
- Demonstration that output format impacts LLM performance on complex IE tasks
- Analysis of hyperparameter reporting conventions by applying best model to 15,000 unannotated papers

The paper introduces a novel information extraction task and data to facilitate research in this area. The developed models show improved performance, and analysis of unannotated data demonstrates the utility of the approaches.
