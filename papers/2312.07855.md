# [Exploring Popularity Bias in Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07855)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates whether popularity bias affects the relative performance of different recommendation models on session-based tasks. The authors stratify session datasets by the propensity (probability of exposure) of items and evaluate both nearest-neighbor (SKNN) and neural network models (GRU4REC). On two retail datasets, GRU4REC outperforms SKNN on sessions with less popular items, while SKNN is better on more popular items. However, on a music dataset, GRU4REC consistently outperforms SKNN regardless of popularity strata. To exploit this, the authors ensemble SKNN and GRU4REC, weighting predictions by propensity score. Fixed and dynamic ensemble methods significantly improve over individual models, demonstrating how model choice conditioned on popularity can benefit session recommendation. The contrasting results on retail vs. music datasets suggest propensity effects are dataset-specific. Overall, the paper provides a framework to identify model strengths across data dimensions like popularity for better ensemble and evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores popularity bias in session-based recommendation by stratifying datasets based on propensity scores, finding that deep learning models can outperform nearest neighbor models on less popular items while simpler models perform better on more popular items, and proposes methods to ensemble models based on propensity to improve overall performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper investigates if paradoxical evaluation phenomena exist in session-based recommendation systems, where a simpler model (SKNN) outperforms a more complex model (GRU4REC) on the full dataset, but GRU4REC performs better on some subsets of the data stratified by item popularity.

2. Through experiments on 2 e-commerce and 1 music dataset, the paper shows that GRU4REC does outperform SKNN on less popular items, confirming their hypothesis. The trends are more pronounced on the e-commerce datasets compared to the music dataset.

3. The paper proposes model ensembling methods based on item popularity, assigning different weights to SKNN and GRU4REC predictions based on the propensity score. This ensemble approach leads to improved performance over the individual models, demonstrating the benefit of exploiting model differences on data subsets.

In summary, the key innovation is performing multi-dimensional evaluation on session-based recommendation models, revealing performance differences on data stratified by item popularity. The paper also provides a framework to exploit these differences through ensembling.

The paper explores popularity bias and model performance differences in session-based recommendation systems. It calculates propensity scores to stratify the datasets and evaluate different models (SKNN and GRU4REC) on the stratified data. The key findings are that neural models can outperform KNN models on less popular items, while the opposite holds for more popular items. The paper then ensembles the models using fixed and dynamic weights based on propensity scores, achieving improved overall performance. The main metrics used for evaluation are HR and MRR.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper calculates propensity scores based on the popularity of items. What are some alternative ways propensity scores could be calculated for session-based recommendation tasks? How might those change the subsequent analysis?

2. The paper makes several assumptions in deriving the formula for estimating propensity scores (eq 2). Can you think of scenarios or datasets where these assumptions may not hold? How would violating the assumptions impact the propensity score calculations?

3. When evaluating models on stratified data, two methods are used to calculate action-wise propensity scores. What are the key differences between these methods and their associated limitations? Under what conditions might one method be preferred over the other?  

4. The paper finds differing model performance trends when evaluating on the e-commerce vs music dataset strata. What differences between these datasets could explain this? How might you modify the analysis to account for such dataset differences?

5. The fixed-weight model ensemble method uses a single threshold to split the data. How could a more complex thresholding approach be developed that takes into account dataset-specific factors? What impact might that have?

6. The dynamic-weight ensemble method uses a sigmoid-based transformation on normalized propensity scores. What is the intuition behind this particular transformation? How sensitive are the results to the exact formula used?  

7. Could the propensity score analysis be used for purposes other than stratified evaluation and ensembling, such as bias correction during model training? What approaches might enable this?

8. What other algorithm classes besides KNN and neural networks could be compared using propensity-based stratified evaluation? Would we expect similar trends?

9. The datasets used are closed-loop. How could the analysis be adapted for use with datasets that lack implicit feedback signals? What additional challenges might emerge?

10. The paper focuses on popularity bias. What other sources of bias could impact session-based recommendation and how might propensity scoring help uncover those?
