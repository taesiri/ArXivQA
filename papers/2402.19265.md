# [Learning Logic Specifications for Policy Guidance in POMDPs: an   Inductive Logic Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19265)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a powerful framework for decision-making under uncertainty. However, computing the optimal policy in POMDPs is computationally intractable. Modern online POMDP solvers based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, like POMCP and DESPOT, have shown success but their performance degrades significantly in complex environments with large action spaces or long planning horizons. The quality of heuristics guiding the action selection process is crucial for good performance of these solvers. However, designing accurate and efficient heuristics requires significant human effort and domain expertise.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a method to automatically learn high-quality policy heuristics from execution traces of any off-the-shelf POMDP solver using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). The key ideas are:

1) Formalize the POMDP problem and execution traces in Answer Set Programming (ASP). This involves defining commonsense environment features and grounding them from belief states.

2) Generate training examples as Context-Dependent Partial Interpretations relating actions to environment features. Apply ILP to learn logical policy specifications mapping features to actions.

3) Integrate learned specifications into online solvers - in POMCP for soft guidance in UCT exploration and rollout; in DESPOT for default policy and lower bound.

Main Contributions:

- Method to learn interpretable logical policy heuristics from few POMDP traces (less data and time than neural approaches)  

- Approach is solver-agnostic - traces can be from any solver, specifications help different solvers

- Learned specifications efficiently generalize to more complex unseen scenarios

- Soft guidance in POMCP provides robustness to bad specifications  

- Logic programming enables interpretability to identify issues in specifications

- Experiments on challenging rocksample (large action space) and pocman (long horizon) POMDPs show performance matches handcrafted heuristics

In summary, the paper presents an inductive logic programming based method to automatically learn useful policy heuristics for online POMDP solvers from small amounts of execution data. The learned logical specifications efficiently generalize and provide interpretable guidance to significantly enhance solver performance in complex environments.
