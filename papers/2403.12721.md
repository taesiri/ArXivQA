# [CLASSLA-web: Comparable Web Corpora of South Slavic Languages Enriched   with Linguistic and Genre Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12721)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- South Slavic languages are under-resourced and lack large general corpora to enable linguistic research and development of language technologies. Recently, the MaCoCu project provided web crawls for these languages, but they lack linguistic annotation and metadata needed to analyze the content. 

Solution:
- The authors introduce the CLASSLA-web comparable corpora collection, covering all South Slavic languages with a total of 13 billion tokens. 
- The corpora were created in 3 main steps:
  1) Using the MaCoCu web crawls focused on national domains
  2) Annotating texts linguistically using the CLASSLA-Stanza pipeline 
  3) Enriching texts with genre labels using the X-GENRE multilingual genre classifier
- These steps ensured high-quality, comparable and enriched corpora.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of the largest available general corpora for each South Slavic language
- First linguistically annotated general corpus for Macedonian
- Comparable corpus collection covering a whole language group
- Genre annotation providing insights into functional corpus content 
- Freely available corpora to support linguistic research and language technology development
- Analysis showing web genre distribution correlates with economic development
- Potential to inspire similar web corpus efforts for other languages

In summary, the paper presents the creation of enriched, comparable South Slavic web corpora supporting research in corpus linguistics, digital humanities and language technology creation. The methodology behind the corpora ensures high-quality, reusable data resources for this under-resourced language group.
