# [SpikeNAS: A Fast Memory-Aware Neural Architecture Search Framework for   Spiking Neural Network Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11322)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising for ultra low-power machine learning applications. However, designing optimal SNN architectures is difficult and most existing methods derive SNNs from artificial neural networks or do not consider hardware memory constraints. This limits the accuracy and efficiency of SNNs. 

- The paper identifies the research problem as how to automatically and quickly find an SNN architecture that achieves high accuracy under given memory constraints. An efficient solution would ease SNN deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

Methodology:
- The paper proposes SpikeNAS, a neural architecture search framework to generate accurate and memory-efficient SNN architectures. 

- SpikeNAS first analyzes the impact of different cell operations on accuracy to identify the most significant ones. 

- It then enhances the search space by optimizing operation types and number of cells to maintain accuracy while reducing search time. 

- Finally, it employs a fast, memory-aware search algorithm that explores candidates for each cell individually while tracking the memory footprint to meet specified budgets.

Novel Contributions:
- Analysis of impact of cell operations on SNN accuracy
- Optimizing operation types and number of cells to enhance search efficiency
- Fast memory-aware search algorithm to generate accurate SNN architectures under memory constraints

Results: 
- SpikeNAS improves search speed by up to 347x while maintaining or improving accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.  
- It meets specified memory budgets, saving memory footprint by up to 72% compared to prior NAS techniques.
- It can quickly generate optimized SNN architectures for efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

In summary, the key novelty of SpikeNAS is incorporating memory awareness into the neural architecture search process to automatically design high-quality SNNs suitable for low-power hardware platforms. Its analysis-enhancement-search approach also improves accuracy and efficiency over existing SNN NAS methods.
