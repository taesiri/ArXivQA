## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Biomedical entity linking (BioEL) aims to map biomedical mentions to standard entities in an ontology. It faces two key challenges: 1) Capturing fine-grained interactions between mentions and entities as well as among entities themselves; 2) Generalizing to long-tail entities with limited training examples. Previous methods have limitations in modeling such fine-grained interactions and long-tail entities.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes BioELQA, a novel model that formulates BioEL as a multiple choice question answering (MCQA) task. Specifically:

1) A retriever selects top candidate entities for a given mention. 

2) A $k$NN module retrieves similar labeled training instances to provide contextual clues.

3) The mention, candidates and retrieved instances are formatted as a MCQA prompt with symbols denoting each candidate. This allows explicitly modeling fine-grained interactions between the mention, candidates and among candidates.  

4) A generator takes this prompt and outputs the symbol of the predicted answer. This avoids generating invalid entities.

Main Contributions:

- Novel MCQA formulation of BioEL that enables modeling fine-grained interactions between mentions, candidates and among candidates themselves.

- $k$NN based retrieval of similar instances to provide contextual clues for improving generalization to long-tail entities.

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on several BioEL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of BioELQA.

In summary, BioELQA is an effective MCQA based approach for BioEL that models fine-grained interactions and leverages retrieved instances to enhance long-tail generalization. It achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple datasets.
