# [Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15189)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Biomedical entity linking (BioEL) aims to map biomedical mentions to standard entities in an ontology. It faces two key challenges: 1) Capturing fine-grained interactions between mentions and entities as well as among entities themselves; 2) Generalizing to long-tail entities with limited training examples. Previous methods have limitations in modeling such fine-grained interactions and long-tail entities.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes BioELQA, a novel model that formulates BioEL as a multiple choice question answering (MCQA) task. Specifically:

1) A retriever selects top candidate entities for a given mention. 

2) A $k$NN module retrieves similar labeled training instances to provide contextual clues.

3) The mention, candidates and retrieved instances are formatted as a MCQA prompt with symbols denoting each candidate. This allows explicitly modeling fine-grained interactions between the mention, candidates and among candidates.  

4) A generator takes this prompt and outputs the symbol of the predicted answer. This avoids generating invalid entities.

Main Contributions:

- Novel MCQA formulation of BioEL that enables modeling fine-grained interactions between mentions, candidates and among candidates themselves.

- $k$NN based retrieval of similar instances to provide contextual clues for improving generalization to long-tail entities.

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on several BioEL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of BioELQA.

In summary, BioELQA is an effective MCQA based approach for BioEL that models fine-grained interactions and leverages retrieved instances to enhance long-tail generalization. It achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

BioELQA is a novel biomedical entity linking method that reformulates the task as multiple choice question answering, where a retriever provides candidate entities as answer options to a generator that outputs an answer token, and a kNN module retrieves similar instances from training data to enhance generalization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing BioELQA, a novel biomedical entity linking method that reformulates the task as multiple choice question answering. Specifically, BioELQA has two key features:

1) It introduces a multiple choice prompt that jointly presents the mention text and candidate entities to explicitly model fine-grained interactions between mentions, entities, and among entities themselves. This aims to address challenges in handling fine-grained and morphologically similar entities. 

2) It incorporates a kNN module to retrieve semantically similar instances from training data to formulate a retrieval-enhanced prompt. This provides contextual clues for the model to make more informed predictions, thereby improving generalization and robustness for long-tailed entities.

Through extensive experiments, BioELQA demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark biomedical entity linking datasets. The key innovation lies in the novel problem formulation and model architecture tailored for biomedical entity linking.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with this paper are:

- Biomedical entity linking
- Fine-grained interactions
- Long-tailed entities
- Multiple choice question answering
- Retrieval-augmented model

The paper introduces a new model called BioELQA for biomedical entity linking that frames the problem as multiple choice question answering. The model aims to capture fine-grained interactions between entities through explicitly comparing candidate entities in its formulation. It also employs a retrieval module to enhance generalization for long-tailed entities. So the key terms reflect the main contributions and focuses of this work on biomedical entity linking.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does framing biomedical entity linking (BioEL) as a multiple choice question answering (MCQA) task help capture fine-grained interactions between entities? What are the advantages of this approach?

2. Explain the process of how the retriever module retrieves candidate entities and how it is trained using contrastive learning. What are some positives and negatives of this approach?

3. What is the motivation behind using data augmentation in the generator module? Explain how randomly swapping the order of candidate entities helps improve robustness. 

4. Why is generating answer symbols preferred over generating complete entity names in the multiple choice prompting framework? What are some challenges with generating complete entity names?

5. Explain how the kNN module helps improve generalization capability for long-tail entities. How does concatenating retrieved training instances with the input prompt help the generator make better predictions?

6. Analyze the various components of BioELQA using the ablation study results. Which components contribute the most to the overall performance? Justify your explanation.

7. Pick two interesting case studies from the paper and analyze why BioELQA was able to make the correct prediction while previous methods failed.

8. How do the top retrieved similar instances by the kNN module provide useful contextual clues to help predict long-tail entities correctly? Provide examples to support your explanation. 

9. What are some limitations of BioELQA? When does it fail to make correct predictions compared to previous methods like Prompt-BioEL? Provide case study examples.

10. Suggest ways to improve upon BioELQA framework - what additional contextual information can be incorporated and how can entity disambiguation issues be better addressed?
