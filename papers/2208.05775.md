# [PSUMNet: Unified Modality Part Streams are All You Need for Efficient   Pose-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05775)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we design an efficient and scalable model for pose-based action recognition that achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters compared to existing methods?The key hypotheses of the paper appear to be:1) Using part-based streams instead of treating the skeleton input in a monolithic fashion will enable richer, dedicated representations for actions involving only subsets of joints (e.g. hands or legs). 2) Unifying multiple modalities (joint, bone, velocity) into a single processing pipeline instead of separate streams will enable more efficient training and utilization of inter-modality correlations.3) The proposed model, PSUMNet, will achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on standard pose-based action recognition benchmarks while using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches.4) The part-based stream design will allow PSUMNet to generalize well to both sparse pose inputs (e.g. hand gestures) and dense pose inputs (e.g. full body with many joints).So in summary, the main research question is around developing an efficient yet accurate model for pose-based action recognition, with hypotheses related to part-based processing and unified modality processing. The experiments then aim to validate these hypotheses and show PSUMNet achieves superior efficiency and performance compared to prior state-of-the-art techniques.
