# [A framework for conditional diffusion modelling with applications in   motif scaffolding for protein design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09236)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a unified framework for conditioning diffusion models based on Doob's h-transform. The framework provides theoretical backing for existing conditional generation methods and leads to a proposed novel approach called "amortised training". In amortised training, the conditioning information is provided to the model during training so that it learns to satisfy the conditioning constraints. This differs from other methods that enforce constraints during sampling. The paper illustrates the framework on image outpainting and protein motif scaffolding tasks. An amortised training implementation is tested on these applications and shown to outperform existing conditioning protocols like reconstruction guidance and replacement sampling. The method is analyzed in detail on protein design problems using motif scaffolding benchmarks. Results indicate the approach enables sampling of high quality scaffolds with greater success rates compared to alternatives. Overall, the paper delivers an important theoretical grounding, taxonomy, and new algorithm for conditional generation with diffusion models applicable to domains like image and protein generation.
