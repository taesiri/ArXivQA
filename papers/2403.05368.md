# [Exploring the Links between the Fundamental Lemma and Kernel Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05368)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The fundamental lemma by Willems et al. provides a data-driven characterization of behaviors of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. However, it is limited to linear systems.
- Recent works have proposed extensions of the fundamental lemma to certain nonlinear system classes like Hammerstein and Volterra systems. But the connections to established nonlinear system identification methods remain unclear. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows how kernel regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) can be linked to the fundamental lemma.
- Through a transformation of the linear equation in Hankel matrices, an implicit kernel representation of system trajectories is derived.
- This implicit formulation is shown to be equivalent to the solution of a kernel regression problem with specific properties.

Contributions:
- Provides kernelized versions of the fundamental lemma for LTI systems, Hammerstein systems and differentially flat nonlinear systems.
- Shows that these kernelized fundamental lemmas correspond to exact kernel regression representations for noise-free data.
- Discusses the kernel structures and persistence of excitation requirements. 
- Gives probabilistic interpretation via Gaussian processes to characterize predictive uncertainty.
- Establishes that nonlinear extensions of the fundamental lemma can be seen as special cases of the representer theorem in RKHS regression.

In summary, the paper formally links the fundamental lemma and its nonlinear extensions to kernel regression and RKHS methods. This viewpoint allows leveraging established system identification tools for data-driven modelling based on the fundamental lemma.
