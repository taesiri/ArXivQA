# [From Pixels to UI Actions: Learning to Follow Instructions via Graphical   User Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00245)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that it is possible to train agents to successfully accomplish tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) by relying solely on pixel-based screenshots as input and generic mouse/keyboard actions as output, without access to structured representations like HTML or DOM. 

The key research questions seem to be:

- Can an agent leverage recent advances in pixel-based pretraining (e.g. Pix2Struct) to effectively perceive and understand GUIs for completing tasks based only on visual input?

- Can an agent that receives pixel-based observations and takes generic mouse/keyboard actions match or exceed the performance of humans and prior work that uses text-based inputs and specialized action spaces?

- What training methodology, incorporating elements like behavioral cloning and tree search, is most effective for this setting?

To summarize, the main hypothesis is that pixel-only inputs and generic actions can be sufficient for an agent to accomplish complex GUI-based tasks, challenging the need for structured representations and task-specific action spaces relied on by much prior work. The paper aims to demonstrate this through pretrained models, human benchmarks, and training techniques tailored for this setting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that an agent can learn to accomplish tasks in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using only pixel-based screenshots as observations and generic mouse/keyboard actions, without relying on structured representations like HTML or DOM trees. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- They develop an agent called Pix2Act that uses a Transformer model pretrained on parsing screenshots to structured HTML. This allows the agent to understand GUIs from raw pixels.

- They adapt two benchmark tasks, MiniWoB++ and WebShop, to use pixel observations and generic actions. Prior work on these tasks used structured representations.

- Their agent outperforms human crowdworkers on MiniWoB++, improving significantly over prior pixel-based agents. It is competitive with state-of-the-art methods that use structured representations.

- They establish the first results for WebShop using pixel inputs and generic actions. There is still a gap compared to state-of-the-art methods that leverage HTML.

- They show the importance of pretraining on parsing screenshots for these tasks through ablation studies.

- They demonstrate a simple tree search method to improve the agent's policy using offline data.

Overall, this is the first work to show an agent can match or exceed human performance on complex GUI instruction following benchmarks using only pixels and generic actions, demonstrating the potential of pixel-based agents to accomplish useful interactive tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes an agent called Pix2Act that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks in graphical user interfaces, using only pixel observations and generic mouse and keyboard actions, without relying on structured representations like HTML; through pretraining and policy optimization, Pix2Act matches or exceeds human performance on the MiniWoB++ benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses on developing agents that can interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using only pixel-level observations and generic mouse/keyboard actions. Most prior work has relied on additional structured inputs derived from the underlying HTML/DOM. So this is novel in showing that agents can effectively learn to follow instructions and complete tasks directly from pixels.

- The paper shows that with proper pretraining on parsing screenshots, the agent (Pix2Act) can exceed human performance on the MiniWoB++ benchmark. This is an important result, as prior work has generally fallen short of human abilities on these types of GUI interaction tasks. 

- Pix2Act builds on recent progress in vision transformers and pixel-level pretraining. So it connects to that line of work, showing how those models can be adapted for instruction following. The ablations in the paper highlight the gains from pretraining.

- For MiniWoB++, Pix2Act reaches performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that use DOM inputs and human demonstrations. This helps close the gap between pixel-based and structured input agents. Though there is still a gap compared to large language models using HTML inputs on WebShop.

- The paper establishes a general framework for studying GUI agents with unified pixel observations and mouse/keyboard actions. This could enable more systematic comparisons between different methods in future work.

- The use of tree search for policy improvement is a simple but effective technique in this setting. The paper shows how search can be integrated with pretrained vision models to achieve strong sample efficiency.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress in developing agents that can interact with GUIs in a more human-like end-to-end pixel-in, actions-out manner. The results highlight the potential of pixel-based representations and pretraining for these tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing agents that can handle more complex web-based tasks beyond MiniWob++ and WebShop, such as compositional instructions and tasks requiring longer-term memory and reasoning. The models proposed in this paper are limited to relatively simple instruction following in fairly constrained environments.

- Scaling up the model size and pretraining data. The authors use a relatively small 282M parameter model architecture and pretrain on screenshot parsing. They suggest pretraining larger models on more web data could improve performance further.

- Reducing the gap between pixel-based models like the one proposed here and text/HTML-based models by improving vision encoders and incorporating OCR and layout parsers.

- Developing better offline RL algorithms and approximate reward modeling techniques to improve sample efficiency for web environments where data collection can be expensive. The tree search approach used in this work may not scale well.

- Studying generalization and transfer learning more extensively across web environments and tasks, which is important for real-world applicability. The paper includes only limited analysis on held-out tasks.

- Comparing different search algorithms beyond the Monte Carlo Tree Search used here to find the most effective and efficient approaches.

- Performing more in-depth ablation studies on model components like past frame conditioning.

- Considering additional modalities beyond just pixels, such as object detections, text from OCR, etc.

In summary, the key directions mentioned are developing models that can handle more complex tasks and instructions, scaling up models and pretraining, improving sample efficiency for web environments, studying generalization more extensively, and incorporating additional modalities beyond just pixels.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on building agents that can interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like web pages to accomplish tasks, using the same visual inputs and generic mouse/keyboard actions that humans use. The authors present Pix2Act, an agent based on the Pix2Struct model pretrained on parsing screenshots into simplified HTML. Pix2Act takes in pixel-based screenshots as input and outputs mouse/keyboard actions encoded as text. The agent is trained on human demonstrations and improved via tree search for policy iteration.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper focuses on building agents that can interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like web pages to accomplish tasks given in natural language instructions. Most prior work has relied on structured representations like HTML source code or DOM trees as input, as well as task-specific action spaces. In contrast, this paper proposes an agent called Pix2Act that uses only pixel-level screenshots as input and outputs generic mouse and keyboard actions. Pix2Act is built on top of the Pix2Struct model, which is pretrained to parse screenshots into simplified HTML. The agent is trained using a combination of human demonstrations and reinforcement learning based on Monte Carlo tree search. 

The authors evaluate Pix2Act on two benchmark tasks adapted to use pixel inputs and generic actions - MiniWoB++ and WebShop. On MiniWoB++, Pix2Act achieves significantly higher performance compared to prior work on this setting, and even exceeds human performance. Ablations demonstrate the importance of Pix2Struct's screenshot parsing pretraining for this result. On WebShop, Pix2Act establishes the first baseline with pixel inputs, although there is still a gap compared to state-of-the-art models using HTML inputs. Overall, this work represents an important step towards building agents that can interact with GUIs using the same pixel-level inputs as humans.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes Pix2Act, an agent for following instructions via graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using only pixel-based observations and generic mouse and keyboard actions. Pix2Act is based on Pix2Struct, a Transformer model pre-trained on a screenshot parsing task to predict simplified HTML from screenshots. Pix2Act fine-tunes this model on human demonstrations and iteratively improves it using tree search to generate new training episodes. The model takes as input pixel-based screenshots augmented with the instruction text and cursor position. It outputs sequences of mouse and keyboard actions represented as text tokens. Pix2Act is evaluated on two benchmark tasks, MiniWob++ and WebShop, adapted to use the proposed pixel-based observations and generic actions. The results show that, for the first time, an agent relying solely on pixels and generic actions can exceed human performance on MiniWob++ and establish competitive baselines on WebShop. Ablations demonstrate the importance of Pix2Struct's pre-training on parsing screenshots for this pixel-based instruction following task.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the challenge of building agents that can interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to accomplish tasks by following natural language instructions. Specifically, it focuses on the setting where the agent receives pixel-based screenshots as observations and must output generic mouse and keyboard actions, rather than relying on structured representations derived from the underlying GUI code (like HTML). The key question is whether an agent can learn to effectively follow instructions in this setting using only pixel inputs and low-level actions.

The paper notes that most prior work has relied on structured representations and custom task-specific action spaces, which may not always be available. In contrast, humans can interact with new GUIs they encounter by perceiving the visual interface. So the paper investigates whether an agent can do the same using the conceptual interface humans use - pixels and generic actions.

The main contribution is showing that with the right training methodology, such an agent can in fact outperform humans on the MiniWob++ benchmark for GUI task instruction following, despite the increased difficulty of pixel inputs and generic actions. This is the first time an agent has exceeded human performance in this setting.
