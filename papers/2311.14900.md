# [Resfusion: Prior Residual Noise embedded Denoising Diffusion   Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing end-to-end models for image segmentation cannot completely fit the ground truth segmentation masks. There is a gap between the likelihood output (predicted masks) and ground truth masks.  
- Current denoising diffusion models are generative models that cannot bridge different domains or combine with end-to-end models.
- Previous works utilizing denoising diffusion for segmentation are limited to small models and datasets, unable to generalize well.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel Residual Diffusion (ResFusion) process that models the residual noise (termed "resnoise") between the likelihood output and ground truth. 
- Unify the training and inference denoising processes through resnoise diffusion, thereby seamlessly integrating end-to-end and diffusion models.
- Introduce a "smooth equivalence transformation" to determine optimal acceleration step T' where posterior = prior distributions. Allows fast training and inference.
- Condition the diffusion model on input image to guide the denoising towards the ground truth in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Key Contributions:
- First framework to seamlessly combine end-to-end models with diffusion models through residual noise modeling.
- Determine optimal inference acceleration through proposed smooth equivalence transformation.
- Generalizable framework beyond segmentation to any image generation task combining end-to-end and diffusion models.
- State-of-the-art performance on segmentation using larger models and datasets.
- Strong performance on image denoising, dehazing, deraining and other generation tasks.

In summary, ResFusion bridges end-to-end and diffusion models via residual noise modeling and acceleration. It is a generalizable framework for various image generation tasks, outperforming previous specialized approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes Resfusion, a framework that seamlessly integrates end-to-end models and denoising diffusion models for image generation tasks by learning the residual noise between the likelihood output and ground truth and determining an optimal acceleration step.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel "resnoise-diffusion" process to close the gap between the likelihood output from an end-to-end model and the ground truth output through a Markov process. This allows seamlessly integrating end-to-end models and denoising diffusion models.

2) It introduces a "smooth equivalence transformation" technique to determine the optimal acceleration step T' where the posterior probability distribution becomes indistinguishable from the prior. This allows accelerating both training and inference. 

3) The proposed ResFusion framework is versatile and can be applied to any image generation task, not just segmentation. Experiments show it can be easily extended to other domains like image denoising, restoration etc.

4) Compared to prior work on diffusion models for segmentation, ResFusion attempts to use larger models and datasets, demonstrating strong capabilities and generalization potential across various tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is a flexible ResFusion framework that can seamlessly combine end-to-end and diffusion models through a resnoise diffusion process and accelerate training/inference by determining an optimal step. It is widely applicable for image generation tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Resnoise-diffusion - The proposed diffusion process that learns the residual noise between the likelihood output and ground truth to bridge their gap.

- Smooth equivalence transformation - The proposed method to determine the optimal acceleration step T' where the posterior distribution becomes equivalent to the prior distribution. 

- Resfusion - The name of the overall proposed framework that combines end-to-end models and diffusion models by learning resnoise.

- Likelihood output - The output generated by an end-to-end model that approximates the ground truth distribution. 

- Residual term - The difference between the likelihood output and ground truth defined as R.

- End-to-end model - Refers to models that directly map inputs to outputs, used here to generate likelihood outputs.

- Denoising diffusion models - Generative models that produce data by reversing a noise corruption process.

- Markov process - A stochastic process used to model the residual noise diffusion.

- Acceleration - Speeding up training and inference by starting reverse diffusion from step T'.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed Resfusion framework, its components like resnoise-diffusion and smooth equivalence transformation, and concepts like likelihood outputs, residuals, end-to-end models and diffusion models that it connects.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel "resnoise-diffusion" process. Can you explain in more detail how this process helps bridge the gap between the likelihood output and ground truth output? What is the intuition behind learning this "resnoise"?

2. The determination of the acceleration step T' is a key contribution. Can you walk through the mathematical derivation of how T' is computed? What does it signify about the posterior and prior distributions at this step?

3. How exactly does the proposed method unify the training and inference denoising processes? What changes need to be made to the traditional diffusion process formulations? 

4. One claim is that the proposed method can seamlessly integrate end-to-end models and diffusion models. Can you expand on what architectural modifications enable this integration? 

5. The method computes the likelihood output using an end-to-end model, which is then cached. How does caching this output help accelerate training? What are the memory vs compute tradeoffs?

6. Traditional diffusion models predict the noise at each denoising step. How is the proposed "resnoise" prediction different? What extra information does it encode?

7. The method claims versatility across image generation tasks, not just segmentation. Can you discuss what architectural or algorithmic components lend this versatility?

8. The method uses larger models and datasets compared to prior diffusion segmentation methods. What modifications were important to show strong capability at larger scale?  

9. The inference process takes the original image as a conditional input at each denoising step. What is the motivation behind this? How does it help guide the diffusion direction?

10. The method computes an optimal acceleration step T'. How does the bias tradeoff change with total steps T? What determines the smallest feasible T for near zero bias?
