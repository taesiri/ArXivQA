# [Resfusion: Prior Residual Noise embedded Denoising Diffusion   Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14900)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing end-to-end models for image segmentation cannot completely fit the ground truth segmentation masks. There is a gap between the likelihood output (predicted masks) and ground truth masks.  
- Current denoising diffusion models are generative models that cannot bridge different domains or combine with end-to-end models.
- Previous works utilizing denoising diffusion for segmentation are limited to small models and datasets, unable to generalize well.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel Residual Diffusion (ResFusion) process that models the residual noise (termed "resnoise") between the likelihood output and ground truth. 
- Unify the training and inference denoising processes through resnoise diffusion, thereby seamlessly integrating end-to-end and diffusion models.
- Introduce a "smooth equivalence transformation" to determine optimal acceleration step T' where posterior = prior distributions. Allows fast training and inference.
- Condition the diffusion model on input image to guide the denoising towards the ground truth in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Key Contributions:
- First framework to seamlessly combine end-to-end models with diffusion models through residual noise modeling.
- Determine optimal inference acceleration through proposed smooth equivalence transformation.
- Generalizable framework beyond segmentation to any image generation task combining end-to-end and diffusion models.
- State-of-the-art performance on segmentation using larger models and datasets.
- Strong performance on image denoising, dehazing, deraining and other generation tasks.

In summary, ResFusion bridges end-to-end and diffusion models via residual noise modeling and acceleration. It is a generalizable framework for various image generation tasks, outperforming previous specialized approaches.
