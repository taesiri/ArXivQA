# [Modeling Considerations for Developing Deep Space Autonomous Spacecraft   and Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
The paper discusses the growing need for spacecraft to have increased levels of autonomy, enabled by models of the spacecraft's subsystems and environment. While simple models have been used in past missions for basic "functional-level" autonomy, future missions to complex and uncertain environments will likely require more advanced "system-level" autonomy. This demands situational awareness and reasoning across subsystems, necessitating the refinement and interconnection of subsystem models. However, arbitrarily increasing model fidelity introduces tradeoffs related to reliance on unavailable states, computational complexity, design complexity, prediction accuracy, etc. There is a need to analyze these subsystem modeling tradeoffs.

Proposed Solution 
The paper provides a qualitative analysis of model fidelity for four key spacecraft subsystems - power, attitude control, navigation and communications. It categorizes progressively higher tiers of models based on effects captured, identifies where couplings exist among subsystems, and discusses autonomy implications. This analysis serves to inform future subsystem modeling efforts, system-level autonomy algorithm development, and physics-based spacecraft simulators used for validation.

Main Contributions
(i) Categorization of model fidelity levels across four spacecraft subsystems, outlining progressively higher-fidelity considerations
(ii) Identification of couplings among subsystem models, enabling cross-subsystem analysis and direct modeling 
(iii) Discussion of modeling tradeoffs as a basis for future quantitative studies evaluating model relevance for system-level autonomy tasks
(iv) Case study demonstrating the use of an interconnected set of low-fidelity models for autonomous small body rendezvous, indicating promise for developing system-level capabilities  

In summary, the paper takes an initial step toward assessing subsystem models required for reliable autonomous spacecraft operation, highlighting interconnecting models as a promising direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper analyzes different levels of model fidelity across four key spacecraft subsystems - power, attitude control, navigation, and communications - in order to inform the development of future spacecraft autonomy algorithms and physics-based simulators used for validation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

(i) A qualitative analysis of possible subsystem models that may be required onboard future autonomous spacecraft. This includes categorizations based on model fidelity levels and identifications of couplings among models of four major spacecraft subsystems: power, attitude GNC, navigation, and communications.

(ii) A discussion of modeling tradeoffs associated with different fidelity levels. This serves as a basis for future quantitative trade studies to evaluate the relevance of model fidelity for enabling system-level autonomy capabilities. 

(iii) A case study demonstrating the use of an interconnected set of low-fidelity models to achieve autonomous rendezvous with a small body target during the cruise and approach mission phases.

In summary, the paper takes a first step toward a holistic, system-level assessment of multiple spacecraft subsystems and their associated models to enable greater autonomous spacecraft capabilities in the future.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Spacecraft onboard autonomy - the ability of a spacecraft to achieve mission goals with limited external control. Two main levels are functional-level autonomy within subsystems and system-level autonomy across subsystems.

- Subsystem models - models that describe the behavior of spacecraft subsystems like power, attitude control, navigation, and communications. These models support the development of autonomy algorithms.

- Model fidelity - refers to the level of detail and accuracy in modeling a system. Low fidelity models are simpler while high fidelity models aim to capture more complex effects. 

- Tradeoffs - increasing model fidelity introduces tradeoffs like reliance on unavailable states, computational intractability, and design complexity. The appropriate level of fidelity depends on the subsystem and intended autonomy use case.

- Small body exploration - the paper analyzes model fidelity in the context of a mission involving autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations with a distant asteroid or comet.

- MuSCAT - the simulation software used to run spacecraft autonomy experiments. It integrates low fidelity models across subsystems.

The key focus is on analyzing fidelity tradeoffs in onboard spacecraft models to inform future development of autonomy algorithms and simulators. The concepts span multiple disciplines like dynamics and controls, estimation, spacecraft design, etc.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes categorizing spacecraft subsystem models into different fidelity levels. What are some of the key criteria used to determine whether a model should be classified as low fidelity versus high fidelity? How clear-cut are those categorizations in practice?

2. The paper argues that system-level autonomy requires higher fidelity models that capture interdependencies between subsystems. However, it also notes that higher fidelity models may be intractable to run onboard spacecraft due to computational constraints. What types of analyses or simulations could help determine the "sweet spot" in terms of model fidelity to balance accuracy and computational tractability?  

3. For a given spacecraft subsystem like power or attitude control, what quantitative or qualitative techniques could be used to evaluate the performance gains in autonomy tasks like state estimation or prediction when using higher fidelity models compared to lower fidelity models?

4. The paper proposes that reconciling state estimates from interconnected subsystem models can promote robustness and safety. However, what steps would need to be taken if the estimates from different subsystems significantly diverge? How could the autonomy system determine which estimate(s) to trust more?

5. The solar array current-voltage curve model enabling maximum power point tracking (Section IV.A) requires non-parametric storage of empirical data or complex analytical/learning-based models. Given the memory and computational constraints onboard spacecraft, what simplifying assumptions could be made to develop a "middle fidelity" model suitable for prediction?

6. For resource-constrained spacecraft, what criteria should guide the prioritization of increasing model fidelity for certain subsystems over others? That is, on what basis could we determine whether to devote more modeling resources to the power subsystem versus the communications subsystem, for example?  

7. The paper argues that high fidelity flexible body dynamics models for attitude control are better suited to ground-based simulation, while simpler rigid body models are used onboard spacecraft to design control algorithms robust to unmodeled effects. What potential risks or downsides might result from this simulation-based verification approach? 

8. For the navigation subsystem, how can the autonomy system determine the best times to switch the center of orbit propagation between different massive bodies as the spacecraft travels in deep space? What triggering events or estimated state uncertainties should guide that transition?

9. The paper proposes the use of hidden Markov models in the communications subsystem to capture link dynamics. What types of experiments or flight data would be needed to train and validate those statistical channel models to ensure acceptable prediction performance? 

10. For increased model fidelity in general, higher computational complexity often necessitates approximations or lossy model reduction techniques. What procedures could be implemented onboard to quantify or bound the cumulative impact of those approximations on prediction accuracy within safety margins?
