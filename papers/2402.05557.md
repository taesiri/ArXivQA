# [On Convolutional Vision Transformers for Yield Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05557)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Precise yield prediction is important for economic and logistical planning in agriculture. Remote sensing data provides cost-effective data for yield prediction models.  
- Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods like CNNs, LSTMs have been explored. However, vision Transformers are sparsely tested for yield prediction despite good performance in other vision tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) which combines advantages of CNNs and Transformers for image tasks.
- Use multi-year USDA soybean yield data and preprocessed MODIS satellite histogram data from previous work. 
- Compare CvT variants and tune hyperparameters. Evaluate on out-of-sample test years using RMSE and R^2 metric.
- Compare performance with CNN and XGBoost methods from previous work.

Results:
- Larger CvT variants perform slightly better but have longer runtimes. Customizing token projections helps in some cases.
- However, even the best CvT variant achieves worse performance than CNN and much worse than XGBoost.

Conclusion:
- Results suggest local correlations in histogram data are more informative than global correlations that Transformers capture well.
- Potential for better Transformer performance with different preprocessing or tokenization of imagery, alternate Transformer models, additional temporal modeling.
- But findings indicate CNNs and gradient boosting trees currently more suitable for soybean yield prediction problem.

Main Contributions:
- First rigorous evaluation of a vision Transformer (CvT) for soybean yield prediction. 
- Identified current limitations of vision Transformers for agricultural regression problems.
- Provided guidance on future research directions to improve Transformer performance for yield prediction.
