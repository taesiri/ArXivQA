# [Mobile V-MoEs: Scaling Down Vision Transformers via Sparse   Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04354)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to use sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to scale down Vision Transformers (ViTs) to improve their trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for resource-constrained vision applications. 

Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates a simplified, mobile-friendly sparse MoE design called Mobile V-MoE, which routes entire images rather than individual patches to experts. The paper also proposes a training procedure using super-class information to guide the router training.

The central hypothesis is that the proposed sparse Mobile V-MoE approach will allow scaling down ViT models to achieve better accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs compared to the corresponding dense ViT baselines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design to scale down Vision Transformers (ViTs) and make them more efficient for mobile and resource-constrained vision applications. Specifically:

- They propose a simplified mobile-friendly MoE design where routing is done per-image rather than per-token. This allows activating fewer experts per image. 

- They develop a training procedure using super-class information to guide the router training. This results in more stable training compared to end-to-end learned routing.

- They empirically demonstrate on ImageNet that their proposed Mobile Vision MoEs (V-MoEs) achieve better performance vs efficiency trade-offs compared to dense ViTs across different model scales.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a sparse MoE approach tailored for scaling down ViTs to be more efficient, through modifications to the model architecture and training procedure. This allows ViTs to become more amenable to mobile and resource-constrained vision settings.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a simplified and mobile-friendly design for sparse Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformers by routing entire images rather than patches to experts and using super-class information to guide the training, showing improved efficiency-accuracy trade-offs compared to dense models across scales.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on Vision Transformers and Mixture-of-Experts models:

- The focus on scaling down Vision Transformers for mobile/resource-constrained settings is quite novel. Most prior work has focused on scaling up transformers using MoEs for large-scale modeling.

- The proposed simplified mobile-friendly MoE design with per-image routing and single router per layer is different from typical MoE architectures like Switch Transformers that use per-token routing.

- The super-class based routing training procedure is a simple and effective approach to avoid expert imbalance, compared to more complex load balancing losses used in other MoEs. 

- Empirical comparisons against dense vision transformer baselines across a range of model sizes demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy vs FLOPs tradeoff.

- Ablation studies provide useful insights into optimal model hyperparameters like number of experts, MoE layers, activated experts per image etc.

Overall, this paper explores an interesting and underexplored direction of scaling down transformers via conditional computation. The simplified mobile-friendly MoE design and routing training approach are intuitive yet effective. The empirical analysis is quite thorough. This provides a promising approach to improve efficiency of vision transformers for mobile applications.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply the proposed MoE design to models that are more mobile-friendly than vanilla ViTs, such as lightweight CNNs like MobileNets or ViT-CNN hybrid architectures. The goal would be to further improve the performance vs efficiency trade-off for resource-constrained vision applications.

- Evaluate the proposed approach on other computer vision tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection. This would demonstrate the general applicability of the method.

- Obtain actual on-device latency measurements for all models compared in the paper. This would provide a more direct assessment of the efficiency benefits of the proposed MoE approach. 

- Investigate different expert specialization strategies beyond using super-classes. For example, specializing experts on different spatial regions of the image.

- Study how to best leverage mixtures of different expert types, e.g. combining convolutional and attention-based experts.

- Explore sparsity patterns beyond image-level routing, e.g. patch-level routing but with higher efficiency than the per-token routing approach.

- Analyze the proposed MoE approach from an information-theoretic perspective to better understand its properties.

In summary, the main future directions are applying the MoE approach to more mobile-friendly base architectures, evaluating on more vision tasks, measuring on-device efficiency, and exploring alternative expert specialization and sparsity strategies. The overall goal is to further improve the performance vs efficiency trade-off of vision models for resource-constrained applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes Mobile V-MoEs, a novel approach for scaling down Vision Transformers (ViTs) via sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to improve their performance vs efficiency trade-off for resource-constrained vision applications. The key ideas are: 1) Using per-image rather than per-token routing for inference efficiency. 2) Leveraging semantic super-classes to guide router training for training stability. 3) Empirically showing on ImageNet that the proposed sparse Mobile V-MoEs outperform dense ViTs across model scales in terms of accuracy under similar FLOP budgets. For example, for a ViT-Tiny model, the sparse Mobile V-MoE improves accuracy by 3.39% with similar FLOPs. The approach makes ViTs more amenable to mobile applications.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve the efficiency of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for mobile computer vision applications. The key ideas are 1) routing entire images rather than patches to experts, enabling lower inference cost, and 2) guiding the router training with super-class information to improve training stability. Specifically, the authors propose a simplified MoE design where a single router assigns each input image to one of the experts. This contrasts with prior work that routes patches. To avoid expert imbalance during training, super-classes are derived from a dense ViT's confusion matrix and used to supervise the router. 

Empirically, the proposed Mobile Vision MoE (V-MoE) improves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across scales of ViT models on ImageNet classification. For example, for ViT-Tiny the V-MoE outperforms the dense ViT by 3.4% top-1 accuracy. Ablation studies validate design choices, showing that using 2 MoE layers out of 12 total layers works best, and that activating 1-2 experts per image is better than more. The approach improves ViTs' performance vs. efficiency trade-off, demonstrating the promise of conditional computation for scaling down models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a simplified and mobile-friendly design for sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Vision Transformers (ViTs). Instead of routing individual image patches to experts like in prior work, the proposed method routes entire images to the experts using a single per-image router. This reduces the inference cost and memory requirements. Additionally, instead of end-to-end training, the router is trained with a separate loss to assign images to experts based on semantic super-classes. This avoids training instability issues with expert balancing. Empirically, the proposed sparse Mobile Vision MoE (V-MoE) improves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency compared to dense ViTs across a range of model sizes on ImageNet image classification. For example, for a small 54M FLOPs ViT model, the V-MoE achieves a 4.66% accuracy improvement over the dense baseline.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of scaling down Vision Transformers (ViTs) to make them more suitable for resource-constrained vision applications, such as on mobile devices. The key questions it seeks to address are:

- What modifications need to be made to the typical MoE design to make it more suitable for mobile vision settings?

- How can training stability be improved for MoEs in this setting?

In particular, the paper proposes a simplified, mobile-friendly MoE design that routes entire images rather than individual patches to experts. It also proposes a training procedure using super-class information to guide the router and avoid expert imbalance. The key research questions are whether this approach can successfully scale down ViTs and achieve better accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs compared to dense ViTs.
