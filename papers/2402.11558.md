# [Temporal Disentangled Contrastive Diffusion Model for Spatiotemporal   Imputation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11558)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Spatiotemporal data is prevalent across domains like transportation, healthcare, etc. but often suffers from missing values due to sensor errors, transmission failures, etc. 
- Spatiotemporal imputation aims to estimate these missing values by exploiting spatial and temporal dependencies.  
- Traditional statistical and ML models make simplifying assumptions about the data and perform poorly on complex real-world data.
- Recent deep learning models like RNNs and GANs accumulate errors or produce unstable results.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes C^2TSD, a conditional diffusion framework for spatiotemporal imputation.
- It incorporates contrastive learning and trend-season disentanglement to effectively capture spatiotemporal relationships.
- A trend-season disentanglement module extracts explainable temporal dependencies by separating trend and seasonal components.
- Contrastive learning optimizes the model and improves generalization on unseen samples.  
- Conditional features from trend and season representations guide the generative diffusion process to produce reliable outputs.

Main Contributions:
- A conditional diffusion framework C^2TSD for spatiotemporal imputation using contrastive learning and trend-season disentanglement.
- A trend-season disentanglement module to enhance temporal relationship learning and explainability.
- A contrastive learning strategy to improve model generalization.  
- Experiments on real-world meteorology and transportation datasets demonstrate C^2TSD's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in advancing conditional diffusion models for the spatiotemporal imputation problem by strategic incorporation of contrastive learning and time series decomposition techniques.
