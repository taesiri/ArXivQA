# [Graph-enhanced Large Language Models in Asynchronous Plan Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reasoning about asynchronous plans involving both sequential and parallel actions is challenging as it requires optimizing time costs. It is unclear if large language models (LLMs) can succeed at this task.

- To enable evaluation, the authors automatically generate a new benchmark called AsyncHow with 1.6k high-quality instances of real-life asynchronous planning tasks.

Method: 
- Experiments are conducted with representative closed-source (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Command) and open-source (LLaMA, Mistral) LLMs.

- LLMs perform poorly without illustrations of the task-solving process. To address this, the authors propose a novel technique called Plan Like a Graph (PLaG) that combines graphs with natural language prompts.

- PLaG converts planning tasks into equivalent graph problems that LLMs can reason about. Two variants are tested: providing an explicit graph, and instructing models to build their own graph (BaG).

Results:
- PLaG boosts performance of all models, with GPT-4 + PLaG achieving new state-of-the-art results. PLaG works well off-the-shelf without fine-tuning.

- However, model performance still degrades drastically as task complexity increases, highlighting limits in using LLMs as digital devices or autonomous agents.

Main Contributions:
- New automated benchmark AsyncHow for asynchronous planning 

- Novel prompting technique PLaG that combines graphs and language to boost LLM performance

- Large-scale study showing LLMs still struggle with increasing complexity in planning tasks, indicating more progress needed to use them for simulation.

In summary, the paper introduces an asynchronous planning benchmark and graph-enhanced prompting technique to evaluate LLMs, revealing promising capabilities but also clear limits in complex planning that need to be addressed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces a new benchmark for assessing large language models on asynchronous planning tasks, proposes a novel graph-based prompting method that boosts performance, and analyzes model capabilities and limitations as planning complexity increases.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors automatically generate a new benchmark dataset called AsyncHow for evaluating large language models on asynchronous plan reasoning tasks. This dataset contains 1.6k high-quality instances.

2. The authors show that without detailed illustrations about how to solve the tasks, large language models including state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 perform poorly on the AsyncHow benchmark. 

3. They propose a novel prompting technique called Plan Like a Graph (PLaG) that combines graphs with natural language prompts. PLaG boosts the performance of all tested language models and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the AsyncHow benchmark when applied to GPT-4.

4. Despite the performance improvements from PLaG, the authors find that language models still suffer from drastic performance degradation as the complexity of the planning tasks increases. This highlights the limits of using large language models as efficient autonomous agents or digital devices.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) a new benchmark for asynchronous plan reasoning, (2) showing limits of LLMs on this task, (3) proposing a method that boosts LLM performance, and (4) analyzing factors that influence LLM performance on planning.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the proposed Plan Like a Graph (PLaG) method convert natural language planning tasks into equivalent graph problems? What are the key steps involved?

2. The paper shows PLaG boosts performance across task complexity levels. Does PLaG help more with simple or complex tasks? What might explain this effect?  

3. The paper introduces both an explicit graph version of PLaG and a Build a Graph (BaG) version. What are the key differences between these two variants and why might BaG perform slightly better?

4. What graph representations are used with PLaG in the experiments (e.g. adjacency list)? Do different models have preferences for different graph types when using PLaG?

5. How does the concept of the "language divide" that models experience relate to why PLaG is effective? Does PLaG help bridge this divide?  

6. Could PLaG be applicable to other language tasks beyond planning where introducing structure would be beneficial? What might some examples be?

7. The complexity measure used in the paper correlates well with model performance. Why is this an important validation of the complexity metric? How was this metric derived?  

8. What were some key limitations of using LLMs for planning tasks identified in the analysis? Do the results suggest limits to using LLMs as digital devices?

9. How exactly does the prototypical vs naturalistic splitting of experiments help analyze model performance? What trends were revealed in the out-of-distribution probing?

10. Qualitative analysis revealed LLMs still struggle with some easy instances. What are some examples of errors even capable models make? Why do these types of mistakes occur?
