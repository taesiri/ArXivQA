# [A Graph is Worth $K$ Words: Euclideanizing Graph using Pure Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02464)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Graph is Worth $K$ Words: Euclideanizing Graph using Pure Transformer":

Problem: 
- Graphs are non-Euclidean data structures which poses challenges for graph modeling using transformers, unlike the success of transformers in computer vision and NLP. Specifically, there are three main challenges:
	1) Generation Challenge: When generating new nodes/edges, the full graph structure changes, requiring complete recomputation of embeddings. Additionally, predicting edges requires search over a huge space.  
	2) Non-Euclidean Challenge: Lack of Euclidean prototypes to fully describe non-Euclidean graphs poses difficulties for graph manipulation/mixing.
	3) Representation Challenge: Graph SSL methods focus on sub-graph reconstruction, lacking ability to capture global topology.

Proposed Solution:
- Present GraphsGPT, comprising Graph2Seq encoder and GraphGPT decoder, to transform non-Euclidean graphs into Euclidean "graph words" while retaining information equivalence.
- Graph2Seq utilizes pure transformer to encode graph into sequence of learnable graph word tokens, eliminating need to explicitly encode adjacency matrix. Uses learnable codebook and shuffle strategy to handle large graphs.
- GraphGPT is a GPT-style decoder that auto-regressively reconstructs original graph from graph words. Key innovations:
	1) Edge-centric generation: Jointly generate edges and endpoint nodes to simplify search space.
	2) Block-wise causal attention for auto-regressive generation.
	3) Self-supervised training by reconstructing graphs.
	
Main Contributions:	
- Graph2Seq effectively learns graph representations, achieving SOTA on 8/9 graph regression/classification tasks.
- Pretrained GraphGPT serves as strong graph generator, enabling both unconditional and conditional generation.
- Graph words bridge gap between non-Euclidean graphs and Euclidean space, enabling graph manipulation like mixing/editing within latent space.
- Edge-centric GPT pretraining is a simple yet effective graph learner, underscoring its utility in representation and generation.

In summary, GraphsGPT innovatively uses pure transformers to convert non-Euclidean graphs to Euclidean graph words while retaining information, overcoming multiple challenges and achieving SOTA across representation and generation. The framework connects graph modeling with sequence modeling and provides opportunities for graph editing/mixing.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes GraphsGPT, a framework with a Graph2Seq encoder to convert non-Euclidean graphs into Euclidean "graph words" and a GraphGPT decoder to reconstruct the original graphs, for both graph representation learning and generation through self-supervised pre-training on molecules.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing GraphsGPT, a pure transformer model that can convert non-Euclidean graphs into Euclidean graph word representations while retaining the full information of the original graph structure. 

Specifically, GraphsGPT consists of two components:

1) Graph2Seq - An encoder that transforms a graph into a sequence of fixed-length, ordered graph words (vectors) in a Euclidean space.

2) GraphGPT - A GPT-style decoder that can reconstruct the original non-Euclidean graph from the graph words in an auto-regressive manner. This ensures the graph words encode all necessary information of the graph.

The key innovations include:

- Proposing the first pure transformer that can fully model graphs without needing complex positional encodings or attention mechanisms.

- An edge-centric graph generation strategy and block-wise causal attention to enable auto-regressive graph generation. 

- Demonstrating the graph words allow effective graph manipulation in the Euclidean space, overcoming known challenges with operating directly on non-Euclidean graphs.

Through extensive experiments, GraphsGPT is shown to achieve state-of-the-art graph representation learning and graph generation capabilities when pretrained on large molecule graphs.
