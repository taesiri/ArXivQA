# [Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation Meets Masked Modeling:Fine-grained   Locality Learning Matters in Consistency Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08631)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MaskMatch, a novel semi-supervised learning framework for semantic segmentation. The key insight is that existing consistency regularization methods originally designed for image classification struggle with satisfactory segmentation of local regions. To address this, MaskMatch incorporates two strategies for enhanced fine-grained locality learning: (1) A local consistency regularization (LCR) branch based on an auxiliary masked modeling proxy task, which encourages the model to perform complete segmentation given only unmasked image patches, thus requiring stronger locality perception ability. (2) A multi-scale ensembling strategy to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels that consider context at different levels of abstraction. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate MaskMatch's superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods, especially when labeled data is extremely scarce. The proposed techniques bring significant gains without extra parameters or backbone modification, ensuring plug-and-play flexibility. Analysis shows both LCR and multi-scale ensembling contribute to improved boundary segmentation performance, validating MaskMatch's strength in fine-grained locality learning.
