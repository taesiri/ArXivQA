# [Small Language Model Meets with Reinforced Vision Vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12503)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Large vision language models (LVLMs) like Vary and Flamingo require heavy parameters (7B+) and computing resources, hindering participation from researchers with limited resources.  
- Existing vision vocabularies in LVLMs do not fully utilize network capacity and lack efficiency in encoding rich visual information.

Proposed Solution - Vary-Toy:
- Proposes a small 1.8B parameter Vary-Toy LVLM that can be trained on a single GTX1080ti GPU.
- Generates a new reinforced vision vocabulary using the Vary-Tiny+ pipeline, incorporating dense text and natural object location data. This improves efficiency in encoding visual information.
- Integrates the new vision vocabulary with CLIP into the 1.8B Qwen language model to create Vary-Toy.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a small, open source 1.8B LVLM called Vary-Toy that matches performance of heavier 7B+ models on tasks like DocVQA and RefCOCO.
- Reinforces vision vocabulary to better retain natural image perception abilities using object detection data, improving encoding efficiency.
- Demonstrates exceptional performance of a small LVLM on challenging vision-language tasks, encouraging more participation from resource-limited researchers.
- Provides strong baseline and vision vocabulary generation pipeline for future small LVLMs research.

In summary, the paper presents Vary-Toy, an open source 1.8B LVLM with reinforced vision vocabulary that achieves impressive performance on multiple vision-language tasks using limited compute. It enables more researchers to experiment in this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Vary-toy, a small 1.8B parameter vision-language model that achieves strong performance on document understanding, object detection, and general tasks by incorporating a reinforced vision vocabulary.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes Vary-toy, a small 1.8B parameter vision-language model that can run on a single GTX1080ti GPU while achieving strong performance comparable to or better than some 7B+ models on tasks like document understanding, chart understanding, object detection, and general capabilities.

2) It introduces an improved method for generating the vision vocabulary using both dense text (PDF) data and natural object location data, allowing the model to encode both types of visual information efficiently. 

3) Experiments show Vary-toy achieves 65.6% on DocVQA, 59.1% on ChartQA, 88.1% on RefCOCO, and 29% on MMVet, demonstrating its effectiveness as a small but powerful LVLM baseline.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an efficient way to build a cost-effective yet high-performing LVLM that can serve as an easily accessible baseline for researchers.
