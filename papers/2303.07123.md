# [Modality-Agnostic Debiasing for Single Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07123)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a versatile and modality-agnostic framework for single domain generalization (single-DG) that can effectively generalize to multiple unseen domains across different data modalities like images, texts, and point clouds. The key hypothesis is that directly enhancing the classifier's ability to identify domain-specific features while emphasizing the learning of domain-generalized features can enable effective single-DG without relying on modality-specific data augmentations.In particular, the paper proposes a Modality-Agnostic Debiasing (MAD) framework with a novel two-branch classifier structure to identify domain-specific features in one branch and capture domain-generalized features in the other branch. The goal is to develop a generalized and versatile solution for single-DG that works across modalities. The central hypothesis is that the proposed MAD framework can outperform existing modality-specific single-DG methods and generalize well to unseen domains of different data types like images, texts, point clouds, etc.
