# [Modality-Agnostic Debiasing for Single Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07123)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a versatile and modality-agnostic framework for single domain generalization (single-DG) that can effectively generalize to multiple unseen domains across different data modalities like images, texts, and point clouds. The key hypothesis is that directly enhancing the classifier's ability to identify domain-specific features while emphasizing the learning of domain-generalized features can enable effective single-DG without relying on modality-specific data augmentations.In particular, the paper proposes a Modality-Agnostic Debiasing (MAD) framework with a novel two-branch classifier structure to identify domain-specific features in one branch and capture domain-generalized features in the other branch. The goal is to develop a generalized and versatile solution for single-DG that works across modalities. The central hypothesis is that the proposed MAD framework can outperform existing modality-specific single-DG methods and generalize well to unseen domains of different data types like images, texts, point clouds, etc.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a versatile and modality-agnostic framework called Modality-Agnostic Debiasing (MAD) for single domain generalization (single-DG). The key points are:- Existing single-DG methods typically introduce modality-specific data augmentation techniques like style transfer to encourage learning of domain-generalized features. However, they are limited to a single modality like images. - This paper proposes a new approach to strengthen classifier's ability to identify domain-specific features and emphasize learning of domain-generalized features. This eliminates need for modality-specific data augmentation.- MAD has a two-branch classifier - biased branch to identify domain-specific features, and general branch that learns domain-generalized features using knowledge from biased branch.- MAD can be incorporated into existing single-DG methods to boost performance, without increasing inference cost.- MAD is evaluated on single-DG tasks with different modalities - 1D text, 2D images, 3D point clouds, and 2D image segmentation. It improves state-of-the-art in all tasks.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a versatile and modality-agnostic framework MAD that strengthens identification of domain-specific features and learning of domain-generalized features for single-DG. This eliminates need for modality-specific data augmentation.
