# [Right on Time: Revising Time Series Models by Constraining their   Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12921)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Right on Time: Revising Time Series Models by Constraining their Explanations":

Problem:
- Time series models like deep neural networks are prone to relying on confounding factors in the data instead of the actual signal. This can lead to misleading predictions that fail to generalize.
- Confounding factors in time series data can occur both in the time domain (certain time steps) as well as the frequency domain (certain frequencies). 
- Existing methods to mitigate confounders make specific assumptions and are not generally applicable.
- There is a lack of real-world time series datasets with annotated confounders to evaluate methods on.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose RioT (Right on Time), a method that enables interaction with time series model explanations to steer the model away from confounding factors.
- RioT generates explanations of the model's predictions using Integrated Gradients. It allows expert feedback on the explanations to identify potential confounding factors.
- The key novelty is that RioT incorporates feedback not only in the time domain but also the frequency domain using Fourier Transforms. This allows mitigating confounders even if they are not pinpointable in time.
- The feedback is integrated into the model training via a "right-reason" loss term that guides the model to focus less on marked confounding factors.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of RioT, the first XAI method for time series that can mitigate confounders in both time and frequency domain via expert feedback.
- New real-world dataset "P2S" from an industrial production line with annotated confounders to evaluate methods on real-world scenarios.
- Empirical demonstration that RioT can effectively mitigate spatial and frequency confounders on P2S and other benchmark datasets for time series classification and forecasting.
- Showcasing that feedback in the frequency domain is pivotal to handle confounders that are not locatable in time.

The paper makes an important contribution towards more reliable and transparent time series models by developing a practical method to overcome sensitivity to confounding factors. The ability to incorporate expert knowledge is key to successful application and generalization.
