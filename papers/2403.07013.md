# [AdaNovo: Adaptive \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing with Conditional   Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- De novo peptide sequencing from tandem mass spectra is challenging. Existing methods struggle to identify amino acids with post-translational modifications (PTMs) and are sensitive to noise in the spectral data. This limits their accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose AdaNovo, a new framework to adaptively train the model by calculating conditional mutual information (CMI) between the spectrum and each amino acid. 

- Two CMI metrics are used - amino acid-level CMI between each amino acid and the spectrum, and PSM-level CMI between the entire peptide sequence and spectrum.

- These CMI metrics allow adaptive re-weighting of the loss for each amino acid during training to emphasize important ones.

- AdaNovo has a spectral encoder module and two peptide decoder modules. One decoder is used to calculate CMI.

Contributions:

- AdaNovo achieves state-of-the-art performance on a 9-species peptide sequencing benchmark, improving both amino acid-level and peptide-level precision.

- It identifies amino acids with PTMs much more accurately than previous methods by emphasizing them during training.

- The PSM-level adaptive training makes it more robust to noise in the spectral data.

- Ablation studies demonstrate that both amino acid-level and PSM-level adaptive training contribute to AdaNovo's strong performance.

In summary, AdaNovo advances the state-of-the-art in de novo peptide sequencing by an adaptive training approach based on conditional mutual information between spectra and amino acids. This allows it to better handle amino acids with PTMs and spectral noise.
