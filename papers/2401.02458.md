## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Data-Centric Foundation Models in Computational Healthcare: A Survey":

Problem
The paper discusses the key challenges in applying foundation models (FMs) to healthcare, which are powerful large neural network models pre-trained on massive amounts of data. Specifically, it focuses on data-related challenges in healthcare such as limited data quantity and quality, high annotation cost, data privacy concerns, and multi-modality data fusion. For example, medical data like imaging and text records tend to be scarce and fragmented across institutions. Annotating medical data is expensive and time-consuming due to the required domain expertise. Patient privacy also needs careful protection when sharing and analyzing healthcare data. Furthermore, medical data comes in complex multi-modal forms like images, text, and biosensors signals, requiring effective data fusion techniques.  

Solutions
The paper summarizes recent advances in addressing these healthcare data challenges using FMs. Strategies include data augmentation via generative models like diffusion models and LLMs to increase data quantity and diversity. Data efficiency techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning and continual learning enable FMs to work well even with limited downstream data. Large-scale Internet data curation from sources like PMC articles and online consultation platforms supports pre-training robust healthcare FMs. Multi-modal FMs like CLIP are pre-trained on paired data like images and radiology reports for better joint understanding. Powerful reasoning of LLMs also facilitates multi-modal data fusion. For privacy, FMs can generate synthetic data containing no real patient information. The paper also discusses evaluation, regulation, bias mitigation, and human alignment to promote safe FM usage in healthcare.   

Main Contributions 
(1) It provides a broad overview of the healthcare data challenges like quantity, annotation, privacy, and multi-modality fusion.
(2) It comprehensively summarizes the recent progress in addressing these medical data challenges using data-centric techniques empowered by foundation models. 
(3) It discusses opportunities and open problems in developing robust and trustworthy healthcare-focused foundation models, highlighting model evaluation, regulation, bias mitigation, and human alignment.

Overall, this paper offers key insights into data-related opportunities and risks regarding the application of foundation models to enhance various aspects of computational healthcare.
