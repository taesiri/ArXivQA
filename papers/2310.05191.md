# [FABRIC: Automated Scoring and Feedback Generation for Essays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing automated essay scoring (AES) models provide overall scores but lack specific rubric-based scores and actionable feedback to help students improve their writing. This is insufficient for both students and instructors.
- There is a lack of publicly available rubric-based AES datasets due to variability in rubrics across different datasets. This hinders research progress. 

Proposed Solution - FABRIC Pipeline:
1) DREsS Dataset:
- New real-world dataset of 1,782 essays scored by experts based on standard rubrics of content, organization and language.

2) CASE Augmentation Strategy:  
- Novel corruption-based data augmentation method that injects sentence-level errors into essays to create synthetic training data tailored for each rubric.

3) EssayCoT Feedback Generation:
- Prompting strategy that utilizes predicted AES rubric scores to guide an LLM to generate more helpful and relevant feedback.

Key Contributions:
- Release of DREsS, a real-world rubric-based AES dataset to facilitate research 
- Introduction of CASE, which significantly boosts AES model performance
- Proposal of EssayCoT that generates preferred feedback over standard prompting 
- Presentation of complete FABRIC pipeline from scoring to tailored feedback generation evaluated in real classrooms

The paper aims to advance innovations in AI for English writing education through standardized datasets, tailored NLP models, and purposeful human-AI interaction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1) Proposing a new dataset called DREsS for rubric-based essay scoring, which includes real essays from EFL learners scored by experts according to content, organization, and language rubrics. 

2) Introducing a corruption-based data augmentation strategy called CASE to generate synthetic training data for the AES models. This improves model performance significantly.

3) Proposing a new essay feedback generation task on top of AES, to provide more detailed and helpful feedback to students beyond just a score. 

4) Introducing a prompting strategy called EssayCoT that utilizes the predicted AES scores to generate better, more accurate feedback compared to standard prompting without scores.

5) Presenting an end-to-end pipeline called FABRIC that integrates rubric-based AES models and the EssayCoT feedback generation to provide scores and feedback on essays to assist EFL learners and instructors.

In summary, the key contributions are the new dataset, augmentation strategy, EssayCoT prompting, and the full FABRIC pipeline for advancing automated essay scoring and feedback generation to support English writing education.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Automated essay scoring (AES)
- Rubric-based scoring
- Feedback generation
- EFL (English as a Foreign Language) writing education
- DREsS dataset
- CASE (Corruption-based Augmentation Strategy for Essays)  
- EssayCoT (Essay Chain-of-Thought) prompting
- Content, organization, language rubrics
- Helpfulness, relevance, accuracy of feedback

The paper introduces a pipeline called FABRIC for automated scoring and feedback generation for essays to assist EFL learners and instructors. It makes contributions in releasing a new real-world dataset called DREsS, proposing data augmentation strategies for AES models, and introducing a prompting approach called EssayCoT to generate better essay feedback. The scoring rubrics focused on are content, organization and language. The quality of the AI-generated feedback is evaluated based on criteria like helpfulness and relevance. So these would be some of the key terms associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called DREsS. What are some key features of this dataset compared to existing AES datasets like ASAP or ICNALE? How was it collected and annotated?  

2. The paper proposes a corruption-based data augmentation strategy called CASE. Can you explain in more detail the specific strategies used for corrupting content, organization, and language? How were the optimal levels of corruption determined?

3. The EssayCoT prompting strategy is introduced to generate better feedback by incorporating predicted essay scores. How exactly does providing the rubric scores help improve the quality and relevance of the feedback compared to standard prompting without scores?

4. The paper evaluates the AES model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) score. Why was this metric chosen over other scoring metrics? What are its advantages and disadvantages?  

5. In the user study with students, how did the paper ensure there was no bias or influence on students' actual essay scores or grades from using the AI scoring and feedback system?  

6. Could the CASE data augmentation strategy be applied to other NLP tasks beyond automated essay scoring? What modifications might need to be made?

7. The human evaluation results show EssayCoT feedback was preferred over standard prompting. Was any analysis done on the generated feedback to understand why exactly it was more helpful and relevant?  

8. What efforts were made to ensure diversity among the student essays collected in the DREsS dataset in terms of topic, style, demographic factors etc?  

9. Could the EssayCoT strategy be expanded to incorporate other information beyond just the rubric scores to improve feedback quality further? What other inputs might be useful?

10. The paper focuses on evaluating score accuracy and feedback quality. For practical use, how fast and scalable is the overall pipeline? Could it be deployed for real-time essay scoring and feedback in the classroom?
