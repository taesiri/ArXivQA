# [FABRIC: Automated Scoring and Feedback Generation for Essays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05191)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing automated essay scoring (AES) models provide overall scores but lack specific rubric-based scores and actionable feedback to help students improve their writing. This is insufficient for both students and instructors.
- There is a lack of publicly available rubric-based AES datasets due to variability in rubrics across different datasets. This hinders research progress. 

Proposed Solution - FABRIC Pipeline:
1) DREsS Dataset:
- New real-world dataset of 1,782 essays scored by experts based on standard rubrics of content, organization and language.

2) CASE Augmentation Strategy:  
- Novel corruption-based data augmentation method that injects sentence-level errors into essays to create synthetic training data tailored for each rubric.

3) EssayCoT Feedback Generation:
- Prompting strategy that utilizes predicted AES rubric scores to guide an LLM to generate more helpful and relevant feedback.

Key Contributions:
- Release of DREsS, a real-world rubric-based AES dataset to facilitate research 
- Introduction of CASE, which significantly boosts AES model performance
- Proposal of EssayCoT that generates preferred feedback over standard prompting 
- Presentation of complete FABRIC pipeline from scoring to tailored feedback generation evaluated in real classrooms

The paper aims to advance innovations in AI for English writing education through standardized datasets, tailored NLP models, and purposeful human-AI interaction.
