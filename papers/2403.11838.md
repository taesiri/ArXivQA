# [Ensuring Safe and High-Quality Outputs: A Guideline Library Approach for   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can generate impressive and useful outputs, but also pose risks like biased or unsafe content. 
- Current alignment techniques face limitations:
  - Manually written rules have limited precision and comprehensiveness.  
  - Models without safety training lack sufficient risk perception to identify problematic inputs.

Proposed Solution: "\approach" 
- Constructs a comprehensive, customized guideline library using a safety-trained LLM to analyze inputs and formulate tailored guidelines.
- Trains an input-guideline retrieval model to match new inputs to relevant guidelines. 
- Uses retrieved guidelines to guide LLM response generation, ensuring safety and quality.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces the novel \approach method for aligning LLMs with human values by utilizing custom guideline library and retrieval model.
- Provides a plug-and-play module to improve LLM safety and quality.
- Constructs new well-aligned dataset and fine-tunes \model LLM, which demonstrates strong performance exceeding GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 alignment capabilities.  

The paper addresses limitations around precision, comprehensiveness and risk perception in existing techniques through automated guideline generation and retrieval. The proposed \approach framework and resulting resources significantly advance LLM alignment with human values.
