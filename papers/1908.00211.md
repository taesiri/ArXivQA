# Generative Image Inpainting with Submanifold Alignment

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the structural and textural consistency of images generated by GAN-based image inpainting models. Specifically, the paper proposes using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the alignment between data submanifolds of restored/generated images and original images. It develops two LID-based regularizations - image-level (iLID) and patch-level (pLID) - to encourage submanifold alignment during GAN training. This is aimed at improving the consistency between restored contents and surrounding image contexts.The key hypothesis is that enforcing submanifold alignment through iLID and pLID regularizations will allow GAN inpainting models to generate more realistic and consistent image restorations. Experiments on benchmark datasets verify that the proposed approach reduces structural and textural inconsistencies compared to state-of-the-art models.In summary, the paper focuses on improving GAN inpainting through novel regularizations based on submanifold alignment measured by LID, in order to address the problem of inconsistency in current models. The central hypothesis is that aligning data submanifolds will lead to more consistent image generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing to use Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the alignment between data submanifolds of restored images/patches and original images/patches in image inpainting. Based on this, the authors develop two LID-based regularization terms - image-level (iLID) and patch-level (pLID) submanifold alignment regularizations - to improve the training of GAN-based inpainting models. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Generalizing the use of LID to measure submanifold alignment in image inpainting. - Proposing iLID regularization to enforce alignment between submanifolds of restored and original images to improve structural consistency.- Proposing pLID regularization to enforce alignment between submanifolds of restored and original patches to improve textural details.- Showing experimentally that adding these regularizations to GAN-based inpainting models improves results and reduces structural/textural inconsistencies compared to state-of-the-art methods.So in summary, the core contribution is using LID to quantify and optimize submanifold alignment in image inpainting via new regularization terms, which helps improve inpainting results.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in the field of image inpainting:- The main focus of this paper is on improving structural and textural consistency in GAN-based image inpainting models. Many previous works like Context Encoder, GntIpt, GMCNN, etc. have generated promising results but still suffer from inconsistency issues. - The key idea proposed is to enforce alignment of data submanifolds between restored and original images using the Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) measure. This is a novel use of LID in the context of inpainting. Prior works have not explicitly exploited submanifold alignment.- Two LID-based regularizations are introduced - iLID for image-level alignment and pLID for patch-level alignment. This provides a multi-level alignment strategy to improve both structural and textural consistency.- Most prior works use a two-stage coarse-to-fine approach which can propagate errors from the coarse stage. This paper proposes to integrate the submanifold alignment within the GAN training process itself.- Experiments show superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods like CE, GL, GntIpt, GMCNN across multiple datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.Overall, the key novelty of this work is the use of submanifold alignment regularizations with LID to address consistency issues in a principled manner within GAN-based inpainting. The multi-level alignment strategy and results demonstrate clear improvements over existing approaches.
