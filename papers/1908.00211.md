# [Generative Image Inpainting with Submanifold Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00211)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the structural and textural consistency of images generated by GAN-based image inpainting models. Specifically, the paper proposes using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the alignment between data submanifolds of restored/generated images and original images. It develops two LID-based regularizations - image-level (iLID) and patch-level (pLID) - to encourage submanifold alignment during GAN training. This is aimed at improving the consistency between restored contents and surrounding image contexts.The key hypothesis is that enforcing submanifold alignment through iLID and pLID regularizations will allow GAN inpainting models to generate more realistic and consistent image restorations. Experiments on benchmark datasets verify that the proposed approach reduces structural and textural inconsistencies compared to state-of-the-art models.In summary, the paper focuses on improving GAN inpainting through novel regularizations based on submanifold alignment measured by LID, in order to address the problem of inconsistency in current models. The central hypothesis is that aligning data submanifolds will lead to more consistent image generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing to use Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the alignment between data submanifolds of restored images/patches and original images/patches in image inpainting. Based on this, the authors develop two LID-based regularization terms - image-level (iLID) and patch-level (pLID) submanifold alignment regularizations - to improve the training of GAN-based inpainting models. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Generalizing the use of LID to measure submanifold alignment in image inpainting. - Proposing iLID regularization to enforce alignment between submanifolds of restored and original images to improve structural consistency.- Proposing pLID regularization to enforce alignment between submanifolds of restored and original patches to improve textural details.- Showing experimentally that adding these regularizations to GAN-based inpainting models improves results and reduces structural/textural inconsistencies compared to state-of-the-art methods.So in summary, the core contribution is using LID to quantify and optimize submanifold alignment in image inpainting via new regularization terms, which helps improve inpainting results.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in the field of image inpainting:- The main focus of this paper is on improving structural and textural consistency in GAN-based image inpainting models. Many previous works like Context Encoder, GntIpt, GMCNN, etc. have generated promising results but still suffer from inconsistency issues. - The key idea proposed is to enforce alignment of data submanifolds between restored and original images using the Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) measure. This is a novel use of LID in the context of inpainting. Prior works have not explicitly exploited submanifold alignment.- Two LID-based regularizations are introduced - iLID for image-level alignment and pLID for patch-level alignment. This provides a multi-level alignment strategy to improve both structural and textural consistency.- Most prior works use a two-stage coarse-to-fine approach which can propagate errors from the coarse stage. This paper proposes to integrate the submanifold alignment within the GAN training process itself.- Experiments show superior performance over several state-of-the-art methods like CE, GL, GntIpt, GMCNN across multiple datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.Overall, the key novelty of this work is the use of submanifold alignment regularizations with LID to address consistency issues in a principled manner within GAN-based inpainting. The multi-level alignment strategy and results demonstrate clear improvements over existing approaches.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Applying the proposed submanifold alignment regularizations to other GAN-based inpainting models besides the ones tested in the paper. The authors note that their enhancements could likely improve other models, so analyzing this further would be interesting future work.- Investigating the effects of using different network architectures or trained networks for extracting the deep features used in computing iLID and pLID. The authors used VGG19 features in their experiments, but features from other networks may provide useful comparisons.- Exploring other ways to characterize or measure the alignment between data submanifolds, beyond the LID-based measures proposed. There may be other techniques from dimensionality reduction or manifold learning that could be adapted.- Evaluating the inpainting models on a wider range of datasets and corruption types. The authors tested on four image datasets with rectangular mask corruption. Testing on other datasets and corruption masks (irregular shapes, scattered pixels, etc) could further analyze the robustness.- Modifying the loss functions or network architectures to better optimize the submanifold alignment. The regularization terms were simply added to existing GAN losses in this work, but structures optimized specifically for alignment may further improve results.- Extending the submanifold alignment idea to other image generation tasks beyond inpainting, such as super-resolution, denoising, etc. The principle of matching submanifolds could apply broadly to generate consistent results.So in summary, the authors point to several worthwhile directions for extending the submanifold alignment approach to other models, tasks, datasets, and training mechanisms in future works. The core idea seems promising for improving deep generative models in general.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new generative image inpainting model with submanifold alignment to address structural and textural inconsistencies in current GAN-based inpainting models. The key idea is to enforce alignment between the local data submanifolds around restored images/patches and those around original images/patches during GAN training, using a dimensionality measure called Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). Specifically, the authors develop an image-level LID (iLID) to measure submanifold alignment for improving structural consistency, and a patch-level LID (pLID) for improving textural details. These are incorporated as regularizations into the GAN training loss. Experiments on benchmark datasets show the proposed model achieves more accurate inpainting results compared to state-of-the-art models. The main contributions are proposing the use of LID for submanifold alignment in inpainting, developing the iLID and pLID regularizations, and demonstrating improved performance.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a new inpainting model to address the structural and textural inconsistency issues in current GAN-based inpainting models. The key idea is to enforce alignment between the local data submanifolds around restored images/patches and those around original images/patches. To achieve this, the authors exploit Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the closeness of submanifolds in deep feature space from two perspectives - image-level (iLID) and patch-level (pLID). The image-level measure characterizes overall structural consistency while the patch-level measure focuses on textural details. These two LID-based measures are incorporated as regularizations into the GAN training process. Specifically, the overall training loss becomes a weighted combination of an adversarial loss, a reconstruction loss, the iLID regularization term, and the pLID regularization term. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can generate more structurally and texturally consistent inpainting results compared to state-of-the-art models.In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions:1) It proposes the novel use of LID to measure submanifold alignment in image inpainting. 2) It develops iLID and pLID regularizations to improve structural and textural consistency of GAN-based inpainting.3) Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the model in reducing inconsistency and improving inpainting accuracy over existing methods.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes to use Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the alignment or closeness between the local data submanifolds around restored images and those around the original images. Specifically, the authors develop two LID-based regularizations for GAN image inpainting models: (1) Image-level LID (iLID) which computes the LID of an original image based on its nearest neighbors in the GAN-generated samples, to encourage structural consistency; (2) Patch-level LID (pLID) which computes LID of original patches based on restored patches, to improve textural details. These two regularizations enforce submanifold alignment at both the image and patch levels during GAN training. The overall training loss combines an adversarial loss, a reconstruction loss, iLID regularization, and pLID regularization. Experiments show this method reduces structural and textural inconsistencies compared to existing inpainting models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the problem of structural and textural inconsistency in current GAN-based image inpainting models. Specifically, it points out two key limitations of existing models:1. The commonly used loss functions (reconstruction + adversarial) do not provide an explicit regularization for structural and textural consistency. 2. Existing two-stage models that refine a coarse inpainting result using nearest neighbor patch replacement tend to produce repetitive patterns and alter structures.To address these limitations, the key idea proposed in the paper is to enforce the alignment or closeness between the data submanifolds around restored images/patches and original images/patches during GAN training. This is achieved using two regularizers based on Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to encourage submanifold alignment at both the image level and the patch level.So in summary, the paper aims to improve structural and textural consistency in GAN-based inpainting by exploiting LID to measure and align local data submanifolds of restored and original image content during training.
