# Generative Image Inpainting with Submanifold Alignment

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve the structural and textural consistency of images generated by GAN-based image inpainting models. Specifically, the paper proposes using Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) to measure the alignment between data submanifolds of restored/generated images and original images. It develops two LID-based regularizations - image-level (iLID) and patch-level (pLID) - to encourage submanifold alignment during GAN training. This is aimed at improving the consistency between restored contents and surrounding image contexts.The key hypothesis is that enforcing submanifold alignment through iLID and pLID regularizations will allow GAN inpainting models to generate more realistic and consistent image restorations. Experiments on benchmark datasets verify that the proposed approach reduces structural and textural inconsistencies compared to state-of-the-art models.In summary, the paper focuses on improving GAN inpainting through novel regularizations based on submanifold alignment measured by LID, in order to address the problem of inconsistency in current models. The central hypothesis is that aligning data submanifolds will lead to more consistent image generation.
