# [CLSA-CIM: A Cross-Layer Scheduling Approach for Computing-in-Memory   Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of demand for efficient machine learning acceleration has spurred the development of novel computing concepts such as RRAM-based tiled computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures. CIM allows computation directly in the memory unit, accelerating data processing and reducing power consumption. For CIM architectures, efficient compiler algorithms are essential to exploit the architecture's potential, especially in utilizing the processing elements (PE). Conventional ML compilers mainly focus on CPUs and GPUs, so adaptations are needed for CIM. Cross-layer scheduling is a promising approach as it improves the utilization of CIM cores, speeding up computations. Although some previous work has implicitly used related concepts, there is a lack of clear algorithmic definitions for cross-layer scheduling tailored to tiled CIM architectures.

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents CLSA-CIM, a new cross-layer scheduling algorithm for tiled CIM architectures. CLSA-CIM seamlessly integrates with existing mapping strategies like weight duplication and leverages established intra-layer scheduling techniques. It aims to maximize CIM core utilization and minimize inference latency. The algorithm comprises four key stages - determine sets, determine dependencies, intra-layer scheduling, and cross-layer scheduling. Weight duplication and CLSA-CIM can be combined, allowing further inference acceleration.

Main Contributions:
1) Extension of weight duplication approaches by developing an algorithm to duplicate the optimal parts of the neural network to minimize inference latency
2) Introduction of CLSA-CIM - the first detailed cross-layer scheduling algorithm designed specifically for tiled CIM architectures 
3) A case study demonstrating that CLSA-CIM achieves up to 29.2x speedup by significantly improving PE utilization

In summary, this paper makes important contributions towards advanced scheduling algorithms that can unlock the potential of emerging CIM architectures for efficient ML acceleration. The proposed CLSA-CIM algorithm and its seamless integration with techniques like weight duplication pave the way for enhanced performance.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of CLSA-CIM, a novel cross-layer scheduling approach for tiled computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures. Specifically:

- CLSA-CIM enables cross-layer inference on top of existing intra-layer scheduling and weight duplication mapping algorithms. This significantly enhances the utilization of processing elements (PEs) in CIM architectures, resulting in faster inference.

- In evaluations using state-of-the-art neural networks, CLSA-CIM achieved up to 17.9x higher PE utilization compared to layer-by-layer scheduling, translating to an inference speedup of up to 29.2x.

- The paper demonstrates the benefits of combining cross-layer scheduling with weight duplication mapping to further reduce inference latency. 

- The approach is generic and can be integrated with different CIM architectures that meet the outlined prerequisites (tiled structure, parallel tiles, buffers, etc.).

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of CLSA-CIM as a novel and efficient cross-layer scheduling technique for accelerated inference on tiled CIM architectures.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the cross-layer scheduling approach proposed in the paper:

1) The paper mentions that cross-layer scheduling is particularly well-suited for RRAM-based CIM architectures due to their weight-stationary data flow. Can you expand on why this architecture enables more efficient cross-layer scheduling compared to other CIM architectures? 

2) The CLSA-CIM algorithm has four main stages - high-level optimizations, determine sets, determine dependencies, and scheduling. Can you walk through these stages in more detail, especially the determine dependencies stage, and explain how they enable effective cross-layer scheduling?

3) Weight duplication and cross-layer scheduling can be combined to further reduce inference latency. However, there may be hardware costs associated with enabling both techniques. What architectural considerations need to be made to efficiently support both concepts?

4) The paper evaluates CLSA-CIM using an abstract simulation model. What are some specific architecture-dependent factors, such as data movement costs and resource sharing constraints, that should be modeled to get a more accurate evaluation of algorithm performance?

5) How does the performance of CLSA-CIM scheduling scale with increased model complexity and depth? What Bottlenecks emerge for very deep neural networks?

6) Could the concepts proposed in this paper be applied to other novel computing architectures beyond RRAM-based CIM, such as optical computing? What architectural prerequisites need to be met?

7) The paper mentions a utilization wall below 10% for single NN inferences. What techniques could be used to improve utilization further for a single model? Could pipeline parallelism across models help?

8) The benchmarks used for evaluation are image-based models. Would CLSA-CIM generalize well to other data types like text or time series? Would any modifications be needed?

9) How does the performance compare to other cross-layer scheduling techniques proposed in literature? What unique advantages does CLSA-CIM provide over prior arts?

10) The paper focuses on inference only. Could similar concepts be applied to effectively map and schedule training workloads onto CIM architectures? What new challenges emerge in that scenario?
