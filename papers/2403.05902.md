# [MaiBaam Annotation Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05902)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Overview
- This paper provides annotation guidelines for the MaiBaam corpus, a Bavarian German treebank annotated with Universal Dependencies. 
- It covers decisions related to preprocessing, tokenization, part-of-speech tags, dependencies, and specific phenomena in Bavarian grammar.

Preprocessing and Tokenization
- Original formatting like italics and bold are removed. Lists are skipped unless they contain full sentences. 
- Typos and punctuation errors are preserved. Sentence splitting follows general guidelines. 
- Special German multiword tokens like fused prepositions and determiners are split (zum → zu + m).
- Personal names get a flat relation between determiner, family name and given name.

Part-of-Speech Tags 
- Follows general UD guidelines. modal particles are tagged as adverbs, not particles. Participles follow STTS verb vs adjective rules. 
- Anonymized names become PROPN, placeholders like "..." become SYM.

Dependencies
- Follows UD guidelines. Oblique arguments and adjuncts are obl. Auxiliary tua is added. 
- Apposition vs parataxis decisions follow rules on predicate, subject and clause structure.

Bavarian Phenomena
- Order variation with determiners and adverbs uses non-projective annotation. 
- Infinitive constructions distinguish verbal and nominal variants.
- Pronoun clitics are annotated as inflectional morphology on verbs/complementizers.
- Relative pronouns co-occur with invariable relative markers wie/wo/was.

The guidelines aim to cover common structures in a principled way to support consistent Corpus annotation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides annotation guidelines for the MaiBaam treebank, a corpus of Bavarian German texts annotated with Universal Dependencies (UD). The key contributions are:

1) The paper documents detailed decisions on how to handle various syntactic constructions in Bavarian when annotating them with UD, such as inflected complementizers, relative markers like "wo", noun phrase syntax, verb constructions, pronouns, etc. These decisions align with UD guidelines where possible but also elaborate on Bavarian-specific phenomena not covered in the general UD guidelines.

2) By publishing these guidelines, the authors not only provide instructions for current and future annotators of the MaiBaam treebank, but also allow others working with this data or on related dialects to better understand the annotations.

3) The guidelines highlight differences between Standard German and Bavarian syntax/morphology that are relevant for syntactic annotation. They provide examples from the MaiBaam data and link to external research on these language phenomena where applicable.

So in summary, the main contribution is a set of coherent, detailed and publicly available UD annotation guidelines tailored to the Bavarian dialect, with the goals of ensuring consistent treebank annotation and providing explanations of the MaiBaam analysis decisions to external researchers interested in their data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Bavarian (language/dialect)
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Dependency parsing
- Universal Dependencies
- Annotation guidelines
- Morphosyntax
- Clitics
- Relative clauses
- Copulas
- Infinitive constructions

The paper provides annotation guidelines for part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing of Bavarian, a family of dialects spoken in Bavaria, Germany. It elaborates on the general Universal Dependencies guidelines and German UD guidelines to account for some of the morphosyntactic peculiarities of Bavarian, such as clitic pronouns, complementizer agreement, relative clause constructions using invariant particles like "wo", and infinitive constructions with "z(u)". The guidelines cover decisions on tokenization, POS tags, dependency relations, and analyze linguistic phenomena such as pronouns, auxiliaries, noun phrases and verb phrases in Bavarian. So the key terms revolve around creating computational grammar resources for this dialect.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper provides guidelines for linguistically annotating a Bavarian corpus with part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependencies that build on the Universal Dependencies frameworks from a German language perspective, including annotation decisions addressing Bavarian-specific grammatical features such as clitic pronouns, infinitive markers, and relative clauses.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the annotation guidelines proposed in this paper:

1. The guidelines allow for non-projective syntactic annotations in certain Bavarian constructions like "a ganz a normales Wort" (section 4.1.1). What are the implications of this for developing parsers and other NLP tools that assume projectivity? How prevalent do you expect such constructions to be?

2. In deciding whether to analyze second person agreement markers on complementizers like "-sd" as inflection or clitics (section 4.2.1), what were the key theoretical linguistic arguments on each side that had to be weighed? What were the deciding practical factors in the annotation scheme?  

3. For the doubled first person plural marking with "-ma" (section 4.2.2), why is the analysis controversial regarding whether it should be treated as an inflectional ending or a clitic pronoun? What evidence exists on each side?

4. The guidelines prescribe using the relation appos for certain postponed adjective constructions (section 4.1.3). What other options were considered and what made appos the best fit over other potential relations?

5. In annotating partially case-syncretic dative/accusative articles and pronouns (section 4.1.2), what extra steps need to be taken to determine the proper grammatical function label? What sources of information are used to disambiguate these cases?  

6. Why is the relative pronoun "wo" analyzed as a subordinating conjunction marker rather than just a relative pronoun in parallel with languages like English (section 4.2.5)? What key properties differentiate it from a standard relative pronoun?

7. For book/song titles (section 3.10) in related languages/dialects, normal POS tags and syntax relations are used instead of uniform PROPN labels. What factors govern this decision and why is it superior for these Bavarian texts?

8. In the analysis of fused preposition+determiner sequences (section 2.3), what principles guided the tokenization and tagging decisions? Why are certain non-standard subtokenizations like "im" → "i m" permissible? 

9. Why are modal particles like "ja", "doch", etc. analyzed as adverbs rather than particles (section 3.6)? What competing analysis options were considered from other German treebanks?

10. How prevalent do you expect the additional "dass" complementizers in certain Bavarian subordinate clauses (section 4.2.4) to be? What challenges could they potentially pose for developing automatic parsers?
