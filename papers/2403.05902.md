# [MaiBaam Annotation Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05902)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Overview
- This paper provides annotation guidelines for the MaiBaam corpus, a Bavarian German treebank annotated with Universal Dependencies. 
- It covers decisions related to preprocessing, tokenization, part-of-speech tags, dependencies, and specific phenomena in Bavarian grammar.

Preprocessing and Tokenization
- Original formatting like italics and bold are removed. Lists are skipped unless they contain full sentences. 
- Typos and punctuation errors are preserved. Sentence splitting follows general guidelines. 
- Special German multiword tokens like fused prepositions and determiners are split (zum â†’ zu + m).
- Personal names get a flat relation between determiner, family name and given name.

Part-of-Speech Tags 
- Follows general UD guidelines. modal particles are tagged as adverbs, not particles. Participles follow STTS verb vs adjective rules. 
- Anonymized names become PROPN, placeholders like "..." become SYM.

Dependencies
- Follows UD guidelines. Oblique arguments and adjuncts are obl. Auxiliary tua is added. 
- Apposition vs parataxis decisions follow rules on predicate, subject and clause structure.

Bavarian Phenomena
- Order variation with determiners and adverbs uses non-projective annotation. 
- Infinitive constructions distinguish verbal and nominal variants.
- Pronoun clitics are annotated as inflectional morphology on verbs/complementizers.
- Relative pronouns co-occur with invariable relative markers wie/wo/was.

The guidelines aim to cover common structures in a principled way to support consistent Corpus annotation.
