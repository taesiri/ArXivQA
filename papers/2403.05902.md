# [MaiBaam Annotation Guidelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05902)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Overview
- This paper provides annotation guidelines for the MaiBaam corpus, a Bavarian German treebank annotated with Universal Dependencies. 
- It covers decisions related to preprocessing, tokenization, part-of-speech tags, dependencies, and specific phenomena in Bavarian grammar.

Preprocessing and Tokenization
- Original formatting like italics and bold are removed. Lists are skipped unless they contain full sentences. 
- Typos and punctuation errors are preserved. Sentence splitting follows general guidelines. 
- Special German multiword tokens like fused prepositions and determiners are split (zum â†’ zu + m).
- Personal names get a flat relation between determiner, family name and given name.

Part-of-Speech Tags 
- Follows general UD guidelines. modal particles are tagged as adverbs, not particles. Participles follow STTS verb vs adjective rules. 
- Anonymized names become PROPN, placeholders like "..." become SYM.

Dependencies
- Follows UD guidelines. Oblique arguments and adjuncts are obl. Auxiliary tua is added. 
- Apposition vs parataxis decisions follow rules on predicate, subject and clause structure.

Bavarian Phenomena
- Order variation with determiners and adverbs uses non-projective annotation. 
- Infinitive constructions distinguish verbal and nominal variants.
- Pronoun clitics are annotated as inflectional morphology on verbs/complementizers.
- Relative pronouns co-occur with invariable relative markers wie/wo/was.

The guidelines aim to cover common structures in a principled way to support consistent Corpus annotation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper provides annotation guidelines for the MaiBaam treebank, a corpus of Bavarian German texts annotated with Universal Dependencies (UD). The key contributions are:

1) The paper documents detailed decisions on how to handle various syntactic constructions in Bavarian when annotating them with UD, such as inflected complementizers, relative markers like "wo", noun phrase syntax, verb constructions, pronouns, etc. These decisions align with UD guidelines where possible but also elaborate on Bavarian-specific phenomena not covered in the general UD guidelines.

2) By publishing these guidelines, the authors not only provide instructions for current and future annotators of the MaiBaam treebank, but also allow others working with this data or on related dialects to better understand the annotations.

3) The guidelines highlight differences between Standard German and Bavarian syntax/morphology that are relevant for syntactic annotation. They provide examples from the MaiBaam data and link to external research on these language phenomena where applicable.

So in summary, the main contribution is a set of coherent, detailed and publicly available UD annotation guidelines tailored to the Bavarian dialect, with the goals of ensuring consistent treebank annotation and providing explanations of the MaiBaam analysis decisions to external researchers interested in their data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Bavarian (language/dialect)
- Part-of-speech tagging
- Dependency parsing
- Universal Dependencies
- Annotation guidelines
- Morphosyntax
- Clitics
- Relative clauses
- Copulas
- Infinitive constructions

The paper provides annotation guidelines for part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing of Bavarian, a family of dialects spoken in Bavaria, Germany. It elaborates on the general Universal Dependencies guidelines and German UD guidelines to account for some of the morphosyntactic peculiarities of Bavarian, such as clitic pronouns, complementizer agreement, relative clause constructions using invariant particles like "wo", and infinitive constructions with "z(u)". The guidelines cover decisions on tokenization, POS tags, dependency relations, and analyze linguistic phenomena such as pronouns, auxiliaries, noun phrases and verb phrases in Bavarian. So the key terms revolve around creating computational grammar resources for this dialect.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper provides guidelines for linguistically annotating a Bavarian corpus with part-of-speech tags and syntactic dependencies that build on the Universal Dependencies frameworks from a German language perspective, including annotation decisions addressing Bavarian-specific grammatical features such as clitic pronouns, infinitive markers, and relative clauses.
