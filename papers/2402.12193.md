# [A Chinese Dataset for Evaluating the Safeguards in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12193)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a new Chinese dataset for evaluating the safety mechanisms of large language models, consisting of over 3,000 prompts covering diverse risks, and proposes fine-grained guidelines for assessing response harmfulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. It constructs a Chinese LLM safety evaluation dataset from three attack perspectives, aimed to model risk perception and sensitivity to specific words and phrases.

2. It proposes new evaluation guidelines to assess the response harmfulness for both manual annotation and automatic evaluation, which can better identify why a given response is potentially dangerous. 

3. It evaluates five LLMs using the proposed dataset and shows that they all are insensitive to three types of attacks, and the majority of the unsafe responses are concentrated on region-specific sensitive topics, which determine the final safety rank of these LLMs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- AI safety 
- Risk taxonomy
- Prompt engineering
- Multilingual evaluation
- Chinese dataset
- Region-specific sensitivity
- Safety mechanisms
- Risk perception
- False positives/negatives
- Response harmfulness 
- Value alignment
- Safety rank

The paper introduces a new Chinese dataset for evaluating the safety of LLMs, with a focus on region-specific risks. It proposes prompt modifications to model risk perception and sensitivity, along with fine-grained guidelines for manual and automatic harmfulness evaluation. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate issues with regional sensitivity and value alignment. The key contributions are the multi-perspective Chinese dataset, response analysis, and insights into improving safety for Chinese LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using three Chinese native speakers to translate the English questions into Chinese. What measures were taken to ensure consistency and accuracy in the translations? For example, did they translate the questions independently and then compare? 

2. For the region-specific sensitive topics introduced, what sources or guidelines did the authors use to determine what constitutes politically sensitive topics, controversial historical events, regional/racial issues, etc. in the Chinese cultural context? 

3. In modifying risky questions to make them seem safer, generating the "evasive variant", how was it determined which modifications strategies (like providing specific examples or creating realistic scenarios) were most effective? Was there a validation process?

4. The paper evaluates 5 different Chinese language models. What criteria were used to select these specific models compared to other available options? Why were these models determined to be representative?  

5. The paper mentions using strategies from Liu et al. 2023 to augment the dataset by generating prompts from seed topics. Can you describe these strategies and seed topic selection process in more detail?  

6. For the automatic risk evaluation using GPT-4, what metrics were tracked to measure/validate the accuracy of GPT-4's judgments on response harmfulness? How did its performance compare to human judgment?

7. For the responding pattern analysis, what inter-annotator agreement was measured between human annotators when categorizing responses according to the 6 predefined categories? How was disagreement resolved?

8. The analysis finds the safety rank order differs compared to evaluation results on the English Do-Not-Answer dataset. What factors may contribute to this difference beyond relative language proficiency?  

9. Are there limitations or biases in the evaluation results when relying on a Western-developed model like GPT-4 for Chinese language risk assessments? How could this be overcome?

10. The paper focuses on safety evaluation for generative chatbots. Could similar methods be applicable to evaluate potential harms from large retrieval models? What modifications would be required?
