# [Res-VMamba: Fine-Grained Food Category Visual Classification Using   Selective State Space Models with Deep Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15761)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Food image recognition is challenging due to high intra-class variation and low inter-class differences, requiring fine-grained classification methods. Current CNN and ViT models have limitations in capturing subtle visual features to distinguish food categories. The paper identifies the CNFOOD-241 dataset as an underexploited resource that poses a greater challenge for state-of-the-art models compared to other food recognition benchmarks.

Proposed Solution:
The paper pioneers the application of the State Space Model called VMamba for fine-grained food classification. VMamba captures both global and local features through its unique state-based architecture. The paper proposes Res-VMamba which integrates residual learning into VMamba to further enhance feature representation by fusing raw input features with processed state features.  

Contributions:
- Provides comparative analysis positioning CNFOOD-241 as a more complex food recognition benchmark than others. New train/validation/test split introduced.
- First work successfully applying the state-of-the-art VMamba model to fine-grained food classification, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models.  
- Proposes an enhanced Res-VMamba model incorporating residual learning into VMamba, improving performance over vanilla VMamba and achieving new state-of-the-art on CNFOOD-241 dataset with 78.26% top-1 test accuracy.
- Elucidates VMamba's efficacy for food recognition while pioneering new research directions applying state space models to fine-grained classification.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions applying a cutting-edge technique to a complex food recognition dataset and advancing state-of-the-art in this domain. The proposed Res-VMamba establishes a new performance benchmark on the CNFOOD-241 dataset.
