# [Mixed-Integer Optimisation of Graph Neural Networks for Computer-Aided   Molecular Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01228)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results for modelling graph-structured data like molecules for computer aided molecular design (CAMD). 
- However, using GNNs for optimisation in CAMD poses challenges as typical optimisation methods like Bayesian optimisation and genetic algorithms cannot guarantee finding the global optimum.  
- Recent works have formulated neural networks with ReLU activations as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs), enabling optimisation to global optimality. But these works have focused only on standard multilayer perceptrons.

Proposed Solution:
- This paper proposes for the first time MILP and MINLP (mixed integer nonlinear programming) formulations for two types of trained graph neural networks - the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the GraphSAGE network.

- For GCN, an MINLP formulation is proposed by linearising the components using big-M constraints and introducing support variables and constraints to handle the nonlinear terms involving the graph structure.

- For GraphSAGE, an MILP formulation is proposed by using big-M constraints to encode conditional sums that depend on the graph structure.

Contributions:
- MINLP formulation for the GCN network, enabling optimisation of GCNs to global optimality.

- MILP formulation for the GraphSAGE network, also enabling global optimisation for GraphSAGE models.

- Demonstration of the approach on a case study for optimising boiling points of molecules by modelling them with GCN and GraphSAGE networks and then optimising the MILP/MINLP formulations. The case study found molecules with optimal predicted boiling points, some matched real experimentally observed molecules.

So in summary, the paper proposes novel optimisation formulations for GNNs to enable their use in computer aided molecular design and other optimisation applications while guaranteeing global optimal solutions. The viability is shown on a case study for optimising boiling points.
