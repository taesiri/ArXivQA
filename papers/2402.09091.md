# [Play Guessing Game with LLM: Indirect Jailbreak Attack with Implicit   Clues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09091)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes an indirect jailbreak attack approach called Puzzler that provides implicit clues about a malicious query to large language models to elicit compromised responses, while evading detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing an indirect jailbreak attack approach called Puzzler, which can bypass LLM's defensive strategies and obtain malicious responses by implicitly providing the LLM with clues about the original malicious query. Specifically:

1) It adopts a defensive stance initially to gather clues about the original malicious query from the LLM, thereby overcoming blocks to direct attacks. 

2) It automatically generates a diverse set of defensive measures against the malicious query, evaluates them to filter out irrelevant ones, and then acquires corresponding offensive measures.

3) It conducts the jailbreak attack by presenting the LLM with these offensive measures (clues of the original query) and prompting it to speculate on the true malicious intent hidden within.

4) Experimental results show Puzzler achieves 14.0%-82.7% higher query success rate than baselines in jailbreaking prominent LLMs, and evades detection by state-of-the-art jailbreak detection methods more effectively than baselines.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and evaluating an indirect jailbreak attack approach that can more effectively bypass LLM's defensive strategies by implicitly representing malicious intent.

The paper proposes an indirect jailbreak attack approach called "Puzzler" which provides implicit clues to large language models to elicit malicious responses while bypassing their safety defenses. It draws wisdom from Sun Tzu's "Art of War" by first taking a defensive stance to gather relevant clues. Key performance metrics evaluated include query success rate and following rate compared to baselines. Limitations and ethical considerations around responsible disclosure are also discussed.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the "Defensive Measures Creation" phase work to generate a diverse set of defenses against the original malicious query? What techniques are used to encourage the language model to provide detailed and varied responses? 

2) What is the rationale behind first taking a "defensive stance" when interacting with the language model? How does this allow the method to gather relevant clues without being blocked by the model?

3) What criteria and techniques are used in the "Offensive Measures Generation" phase to filter the defensive measures and transform them into offensive clues? How isrelevance to the original query ensured?  

4) Explain the design of the jailbreak prompt used in the "Indirect Jailbreak Attack" phase. What constraints are placed to encourage speculation of intent while avoiding direct statements?

5) How does providing fragmented offensive clues allow language models to guess at the underlying malicious intent without triggering safety alignment mechanisms? What theories support this?  

6) Why does directly expressing malicious intent lead to poorer performance in jailbreaking modern language models? What defenses can detect these explicit attack patterns?

7) How does the performance of the method vary across different categories of language models (closed vs open source)? What factors explain these differences?

8) How might future language models defend against the implicit jailbreak techniques proposed in this paper? What capabilities would be required?

9) What are some potential limitations or ethical concerns regarding this indirect approach for jailbreaking AI systems? How might these be addressed?  

10) Could elements of this approach be adapted to test language models in more ethical ways? What modifications would enable responsible probing of model capabilities?
