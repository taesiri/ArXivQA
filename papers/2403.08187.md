# [Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for the Diagnosis of pronunciation of   Speech Sound Disorders in Korean children](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Children with speech sound disorders (SSDs) are currently diagnosed by speech-language pathologists manually transcribing the child's speech and analyzing errors. This is time-consuming and labor-intensive.  
- Traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are designed to recognize speech as real words, so cannot handle the mispronunciations of children with SSDs.
- There is limited prior work on ASR for detecting mispronunciations in non-English child speech and speech disorders.

Proposed Solution:
- Fine-tune the wav2vec2.0 XLS-R pre-trained speech model on a small labeled dataset of Korean child SSD speech (137 children, 73 words, 1.5 hours of speech).
- Model is trained to recognize speech as pronounced rather than with correct spelling. 
- Compare with baseline Whisper model and effects of language model weighting.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated an e2e ASR model can learn acoustic features of Korean child SSD speech using just 1.5 hours of labeled data with ~90% accuracy.  
- First study building an ASR model for detecting native language (Korean) pronunciation disorders.
- Compares state-of-the-art models (Wav2vec2.0 and Whisper) for child SSD speech recognition.
- Finds language model weighting does not improve performance for this specialized word recognition task.
- Analyzed error patterns of model, consonants with similar pronunciations had higher error rates.
- Overall shows feasibility of using ASR to automate diagnosis of speech sound disorders.
