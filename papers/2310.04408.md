# [RECOMP: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LMs with Compression and Selective   Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04408)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we improve retrieval-augmented language models by compressing retrieved documents into concise summaries before using them for augmentation?

The key points are:

- Retrieval-augmented LMs prepend retrieved documents to the input, but this can be inefficient and confuse the model. 

- The paper proposes compressing retrieved documents into textual summaries before prepending them. This makes augmentation more efficient and helps the model focus on relevant information.

- Two compression methods are presented: extractive (selecting sentences) and abstractive (generating summaries). Both are trained to improve the LM's performance when prepending the summary.

- The compressors can selectively output no summary when retrieved docs are unhelpful, enabling selective augmentation.

- Experiments show the approach improves efficiency and performance on LM and QA, significantly outperforming baseline summarization methods. Analysis examines faithfulness, transferability, and other properties.

So in summary, the key research question is how to improve retrieval-augmented LMs using document compression and selective augmentation, which is addressed through the proposed training schemes and compressor architectures. The paper aims to show this approach can make augmentation more efficient and effective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing RECOMP, an intermediate step for retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) which compresses retrieved documents into textual summaries before using them for in-context augmentation. 

2. Presenting two compression models: an extractive compressor which selects useful sentences, and an abstractive compressor which generates summaries synthesizing information from documents.

3. Designing training schemes to optimize the compressors for improving the performance of blackbox LMs on end tasks when the compressed summary is prepended. This allows selective augmentation by generating empty summaries when retrieved docs are unhelpful.

4. Evaluating the approach on language modeling and open-domain QA tasks. Showing the compressors can significantly reduce tokens needed for augmentation (e.g. 25% of tokens on Wikitext) with minimal performance loss.

5. Demonstrating the compressors trained for one LM can transfer to other LMs for the language modeling task. And providing analysis suggesting the summaries are largely faithful to original documents.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating an intermediate compression step to improve efficiency and effectiveness of retrieval augmented LMs, while still allowing blackbox application. The trained compressors reduce computational costs and guide LMs to leverage relevant information from retrieved documents.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents a novel method called RECOMP for compressing retrieved documents before using them to augment language models. Other related works like REPLUG and RAKI focus more on reranking or adapting the retriever, while this paper introduces an intermediate compression step.

- For training the compressors, the paper leverages end task performance signals from the target language model. This differs from prior work on distillation for summarization that uses intrinsic metrics like ROUGE. Optimizing for the end task is a key contribution.

- The paper demonstrates strong results on language modeling and open-domain QA. The trained compressors significantly outperform heuristic baselines and off-the-shelf summarizers. The transferability of the trained compressors to different LMs is also analyzed.

- The paper provides useful analysis and ablations like comparing extractive vs. abstractive compressors, evaluating faithfulness, and analyzing model behavior. This sheds light on when compression helps or hurts.

- Overall, the RECOMP framework and training schemes are novel. The paper makes excellent progress towards efficient and selective in-context augmentation of LMs. The analysis also surfaces limitations and areas for future work like multi-hop QA.

In summary, the key novelties are the RECOMP framework itself, the end-task oriented training schemes, strong results beating baselines, and thoughtful analysis. The paper advances efficient RALM research in new directions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing adaptive extractive compression methods, where the number of sentences prepended can vary for different input examples. This could allow for more flexible selective augmentation.

- Further exploration of learning abstractive compressors for more complex tasks like HotpotQA, where the authors found extractive compression to be more effective. Abstractive compression for multi-hop QA remains an open challenge.

- Experimenting with different prompts and prompt engineering strategies for the abstractive compressor, especially for language modeling where it was difficult to find an effective single prompt.

- Analyzing the faithfulness of generated summaries more thoroughly, especially for abstractive compression. The authors only conducted a small manual evaluation.

- Testing transferability of the trained compressors to other languages beyond English.

- Evaluating how conditioning the compressors on different base LMs impacts the transferability of the generated summaries.

- Exploring other training objectives beyond the end-task oriented schemes, like incorporating intrinsic summarization metrics.

- Applying retrieval compression to a broader set of NLP tasks beyond language modeling and QA.

- Comparing compression to other selective augmentation methods like adaptive retrieval.

In summary, the authors propose further work on adaptivity, faithfulness, transferability, training objectives, and application to other tasks/languages for their retrieval compression approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called RECOMP to improve retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). RALMs work by retrieving relevant documents and prepending them to the input context. However, prepending long documents makes inference more expensive and can confuse the model with irrelevant information. RECOMP addresses this by compressing the retrieved documents into short textual summaries before prepending them. The summaries are generated by either an extractive model which selects sentences from the documents or an abstractive model which synthesizes information. Both compressors are trained to improve the language model's performance on a downstream task when their summary is prepended, while keeping the summary concise. At times, the compressor can output an empty string when retrieval does not help, enabling selective augmentation. Experiments on language modeling and question answering show RECOMP can achieve high compression rates (as low as 6%) with minimal performance drops, outperforming standard summarization models. The generated summaries also transfer across language models and are largely faithful to the original documents. Overall, RECOMP improves the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieval augmentation for blackbox language models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called RECOMP to improve retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). RALMs work by retrieving relevant documents and prepending them to the input context. However, prepending long documents increases computational costs and can confuse the model with irrelevant information. 

RECOMP introduces an intermediate step to compress the retrieved documents into a short textual summary before prepending to the input. There are two versions proposed: an extractive compressor which selects relevant sentences, and an abstractive compressor which synthesizes information into a new summary. Both aim to produce a concise yet informative summary to guide the language model to generate the correct output. The compressors are trained using end task objectives to optimize for performance gains in the language model. Experiments on language modeling and question answering tasks demonstrate that RECOMP enables substantial compression of retrieved documents (as low as 5-10% of original tokens) while maintaining high accuracy, outperforming standard summarization models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a method called RECOMP (Retrieve, Compress, Prepend) to improve retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs). RECOMP introduces an intermediate step that compresses the retrieved documents into a short textual summary before prepending them to the input of the language model. Two compression models are presented: an extractive model that selects the most relevant sentences from the retrieved documents, and an abstractive model that synthesizes information from the documents into a new summary. The compressors are trained to produce useful summaries that improve the language model's performance on a downstream task when prepended to the input. To satisfy conciseness and selectivity, the compressors can output empty summaries when retrieved documents are irrelevant. The extractive model is trained with contrastive learning to identify helpful sentences, while the abstractive model is trained by distilling an extreme-scale LM's summarization abilities. Experiments on language modeling and QA tasks show the compressors enable significant compression ratios and performance gains over baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is how to improve retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) by compressing retrieved documents before integrating them into the model input context. 

Some key problems/limitations with directly prepending retrieved documents that the paper discusses are:

- Increases computational costs as the model now has to encode substantially more tokens

- Even models adapted to long contexts struggle to fully utilize all the information, often missing important details not at the start

- Prepending many documents can confuse the model with irrelevant information, hurting performance 

To address these issues, the paper proposes an intermediate compression step (called RECOMP) which summarizes the retrieved documents into a shorter text before prepending to the input context. The benefits highlighted are:

- Reduces number of input tokens, lowering computational costs

- Helps the model focus on key relevant information from the documents

- Allows selective augmentation, generating empty summaries when retrieved docs are not useful

The paper explores two compression methods - extractive (selecting sentences) and abstractive (generating new summary text). The compressors are trained to optimize end task performance when prepending the summary, while minimizing length.

So in summary, the main problem is improving RALMs by dealing with long retrieved contexts, and the proposal is intermediate document compression and selective augmentation.
