# [Explainable Multi-hop Question Generation: An End-to-End Approach   without Intermediate Question Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- With the increasing use of interactive AI, the demand for handling complex questions that require multi-step reasoning over several documents has grown. 
- Previous multi-hop question generation (QG) models using end-to-end approaches face limitations in generating logically coherent complex questions as the number of referenced documents increases.
- An existing question rewriting framework requires labeled intermediate questions to train the model, which is laborious.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an End-to-End Question Rewriting (E2EQR) model that performs step-by-step question rewriting to increase question complexity without needing intermediate question labels.
- It uses a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. In each step, it takes a document and rewrites the question from the previous step to make it more complex by incorporating information from the new document.
- It uses an accumulated self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to implicitly transfer information between steps rather than explicitly taking the intermediate questions as input. This allows end-to-end training. 
- It also uses an adaptive curriculum learning strategy to prevent catastrophic forgetting and overfitting.

Main Contributions:
- The proposed E2EQR model achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models in multi-hop QG while also generating intermediate questions.
- It generates logically coherent complex questions, especially 3-4 hop questions, that accurately correspond to the input answers.
- It enables end-to-end training without requiring intermediate question labels which previous question rewriting frameworks needed.
- The generated QA pairs are shown to be beneficial for training QA models compared to an end-to-end baseline model.
- Analysis shows the model successfully rewrites intermediate questions to logically increase complexity and relevance based on input documents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces an end-to-end multi-hop question generation model that incrementally rewrites intermediate questions to increase complexity without needing ground truth labels for the intermediate questions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The authors introduce an explainable multi-hop question generation model that performs step-by-step question rewriting to increase the question complexity. 

2) Their model is trained end-to-end without the need to label intermediate questions.

3) Their question rewriting approach demonstrates effectiveness in logically generating complex questions, particularly 3- and 4-hop questions, that correspond appropriately to the input answers.  

4) The synthetic multi-hop QA data generated by their model proves to be beneficial for training QA models.

In summary, the key contribution is an end-to-end question rewriting model for multi-hop question generation that can logically increase question complexity without relying on intermediate question labels. The model is shown to generate high-quality complex question-answer pairs that are useful for training QA systems.

The paper introduces an end-to-end question rewriting model for multi-hop question generation that incrementally increases question complexity through sequential rewriting steps. Key aspects include end-to-end training without labeled intermediate questions, a curriculum learning strategy, and accumulated self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to enable implicit question rewriting. The model is evaluated on multi-hop QA datasets and shows strong performance in generating logically coherent complex questions, especially 3-4 hop questions, that match input answers. Benefits for data augmentation and training QA models are also demonstrated. So the key focus areas cover end-to-end multi-hop question generation, question rewriting, intermediate question generation, and complex reasoning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an end-to-end question rewriting (E2EQR) model. Can you explain in detail how this model works and how it incrementally increases question complexity?

2. Document arrangement and bridge entity extraction are important preprocessing steps. Can you describe the process of constructing the document graph and using it to extract bridge entities and arrange documents? 

3. The accumulated self-attention (SA) and accumulated cross-attention (CA) mechanisms are key components of the E2EQR model. How do these accumulated attention mechanisms allow implicit question rewriting without intermediate question labels?

4. Adaptive curriculum learning is utilized during training. Explain the main hyperparameters used in this algorithm and how they enable robust performance across varying question complexities.  

5. Quantitative analysis shows the E2EQR model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. Can you analyze these results in more depth and discuss the tradeoffs?

6. Human evaluation reveals advantages of E2EQR in answer matching for 3- and 4-hop questions. What factors lead to this performance difference compared to baseline models?

7. Experiments show the synthetic QA pairs generated by E2EQR improve QA model performance. Analyze why the precision of E2EQR in creating multi-hop QA pairs provides this benefit.  

8. Provide a detailed analysis of the ablation studies on accumulated SA and CA mechanisms. How do the results demonstrate E2EQR relies on prior step information?

9. Four training strategies are experimented with. Compare and contrast their tradeoffs and analyze why adaptive curriculum learning performs the best.

10. Case studies reveal differences between E2EQR and baseline methods. Can you analyze example generations and discuss why E2EQR produces more logical multi-hop questions?
