# [Delivering Arbitrary-Modal Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01480)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve robust and accurate semantic segmentation with multiple modalities in adverse weather conditions and partial sensor failure scenarios. 

Specifically, the paper focuses on two key problems:

1. How to fuse an arbitrary number of modalities to maximize segmentation accuracy. The paper hypothesizes that using more modalities will monotonically increase accuracy due to more diverse complementary information.

2. How to make semantic segmentation robust to individual sensor failures by fusing multiple modalities. The paper hypothesizes that cooperation of multiple sensors can effectively resolve partial sensor outages.

To investigate these problems, the paper presents:

- The DeLiVER benchmark with 4 modalities (RGB, depth, event, LiDAR), 4 adverse weather conditions (cloudy, foggy, night, rainy), and 5 sensor failure modes.

- The CMNeXt segmentation model with a Hub2Fuse paradigm using asymmetric branches and two key components:
   - Self-Query Hub (SQ-Hub) to select informative features from modalities
   - Parallel Pooling Mixer (PPX) to efficiently fuse modalities

Through experiments on 6 datasets with up to 81 modalities, the paper shows CMNeXt achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can overcome individual sensor failures via multimodal fusion. The results support the hypotheses that using more modalities improves accuracy, and fusing multiple modalities increases robustness.

In summary, the central research question is how to achieve robust and accurate semantic segmentation by fusing an arbitrary number of modalities, even in the presence of sensor failures. The proposed DeLiVER benchmark and CMNeXt model aim to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper appear to be:

- The creation of a new multimodal dataset called DeLiVER for arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation. The dataset contains depth, LiDAR, event camera, and RGB data and includes different weather conditions and sensor failure modes. 

- The proposal of a new fusion model called CMNeXt for arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation. The model uses an asymmetric architecture with two branches - one for RGB and one for other modalities. It incorporates a Self-Query Hub to select informative features from auxiliary modalities and a Parallel Pooling Mixer to efficiently fuse features.

- Extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance of CMNeXt on the new DeLiVER dataset as well as other datasets when fusing up to 81 modalities. The model is shown to be robust to different weather conditions and sensor failures.

In summary, the main contributions are a new multimodal dataset, a new fusion model for arbitrary-modal segmentation, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the model on multiple datasets with varying numbers of modalities. The key ideas are using an asymmetric architecture to fuse features from arbitrary modalities and mechanisms to select informative features and fuse them efficiently.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new multimodal dataset DeLiVER with depth, LiDAR, events, and RGB modalities in various weather conditions and sensor failure scenarios, and presents a universal arbitrary cross-modal segmentation model CMNeXt with a Self-Query Hub and Parallel Pooling Mixer to effectively fuse features from any number of modalities for robust segmentation.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new multimodal semantic segmentation dataset and model for fusing arbitrary numbers of modalities. Here are my thoughts on how it compares to related work:

- The DeLiVER dataset provides 4 modalities (RGB, depth, event, LiDAR) with diverse weather conditions and sensor failures, advancing previous multimodal datasets (e.g. MFNet, KITTI-360) by providing more modalities and challenging conditions. It enables studying robustness to sensor failures.

- The CMNeXt model builds on recent work on multimodal fusion like CMX and HRFuser, but presents a new asymmetric "Hub2Fuse" design to handle an arbitrary number of modalities without substantially increasing computation. This advances the capability for scaling to many modalities. 

- The Self-Query Hub and Parallel Pooling Mixer are new designs for effectively extracting and fusing complementary multimodal features, outperforming other fusion blocks like those in CMX and TokenFusion.

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance by CMNeXt on the new DeLiVER benchmark as well as existing datasets, validating its effectiveness and scalability for fusing up to 81 modalities. This significantly advances the capability for arbitrary multimodal fusion.

- The study of different fusion paradigms (separate, joint, asymmetric branches) provides useful analysis and motivation for the Hub2Fuse design. The comparisons to alternative fusion blocks are also informative.

Overall, I think this work provides significant advances in arbitrary multimodal fusion for segmentation by introducing a new challenging benchmark dataset, an asymmetric model design to scale modalities, and outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. The designs and analysis around effectively fusing many modalities are the key contributions.
