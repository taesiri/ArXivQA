# [Mathematical Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09413)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Standard definitions of explanation (e.g. Halpern & Pearl) rely on causality and an agent's epistemic state. But mathematical facts hold in all possible worlds, so agents know them with probability 1.
- This means mathematical facts cannot be part of a causal explanation under existing definitions, since explanations must consist of things not already known by the agent.
- So there is a problem in defining mathematical explanations using causal models, since the facts of mathematics cannot be causes in a causal model if they are already known.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use "impossible possible worlds" where mathematical facts can be violated, even though an agent knows they hold in the real world.
- By allowing models where mathematical facts like "4373 is prime" can be false, these facts can now be uncertain to the agent and hence part of a causal explanation.

- Concretely, consider an explanatory model with variables for "4373 is prime (P_4373)", "4373 is 1 mod 4 (M4_4373)", and "4373 is sum of squares (S2S_4373)". Allow models where P_4373 and S2S_4373 can be false.
- Now P_4373=1 and M4_4373=1 together can causally explain S2S_4373=1 by the HP definition, even though the agent knows these mathematical facts must be true.

- A similar approach works for explaining why a polynomial equals 0 when plugging in some number - allow models where the mathematically necessary relationships between factors and roots can be violated.

Main Contributions:
- A way to apply causal definitions of explanation to mathematical domains by using "impossible" models that violate mathematical truths.
- Shows how mathematical explanations can be causal, uncertain to agents, and compete as better or worse explanations based on causality and prior probability.
- Extends the HP definition of explanation to cover mathematical explanations.
