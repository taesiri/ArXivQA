# [Open-Set Representation Learning through Combinatorial Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15278)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new representation learning approach for identifying and learning novel visual concepts, when only some training examples are labeled and unlabeled data contains both known and novel classes. 

- The main hypothesis is that novel classes can be discovered and represented by combining multiple coarse-grained classifiers trained on heterogeneous partitions of the known classes (called meta-classes). The composition of outputs from these meta-classifiers can identify regions corresponding to potential novel classes.

- The paper also hypothesizes that learning pairwise relations between examples in an unsupervised manner, via contrastive loss and consistency regularization, can further improve the quality of embeddings for both known and novel classes.

- The overall goal is to learn a unified model that represents both known and novel classes effectively, without needing any prior information about the novel classes like their number.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a combinatorial classification approach along with unsupervised pairwise relation learning can enable identifying and representing novel visual concepts from mixed labeled and unlabeled data. The key research question is how to effectively learn representations for novel classes in this challenging setup.
