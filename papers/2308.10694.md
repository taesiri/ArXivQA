# [Vanishing Point Estimation in Uncalibrated Images with Prior Gravity   Direction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10694)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is how to estimate the 3D rotation and focal length of a camera from a single image, assuming a Manhattan world structure, when the vertical direction (gravity vector) is known but the focal length is unknown. The key contributions appear to be:- Providing an analysis of minimal line configurations needed to solve this problem.- Proposing two new minimal solvers that use only 2 lines (compared to previous methods that required 3-4 lines without gravity information). One of these solvers overcomes a singularity issue in prior work.- Developing a non-minimal solver to refine the solution using many lines, which significantly boosts accuracy. - Combining all solvers into a robust RANSAC framework that adaptively chooses the best approach based on the quality of the vertical direction prior.The central hypothesis seems to be that leveraging prior knowledge of the vertical direction will allow more accurate and efficient recovery of the focal length and rotation compared to not using this information. The paper aims to demonstrate this through both theoretical analysis of minimal solvers, and experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets.In summary, the key research contributions are in exploring minimal solver configurations for this problem, overcoming limitations of prior work, and effectively combining solvers in a hybrid framework to maximize accuracy and robustness. The experiments aim to validate that these new techniques outperform previous uncalibrated methods, especially when an approximate vertical direction is known.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems the main contributions of this paper are:1. Providing an exhaustive analysis of minimal line configurations for estimating vanishing points and focal length with a known vertical direction (e.g. from an IMU).2. Deriving two new 2-line solvers for configurations not previously discussed, one of which avoids singularities in existing solvers.3. Proposing a new non-minimal solver to refine the estimate using an arbitrary number of lines. 4. Combining all solvers into a robust hybrid RANSAC framework that adaptively chooses the best solver based on the accuracy of the vertical direction prior.5. Demonstrating through experiments on synthetic and real datasets that their method achieves higher accuracy than previous state-of-the-art, especially when only a rough gravity prior is available.6. Showing the applicability of their solvers for relative camera rotation estimation on a real-world dataset.In summary, the key innovation seems to be the exhaustive analysis of minimal solver configurations, the proposal of new stable 2-line solvers, and their combination in a robust estimation framework that can leverage even rough prior knowledge about the vertical direction. This results in improved accuracy for vanishing point and focal length estimation.
