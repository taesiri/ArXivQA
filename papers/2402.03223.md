# [English Prompts are Better for NLI-based Zero-Shot Emotion   Classification than Target-Language Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03223)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emotion classification is an important NLP task but lacks resources in many languages beyond English. 
- Prompt-based learning allows applying pre-trained multilingual models in a zero-shot setting without fine-tuning.
- It is unclear whether prompts should be translated to the target language or kept in English when classifying emotions in non-English text.  

Methods:
- Evaluate prompt performance for emotion classification on 3 datasets covering 18 languages.
- Use 6 multilingual NLI models as base models, including XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, Ernie. 
- Test 7 prompt templates from previous work, translating them to target languages.
- Analyze the interaction of prompt language, prompt type, model and data language.

Key Findings:
- English prompts consistently outperform translated target language prompts, even on distant languages.
- The relative performance of different prompt types is consistent across languages and models. 
- Some evidence that target language prompts can sometimes better capture language-specific emotion connotations.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of multilingual prompting for emotion classification.
- Demonstrates English prompts transfer robustly as a simple but effective strategy. 
- Provides guidance to practitioners on prompt engineering for multilingual models.
- Opens up further research on understanding language-specific biases and differences.

Overall, the paper clearly establishes the effectiveness of English prompts for multilingual zero-shot emotion classification, while highlighting areas for future work to better adapt prompts to specific languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the effects of prompt language, prompt type, and model choice on zero-shot cross-lingual emotion classification, finding that English prompts consistently outperform translated prompts across languages, models, and prompt formulations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper studies the optimal way to transfer English emotion classification prompts to other languages when using multilingual language models. Specifically, it compares using the English prompts directly versus translating the prompts to match the data language. The key findings are:

1) English prompts consistently outperform translated prompts across 18 languages, 6 NLI models, and 7 prompt types. This suggests English prompts transfer better cross-lingually. 

2) The relative performance of different prompt types is largely consistent across languages. So a good English prompt tends to also work well when directly transferred.

3) The superiority of English prompts holds across most NLI models, with one exception that requires more study.

In summary, the paper shows English prompts transfer surprisingly well for multilingual emotion classification without adaptation, and documents some consistent patterns around cross-lingual prompt transfer.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Emotion classification
- Multilingual emotion classification 
- Zero-shot classification
- Prompt-based learning
- Natural language inference (NLI)
- Prompt engineering
- Prompt translation
- Cross-lingual transfer
- Multilingual language models

The paper explores prompt-based zero-shot emotion classification in multiple languages using natural language inference and multilingual language models. It specifically looks at whether English prompts work better than translated target language prompts for classifying emotions in non-English texts. The key research questions focus on prompt language translation, performance of different prompt types across languages, and consistency across different multilingual NLI models.

So in summary, the key terms cover: emotion classification, multilinguality, zero-shot learning, prompting, NLI, prompt engineering, cross-lingual transfer, and multilingual language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper compares using English prompts versus translated prompts for emotion classification. What are some potential reasons why English prompts performed better overall? Could this indicate biases in the training of the multilingual models?

2. The paper finds that certain prompt types like "emo-name" and "emo-s" consistently perform well across languages. What properties of these prompt types might explain their strong performance? 

3. The authors use Google Translate to create the translated prompts. What issues could arise from using machine translation instead of human translations? How might this impact the performance of the translated prompts?

4. For future work, the authors suggest better understanding the interaction between the language model's training data, the prompt type, and performance across languages. What specifically should be explored regarding this interaction? What experiments could shed light on this?

5. The "mdebertatasksource" model behaves differently from the other models in terms of prompt type performance. Why might fine-tuning on a different NLI dataset like Tasksource change the model's preferences for certain prompt types?

6. The analysis shows some examples where the target language prompt makes more reasonable predictions than the English prompt. What commonalities might these examples share that could help improve prompt development in other languages?

7. The authors suggest adapting the language model differently for each target language to enable better performance from non-English prompts. How specifically could this cross-lingual model alignment be done considering different prompts? 

8. The paper focuses on single-label emotion classification. How might the relative performance of English versus translated prompts change in a multi-label setting? Why?

9. The authors use several emotion classification datasets spanning 18 languages. Would you expect their conclusions to generalize to other languages not included in the study datasets? Why or why not?

10. The authors control variables like model, dataset language, prompt language, and prompt type in their experiments. Are there any other variables that would be informative to consider in future work in this area? What might these reveal?
