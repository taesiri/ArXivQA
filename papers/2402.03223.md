# [English Prompts are Better for NLI-based Zero-Shot Emotion   Classification than Target-Language Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03223)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Emotion classification is an important NLP task but lacks resources in many languages beyond English. 
- Prompt-based learning allows applying pre-trained multilingual models in a zero-shot setting without fine-tuning.
- It is unclear whether prompts should be translated to the target language or kept in English when classifying emotions in non-English text.  

Methods:
- Evaluate prompt performance for emotion classification on 3 datasets covering 18 languages.
- Use 6 multilingual NLI models as base models, including XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, Ernie. 
- Test 7 prompt templates from previous work, translating them to target languages.
- Analyze the interaction of prompt language, prompt type, model and data language.

Key Findings:
- English prompts consistently outperform translated target language prompts, even on distant languages.
- The relative performance of different prompt types is consistent across languages and models. 
- Some evidence that target language prompts can sometimes better capture language-specific emotion connotations.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of multilingual prompting for emotion classification.
- Demonstrates English prompts transfer robustly as a simple but effective strategy. 
- Provides guidance to practitioners on prompt engineering for multilingual models.
- Opens up further research on understanding language-specific biases and differences.

Overall, the paper clearly establishes the effectiveness of English prompts for multilingual zero-shot emotion classification, while highlighting areas for future work to better adapt prompts to specific languages.
