# [Moirai: Towards Optimal Placement for Distributed Inference on   Heterogeneous Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04025)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents Moirai, a new algorithmic approach for optimal device placement of deep neural networks (DNNs) across heterogeneous devices to minimize end-to-end inference latency. Moirai incorporates two key innovations: (1) a graph coarsening method using operator fusion from inference backends to reduce the search space while maintaining runtime optimizations, and (2) a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that accounts for device heterogeneity in computation, memory, and communication. Experiments using Vision, NLP, and biological models across 2 device clusters show Moirai outperforms state-of-the-art Placeto (up to 4.28x faster), m-SCT, and GETF, in terms of inference latency reduction and placement generation time. A key advantage is Moirai can incorporate device constraints and new objectives flexibly through the MILP formulation. Limitations are the need for profiling and longer offline placement generation time compared to simple heuristics like m-SCT, but overall Moirai advances optimal heterogeneous placement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents Moirai, an algorithmic solution for optimal device placement of deep neural networks across heterogeneous devices that incorporates graph optimization and constraints to minimize end-to-end inference latency.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an algorithmic solution named \textsc{Moirai} for the device placement problem in distributed deep learning inference. \textsc{Moirai} incorporates graph optimization, device heterogeneity, and inter-operator model parallel inference constraints.

2. It uses a graph coarsening method that considers runtime operator fusion to reduce the solution search space while maintaining optimality. This method merges operators in the computation graph that will be fused by the backend optimizer, thereby reducing the number of operators to be placed while preserving backend optimizations.

3. It formulates the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that can accommodate various constraints like memory limits, non-overlapping execution, communication overhead, and congestion control. The MILP model can also be extended to multiple heterogeneous devices.  

4. Extensive experiments show that \textsc{Moirai} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reducing end-to-end inference latency, while ensuring reasonable placement generation time. For example, it reduces inference latency by up to 4.28x compared to prior works.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposed algorithm \textsc{Moirai} that uses a combination of graph optimization and MILP modeling to effectively generate device placement solutions for distributed DNN inference across heterogeneous devices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Device placement - The problem of mapping DNN operators to computing devices to minimize end-to-end latency.

- Model parallelism - Splitting a DNN model across multiple devices to accommodate large models. Specifically, inter-operator model parallelism where the model is split between operators.

- Heterogeneous devices - Considering devices with differing computation power, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth.

- Graph coarsening - Reducing the search space for device placement by fusing operators in the DNN computation graph.

- Operator fusion - Merging multiple operators in a DNN graph into a single fused operator to avoid storing intermediate results.

- Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) - Using an MILP model to formulate the device placement optimization problem while considering various constraints.

- End-to-end latency - The inference time from model input to output, used as the optimization objective.

- Communication overhead - The time required to transfer intermediate data between operators placed on separate devices.

So in summary, the key focus is optimal device placement for distributed DNN inference across heterogeneous devices, using graph coarsening and a MILP model to maximize parallelism and minimize end-to-end latency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions incorporating runtime graph optimization to reduce the search space while maintaining inter-operator optimization provided by inference backends. Can you elaborate more on what specific graph optimizations are used and how they maintain the optimizations done by inference backends?

2. The paper uses operator fusion rules from inference backends like Eigen and NNPack to guide the grouping of operators. Can you explain the rationale behind using these specific fusion rules instead of designing custom fusion rules? 

3. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model in the paper considers device heterogeneity in terms of computation, memory and communication. Can you explain in more detail how each of these constraints is modeled mathematically in the MILP formulation?

4. The paper mentions using indicator variables like $x_{ik}$, $z_q$ and $u_{qk'k''}$ in the MILP formulation. What is the intuition behind using these binary indicator variables and how do they help capture the constraints effectively?

5. One of the constraints mentioned is congestion control when multiple outputs contend for the same communication channel. Can you explain this constraint in detail and how it avoids contention between communication operations?

6. The paper compares against learning-based and algorithmic baselines. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of using learning-based methods versus algorithmic methods for device placement? 

7. How does the graph coarsening method proposed compare qualitatively against other coarsening methods in prior works? What are the pros and cons compared to them?

8. The results show better acceleration for larger models. What is the intuition behind why larger models provide greater parallelism and better resource utilization?

9. The paper focuses on inter-operator model parallelism. How do you think the method can be extended for other parallelism strategies like data parallelism or pipeline parallelism? 

10. The method uses the Gurobi optimizer to solve the MILP problem. What are some other optimization solvers that can be tried instead and what would be their trade-offs?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming larger in size to achieve better accuracy. This requires large memory and compute resources beyond the capability of a single device. 
- Distributing DNN models across multiple heterogeneous devices (model parallelism) is a solution, but finding the optimal mapping of operators to devices (device placement) is challenging due to the exponential search space and device heterogeneity.

Proposed Solution - Moirai:
- Uses operator fusion to reduce the search space by merging multiple operators into fused operators based on backend compiler optimization rules. This maintains computational optimizations while reducing graph size.

- Formulates the device placement problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that incorporates:
   - Operator dependencies
   - Device heterogeneity in compute, memory and communication
   - Non-overlapping execution constraints 
   - Communication and congestion constraints

- Solves the MILP using Gurobi optimizer to find optimal mapping of operators to heterogeneous devices.

Main Contributions:
- Incorporates compiler-based operator fusion to reduce search space while maintaining computational optimizations missed by prior works

- General MILP formulation that considers device heterogeneity and various real-world constraints for distributed inference

- Outperforms prior state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based methods on large vision, language and biology models, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 4.28x

- Maintains reasonable placement generation time compared to learning methods that take hours, making the approach practical

The paper provides an effective algorithmic solution for distributed DNN inference across heterogeneous devices, advancing research in this area. The fusion-aware modeling and formulation of constraints makes it applicable to real systems.
