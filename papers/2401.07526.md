# [Editing Arbitrary Propositions in LLMs without Subject Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07526)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for editing factual knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) have two key limitations: 1) they only work for binary propositions representing straightforward relations between a subject and an object, and 2) they rely on having clear subject labels, which may not exist. 

- The goal is to develop a locate-and-edit (L&E) method that can edit arbitrary propositions in an LLM, without needing subject labels.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new localization method called Gradient Tracing (GT) which attributes factual knowledge to parts of the network with large gradient norms. GT is very simple/fast as it only requires one backpropagation iteration. 

- Use GT to choose an editing location, then edit using a variant of Rank-One Model Editing (ROME) called ROME^G.

- Transform the LLM into a boolean classifier on propositions using prompting, then edit to flip its classification on target propositions from true to false or vice versa.

Contributions:
- Show ROME^G performs close to ROME^S (which uses subject labels) on datasets of binary propositions, without needing labels.

- Introduce a new non-binary proposition dataset called FACT since no suitable public dataset existed. Show ROME^G can edit on FACT where other L&E methods cannot.

- Demonstrate the first L&E method capable of handling unlabeled arbitrary propositions by locating and editing knowledge in an LLM without relying on subject labels or binary relations.

In summary, the key innovation is introducing GT localization to enable extending L&E editing capabilities to broader types of factual knowledge in LLMs, without needing subject labels.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a simple and fast method called Gradient Tracing to locate factual knowledge in language models, which enables editing arbitrary propositions without needing subject labels by using a variant of Rank-One Model Editing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simple and fast method called Gradient Tracing (GT) to locate factual knowledge in language models without needing subject labels. GT allows editing arbitrary propositions, including non-binary ones, using a variant of ROME. The authors also create a new dataset called Factual Accuracy Classification Test (FACT) containing non-binary propositions to demonstrate their method, since existing datasets only contain binary propositions. Key results are:

- GT locates subject tokens in 91-92% of cases on datasets with labeled subjects, despite not using the labels. 

- The variant of ROME based on GT ($ROME^G$) performs similarly to ROME using subject labels ($ROME^S$) on binary proposition datasets, without needing the labels.

- $ROME^G$ can edit non-binary propositions on the new FACT dataset, while other methods require binary propositions and subject labels. 

So in summary, the main contribution is developing and demonstrating a localization method to enable editing of arbitrary propositions without needing subject labels.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Locate-and-Edit (L&E) methods
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Gradient Tracing (GT)
- Rank-One Model Editing (ROME)
- Editing arbitrary propositions
- Editing without subject labels
- Boolean classification 
- Factual knowledge in LLMs
- CounterFactFalse (CFF) dataset 
- CounterFactTrue (CFT) dataset
- Factual Accuracy Classification Test (FACT) dataset

The paper introduces a new localization method called Gradient Tracing that allows editing factual knowledge in LLMs without needing subject labels. This enables editing of arbitrary propositions, not just binary ones. The method is evaluated on boolean classification tasks using the CFF, CFT and new FACT datasets. It allows editing without subject labels and performs closely to state-of-the-art methods that use labels on CFF and CFT. The FACT dataset with non-binary propositions is introduced to demonstrate editing capabilities beyond existing methods.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new method called Gradient Tracing (GT) for localizing factual knowledge in language models. How does GT work and what are its key advantages over existing methods like causal tracing?

2. The paper applies GT with a variant of ROME for editing. In what ways does this variant differ from standard ROME as proposed in previous work? What is the motivation behind these differences?

3. The paper shows that GT is able to identify subject tokens most of the time despite its simplicity. What experiments or analyses were done to demonstrate this capability of GT? How does it compare to causal tracing in this regard?

4. For the CounterFact datasets, what is the breakdown of editing performance when GT localizes a subject token versus a non-subject token? What does this suggest about the importance of localization accuracy?

5. The paper introduces a new dataset called FACT. In what ways does FACT differ from existing datasets like CounterFact? Why was a new dataset necessary to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method?

6. What adjustments or optimizations needed to be made to apply the editing method on the Vicuna model? What limitations did you face in applying the approach to other models? 

7. The prompting technique used to transform Vicuna into a boolean classifier is said to be highly specific to each model. What aspects of this prompting need to be customized? Is there a way to make prompting more generalizable?

8. For the FACT dataset, what is the evidence that the statements are factually accurate? Could factual inaccuracies impact the integrity of the experimental results?

9. The method is currently restricted to boolean classification tasks. Do you foresee this as a fundamental limitation? Or can the ideas be extended to other kinds of factual knowledge editing?

10. The paper compares editing performance to a variant of ROME that uses subject labels. Should availability of subject labels be considered a strict prerequisite for knowledge editing? Or does this work demonstrate editing may be possible even without clear subject labels?
