# [APISR: Anime Production Inspired Real-World Anime Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01598)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Real-world anime super-resolution (SR) aims to restore and enhance low-quality anime images/videos. Existing methods adopt techniques from photorealistic SR which lack understanding of the anime domain.  
- The paper identifies two anime-specific challenges: 1) distorted and faint hand-drawn lines which are critical for anime visual quality, 2) unwanted color artifacts introduced by GAN training due to domain inconsistency of perceptual loss.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes Anime Production-oriented Image (API) SR dataset with a novel curation pipeline to select least compressed and most informative frames from videos. Argues image-based method is sufficient for anime SR.
- Proposes prediction-oriented compression module in degradation model to restore compression artifacts and simulate video compression degradations. Also proposes shuffled resize module for robustness.
- Enhances hand-drawn lines in GT images and merges them back as pseudo-GT to promote generation of sharper lines.
- Introduces balanced twin perceptual loss combining both anime and photorealistic features to mitigate unwanted color artifacts.

Main Contributions:
- First anime image collection pipeline and API dataset capturing versatile anime scenes
- First image degradation model handling video compression artifacts restoration for anime SR 
- First pseudo-GT enhancement methodology to attentively sharpen hand-drawn lines
- Comprehensive study and solution of unwanted color artifacts issue in GAN-based anime SR
- Superior quantitative and qualitative performance over SOTA with 13.3% training complexity of prior arts

In summary, the paper provides extensive and meticulous contributions tailored for anime-specific challenges in real-world SR, outperforming previous arts by large margins.
