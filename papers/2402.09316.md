# [Only My Model On My Data: A Privacy Preserving Approach Protecting one   Model and Deceiving Unauthorized Black-Box Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09316)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sharing images online raises privacy concerns as images can be used to infer personal information about subjects. 
- Existing privacy preservation methods like encryption make images unrecognizable even to humans, while adversarial attacks prohibit inference even for authorized stakeholders.
- This paper tackles the problem of generating human-perceivable images that maintain accurate inference by an authorized model while evading unauthorized black-box models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a "feature map distortion" (FMD) method that generates perturbed images using only the authorized model. 
- The method optimizes a loss function with two terms: MSE between feature maps of original and perturbed images to distort features (transfers to unauthorized models), and cross-entropy loss of authorized model to maintain its accuracy.
- This allows images to retain one input-output path in the authorized model while disrupting paths in unauthorized models.

Contributions:
- First work to protect a known authorized model while deceiving unauthorized black-box models, keeping images human-perceivable.
- Evaluated on ImageNet, CelebA-HQ and AffectNet datasets with diverse models, achieving high protection accuracy while reducing unauthorized model accuracy significantly.
- Explored cross-task transferability to models with different objectives.
- Performed ablation studies on layer selection, parameters, image quality vs protection performance, and impact of task complexity.

In summary, the paper pioneers an important practical privacy preservation problem for image data, proposing a novel feature distortion solution that protects authorized models while disrupting unauthorized models in a black-box setting. Evaluations and analyses verify the efficacy of the approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach to generate human-perceivable images that maintain accurate inference for an authorized model while preventing unauthorized black-box models from making accurate inferences, even on different tasks, in order to address privacy concerns with image data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel method for protecting authorized models while deceiving unauthorized black-box models, in order to address privacy concerns with images. This is the first work to tackle this specific practical privacy preservation use case.

2) The proposed method can generate human-perceivable images that maintain accurate inference for an authorized model, while preventing accurate inference by other unauthorized black-box models, even if they have different objectives.

3) Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed method on three distinct datasets (ImageNet, Celeba-HQ, AffectNet) across diverse models. It achieves high protection accuracy for authorized models while significantly degrading unauthorized models.

4) Analysis is provided on why the proposed feature map distortion (FMD) approach is effective in transferring to unknown black-box models.

5) Ablation studies are performed to analyze different components of the method, including layer selection, parameter settings, image quality vs protection performance trade-off, and impact of task complexity.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating a novel privacy preservation method that protects authorized models while deceiving unauthorized black-box models by generating perceptually sensible images.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Privacy preservation
- Authorized model protection
- Black-box attack
- Feature map distortion (FMD)
- Transferable adversarial examples
- Image classification
- Facial recognition
- Facial emotion classification
- Cross-task transferability

The paper introduces a novel approach for protecting an authorized image classification model, while deceiving unauthorized black-box models trying to make inferences on the same images. It uses feature map distortion (FMD) to generate adversarial examples that are transferable to unknown target models. Experiments are conducted on image classification, facial recognition, and facial emotion classification tasks. Cross-task transferability to different types of models is also analyzed. The key focus is on preserving privacy by enabling accurate inference for authorized models while disabling it for unauthorized ones.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the feature maps of the original and perturbed images as the transferable loss. Why is feature map distortion chosen instead of other types of losses? What is the intuition behind using MSE for feature map distortion?

2. The loss function contains two competing terms - the MSE term to distort features and cross-entropy (CE) term to maintain accuracy of the authorized model. How does the interplay between these two terms allow protecting the authorized model while deceiving unauthorized ones? 

3. The method relies on the assumption that feature extraction layers are similar across models. Is there any analysis done in the paper to verify this assumption empirically? If not, how would you design experiments to analyze the similarity of feature maps across models?

4. For layer selection in computing the MSE loss, lower layers seem to provide better attack potency. What could be the potential reasons behind this observation? Can you hypothesize other criteria for intelligent layer selection?

5. The performance drops for unauthorized models are very significant for ImageNet and CelebA-HQ datasets but less so for AffectNet. What inferences can you draw about the nature of tasks or datasets that this approach works better for?

6. In analyzing the results, activation maps and softmax scores are visualized. What inferences do these visualizations allow you to make about why the method works? Can you think of other ways for analysis?

7. For parameter selection, how would you determine optimal settings in a principled way instead of empirical search? Can you define some metric to measure the quality of solutions? 

8. The cross-task experiments show that effectiveness depends on the model and task characteristics. What modifications would you suggest to improve transferability across diverse tasks?

9. The ablation studies analyze impact of various design choices empirically. Can you think of modelling the problem mathematically to analyze some of those choices more rigorously? 

10. The conclusion alludes to future work for maintaining effectiveness across tasks. What ideas do you have along those lines? What other future work directions seem promising to you?
