# [Self-Supervised Prototypical Transfer Learning for Few-Shot   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we develop an unsupervised transfer learning approach for few-shot classification that does not require costly annotated data for pre-training, yet achieves competitive performance with supervised methods?The central hypothesis appears to be:By learning a self-supervised embedding that clusters augmented views of unlabeled images during pre-training, the model can learn useful representations for few-shot classification without needing labels. This approach can achieve competitive performance to supervised methods when applied to few-shot tasks, while requiring significantly less labeled data.In summary, the key research direction is developing an unsupervised transfer learning technique for few-shot classification that can match the performance of supervised approaches without needing labels for pre-training. The main hypothesis is that a self-supervised contrastive pre-training approach can learn representations sufficient for effective few-shot classification when transferred to novel tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a self-supervised prototypical transfer learning approach for few-shot classification called ProtoTransfer. The main contributions are:- ProtoTransfer outperforms prior state-of-the-art unsupervised meta-learning methods on few-shot classification benchmarks like Omniglot and mini-ImageNet by learning representations without using any labels during pre-training.- In cross-domain few-shot learning settings with domain shift between training and test classes, ProtoTransfer achieves competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while using orders of magnitude fewer labels. - Through ablation studies and experiments reducing the training class diversity, the paper shows that using a large number of equivalent training classes and parametric fine-tuning are key components leading to ProtoTransfer's strong performance.- The paper provides insights into why the proposed self-supervised approach generalizes better from pre-training classes to novel test classes than common supervised pre-training.In summary, the main contribution is a new self-supervised transfer learning approach that achieves excellent few-shot classification performance without requiring any labels during pre-training. It outperforms prior unsupervised meta-learning techniques and reaches competitive performance to supervised methods when limited labeled data is available.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised transfer learning approach for few-shot classification that constructs an embedding to cluster augmented data points and uses this as initialization for prototypical networks, outperforming prior unsupervised meta-learning methods and achieving competitive performance to supervised approaches.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper comparing to other research in few-shot learning:- This paper proposes a new self-supervised pre-training approach called ProtoTransfer for few-shot classification. It does not rely on label information during pre-training, unlike most prior meta-learning methods. In this sense, it is similar to other recent works exploring unsupervised meta-learning like CACTUs, UMTRA, and AAL. However, ProtoTransfer moves away from the episodic training used in those methods.- The key idea in ProtoTransfer is to learn embeddings that cluster augmentations of the same image together, inspired by recent contrastive self-supervised learning techniques. The pre-training loss is like a self-supervised version of the prototypical loss from ProtoNets. This is a novel way to do unsupervised pre-training for few-shot learning.- Experiments show ProtoTransfer outperforms prior unsupervised meta-learning methods quite significantly on mini-ImageNet. It also achieves competitive performance to supervised approaches on mini-ImageNet and cross-domain datasets, while using far fewer labels. This demonstrates the power of self-supervision for few-shot learning.- Ablation studies provide insights into the benefits of using larger batch sizes compared to episodic training, and show fine-tuning in the target domain is important for handling domain shifts. The analysis of generalization gap also supports the idea that self-supervision leads to more transferable representations.- Overall, this work pushes the boundaries of unsupervised few-shot learning. By moving beyond episodic training and using self-supervision for pre-training, ProtoTransfer is able to learn more effective representations for few-shot tasks using unlabeled data. The results are state-of-the-art for unsupervised approaches and competitive with supervised techniques.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring other self-supervised pre-training objectives besides the contrastive prototypical loss used in this work. The authors suggest self-supervised clustering objectives as one possibility.- Applying ProtoTransfer to other domains beyond image classification, such as reinforcement learning environments. The authors propose that ProtoTransfer could be used to obtain useful representations of states.- Extending ProtoTransfer to the online/continual learning setting, where novel classes arrive sequentially rather than all at once in a batch. The authors suggest gradually expanding the prototypes over time.- Evaluating how different architectural choices interact with ProtoTransfer's self-supervised pre-training approach. The authors propose exploring deeper networks than the shallow ConvNets used in this work.- Analyzing the learned representations to understand what semantic concepts are captured by the self-supervised pre-training process. The authors suggest using techniques like network dissection.- Exploring whether fine-tuning the backbone network in addition to the classifier weights can improve performance in the presence of greater domain shift between pre-training and target tasks.In summary, the main future directions are exploring additional self-supervised objectives, applying ProtoTransfer to new domains like RL, extending it to online learning settings, analyzing the representations, and improving performance on challenging domain transfer tasks. The authors propose several interesting avenues to build upon their approach.
