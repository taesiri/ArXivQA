# [Self-Supervised Prototypical Transfer Learning for Few-Shot   Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11325)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:How can we develop an unsupervised transfer learning approach for few-shot classification that does not require costly annotated data for pre-training, yet achieves competitive performance with supervised methods?The central hypothesis appears to be:By learning a self-supervised embedding that clusters augmented views of unlabeled images during pre-training, the model can learn useful representations for few-shot classification without needing labels. This approach can achieve competitive performance to supervised methods when applied to few-shot tasks, while requiring significantly less labeled data.In summary, the key research direction is developing an unsupervised transfer learning technique for few-shot classification that can match the performance of supervised approaches without needing labels for pre-training. The main hypothesis is that a self-supervised contrastive pre-training approach can learn representations sufficient for effective few-shot classification when transferred to novel tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a self-supervised prototypical transfer learning approach for few-shot classification called ProtoTransfer. The main contributions are:- ProtoTransfer outperforms prior state-of-the-art unsupervised meta-learning methods on few-shot classification benchmarks like Omniglot and mini-ImageNet by learning representations without using any labels during pre-training.- In cross-domain few-shot learning settings with domain shift between training and test classes, ProtoTransfer achieves competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while using orders of magnitude fewer labels. - Through ablation studies and experiments reducing the training class diversity, the paper shows that using a large number of equivalent training classes and parametric fine-tuning are key components leading to ProtoTransfer's strong performance.- The paper provides insights into why the proposed self-supervised approach generalizes better from pre-training classes to novel test classes than common supervised pre-training.In summary, the main contribution is a new self-supervised transfer learning approach that achieves excellent few-shot classification performance without requiring any labels during pre-training. It outperforms prior unsupervised meta-learning techniques and reaches competitive performance to supervised methods when limited labeled data is available.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a self-supervised transfer learning approach for few-shot classification that constructs an embedding to cluster augmented data points and uses this as initialization for prototypical networks, outperforming prior unsupervised meta-learning methods and achieving competitive performance to supervised approaches.
