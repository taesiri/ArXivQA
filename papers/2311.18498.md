# [Data-Agnostic Model Poisoning against Federated Learning: A Graph   Autoencoder Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18498)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel data-agnostic model poisoning attack against federated learning (FL) systems. The attack involves an adversarial graph autoencoder (GAE) framework that enables the attacker to extract the correlations between benign local models and manipulate them to generate malicious local models. Specifically, the attacker decomposes the benign local models into a graph structure capturing model correlations and underlying data features. It then uses a GCN-based encoder and decoder to reconstruct an adversarial graph structure that retains feature correlations while maximizing the FL loss. This structure is combined with the genuine data features to produce malicious local models that appear compatible with benign ones. A rigorous analysis proves FL convergence under attack but with suboptimal performance. Experiments using SVM models on MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR datasets show the attack gradually reduces accuracy while evading detection. By exploiting model correlations, the GAE attack can infect all devices without needing access to actual training data. This poses a serious threat to FL security, privacy and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new data-agnostic model poisoning attack on federated learning using an adversarial graph autoencoder framework to extract and manipulate the correlations between benign local models, maximizing the training loss while evading detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new design of data-agnostic, malicious local models, which manipulates the correlations of benign local models and retains the genuine data features substantiating the benign local models.

2. A new graph autoencoder (GAE) framework, which is trained together with sub-gradient descent to regenerate manipulatively the correlations of the local models while keeping the malicious local models undetectable. 

3. A rigorous analysis, which proves the convergence of the global model under attack, but to an inferior optimality gap.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel data-agnostic model poisoning attack on federated learning using an adversarial graph autoencoder approach. The key ideas are to extract and reconstruct the structural correlations between benign local models to generate effective yet stealthy malicious updates, without needing access to the private training data. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the attack in gradually compromising model accuracy over communication rounds.
