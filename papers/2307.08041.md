# [Planting a SEED of Vision in Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08041)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can discrete visual tokens be designed to effectively align with and empower large language models for both visual comprehension and generation tasks?

The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Image tokens should have a 1D causal dependency (rather than 2D context) to align with the autoregressive nature of LLMs. 

2) Image tokens should capture high-level semantics on par with words to enable effective alignment between vision and language.

3) An image tokenizer optimized for both discriminative and generative reconstruction can produce compatible discrete codes for comprehension and generation.

4) With a proper tokenizer, an LLM can readily perform both text-to-image and image-to-text generation after simple tuning, exhibiting emergent multimodal capabilities.

In summary, the central research question focuses on how to design a discrete visual tokenizer that facilitates versatile multimodal abilities in LLMs, with hypotheses about causal dependency, semantic level, and training objectives. The paper aims to demonstrate emergent comprehension and generation abilities with proper tokenization and simple tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes SEED, a new image tokenizer that produces discrete visual tokens with 1D causal dependency and high-level semantics. This design makes the visual tokens more compatible with large language models (LLMs).

2. It shows that by incorporating SEED, an off-the-shelf LLM can be readily equipped to perform both image-to-text and text-to-image generation after simple tuning. This demonstrates the potential of discrete visual tokens in enabling versatile multimodal LLMs. 

3. It identifies two key principles for designing visual tokenizers to facilitate multimodal training of LLMs: (i) using 1D causal dependency instead of 2D context, and (ii) capturing high-level semantics on par with words. 

4. It demonstrates promising results on multimodal tasks like image captioning, VQA, and text-to-image generation using SEED tokens and a tuned OPT-2.7B model. The model was trained efficiently in just 5.7 days on 64 V100 GPUs.

5. It emphasizes the importance of proper visual tokenization for advancing multimodal LLMs, and shows the promise of discrete tokens in achieving unified multimodal capabilities in LLMs with simple autoregressive training.

In summary, this paper proposes a better discrete visual tokenizer design and shows its potential in enabling emergent multimodal abilities in LLMs via simple tuning, taking a step towards versatile multimodal LLMs. The principles identified for visual tokenizers are also an important contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SEED, an image tokenizer that converts images into discrete visual tokens with 1D causal dependency and high-level semantics, enabling large language models to perform both visual comprehension and generation tasks through efficient multimodal autoregressive pre-training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work on multimodal large language models:

- It focuses on the design of the visual tokenizer, which converts images to discrete tokens. Many other papers put more emphasis on the multimodal pretraining or fine-tuning stages. This paper argues a proper tokenizer design is crucial for aligning visual and textual representations.

- The proposed SEED tokenizer generates 1D sequences of visual tokens with causal dependency. This aligns better with the left-to-right autoregressive mechanism in standard language models compared to 2D tokenized image patches. 

- SEED is designed to capture high-level visual semantics, similar to the level of abstraction in text. This differs from some tokenizers that focus on lower-level pixel reconstruction.

- The paper shows both visual comprehension and generation abilities can emerge in a single model by incorporating the SEED tokenizer into a standard language model. Many other papers focus on either comprehension or generation.

- Efficient tuning with a low-rank adapter allows mimicking a multimodal transformer with 5M image-text pairs rather than requiring huge datasets. Other concurrent work uses orders of magnitude more data.

- The approach is benchmarked on established comprehension and generation tasks like image captioning and text-to-image synthesis. But there is no claim of state-of-the-art results, just demonstrating capabilities.

In summary, this paper provides a new perspective by emphasizing the tokenizer design and showing initial results on joint comprehension and generation with relatively limited data resources. The ideas could inform further work on more scalable and unified multimodal LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling up training for a better tokenizer. The authors note that future work can further scale up training of the SEED visual tokenizer to improve its capabilities.

- Leveraging stronger LLMs for more comprehensive multimodal pretraining and tuning. The authors suggest leveraging larger and more powerful LLMs like LLaMA for more extensive multimodal pretraining on image-text data and instruction tuning on downstream tasks. 

- Exploring different prompting techniques. The authors used simple prompting with phrases like "a photo of" for image captioning, but suggest exploring different prompting approaches could further improve performance.

- Extensive evaluations on more datasets and tasks. The authors evaluated on a limited set of datasets and modalities, so suggest more comprehensive benchmarking on diverse multimodal tasks.

- Investigating different tokenizer architectures. The authors propose causal 1D dependency and high-level semantics as useful principles, but think exploring other tokenizer designs may lead to further improvements.

- Studying what visual concepts are learned and represented. The authors are interested in analyzing what high-level visual concepts and abstractions are captured by the discrete visual tokens.

- Reducing the carbon footprint of training. The authors suggest the discrete visual tokens may enable more efficient, lower carbon large-scale multimodal training.

In summary, the main future directions are developing better tokenizers, leveraging larger LLMs, exploring prompting and training techniques, comprehensive benchmarking, studying learned representations, and reducing carbon footprint. The authors are excited about the future potential of discrete visual tokens in versatile multimodal LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents SEED, a new image tokenizer that enables large language models (LLMs) to perform both visual comprehension and visual generation tasks. SEED produces discrete visual tokens with 1D causal dependency and high-level semantics, making them compatible with the left-to-right autoregressive prediction of LLMs. Specifically, SEED uses a causal transformer to convert 2D image features into a 1D sequence, quantizes the features into discrete codes, and aligns them with text embeddings. SEED is optimized for both discriminativeness and reconstruction during training. When incorporated into an LLM through efficient tuning, SEED allows the model to perform zero-shot image captioning, visual QA, and text-to-image generation after training on just 5M image-text pairs. The design of SEED emphasizes the importance of proper image tokenization to enable scalable and versatile multimodal LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces SEED, a novel image tokenizer designed to enable large language models (LLMs) to perform both visual comprehension and generation tasks. SEED produces discrete visual tokens with a 1D causal dependency that aligns with the autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. It also captures high-level semantic information consistent with the abstraction level of words. 

The SEED tokenizer converts images into causal semantic embeddings using a Causal Q-Former module. These embeddings are quantized into discrete codes by a VQ codebook. A Reverse Q-Former decodes codes into generation embeddings aligned with Stable Diffusion, allowing image generation. SEED is optimized for discriminative and reconstructive objectives. When incorporated into an LLM via lightweight tuning, SEED enables emergent comprehension abilities like image captioning and VQA, and generation abilities like text-to-image synthesis. The simple integration and strong results suggest the potential of discrete visual tokens to unlock versatile multimodal capabilities in LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents SEED, an elaborate image tokenizer that enables large language models (LLMs) to perform both visual comprehension and generation tasks. SEED produces discrete visual tokens with 1D causal dependency and high-level semantics. This aligns with the left-to-right autoregressive prediction mechanism in LLMs. Specifically, SEED uses a ViT encoder and UNet decoder from pre-trained models. A Causal Q-Former converts 2D features into 1D causal embeddings, which are discretized by a VQ codebook. A Reverse Q-Former decodes the discrete codes into generation embeddings aligned with the Stable Diffusion latent space. SEED is optimized for discriminativeness via contrastive learning and reconstruction of embeddings and text features. This captures essential semantics for comprehension and generation. The authors show SEED tokens enable efficient tuning of LLMs via LoRA for unified multimodal autoregression. This yields promising results on image captioning, VQA, and text-to-image generation after just 5M examples. The study emphasizes the potential of discrete tokens for versatile multimodal LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to effectively equip large language models (LLMs) with visual understanding and generation capabilities in a unified framework. Specifically:

- Recent work has shown success in using LLMs for either visual understanding (e.g. image captioning) or visual generation (e.g. text-to-image synthesis) separately. However, achieving both capabilities together in a single LLM remains challenging. 

- Existing approaches for incorporating vision into LLMs have limitations. Using continuous visual features makes alignment with discrete textual tokens difficult. Using pixel-based discrete visual tokens captures low-level details but lacks semantic abstraction needed for language alignment. 

- The authors propose that proper design of a visual tokenizer is crucial to enable seamless fusion of vision and language in LLMs. Their goal is to develop a discrete visual tokenizer that captures high-level semantics and generates tokens with 1D causal dependency compatible with LLM architecture.

- They present SEED, a novel VQ-based visual tokenizer tailored for LLM integration through these design principles. They show SEED tokens allow efficient tuning of LLM for joint visual understanding and generation tasks like captioning and text-to-image synthesis.

In summary, the main problem is developing a visual tokenizer for LLMs that facilitates emergent multimodal capabilities spanning both understanding and generation grounded in vision and language. SEED is proposed as an effective solution aligned with LLM architecture.
