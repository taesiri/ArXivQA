# [Resilience of Entropy Model in Distributed Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00942)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Distributed deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged to reduce communication overhead between edge devices and cloud servers. Recently, entropy coding was introduced to further minimize latency by compressing intermediate representations. 
- However, the resilience of entropy models to intentional (adversarial attacks) and unintentional (weather changes, motion blur) interference is unexplored. Such interference could significantly increase transmission bandwidth usage.

Key Ideas:  
- Conduct extensive experiments with 3 DNN architectures, 2 entropy models and 4 rate-distortion factors to analyze impact of interference.
- Intentional attacks can increase communication overhead by up to 95% while unintentional events also considerably affect bandwidth.
- Visualizations reveal entropy models learn different features than task-specific DNNs. Attacks target background regions to increase bit rate while minimally impacting accuracy.  
- Propose defense method involving object-aware total variation denoising to remove vulnerable high-frequency components.

Main Contributions:
- First investigation of resilience of entropy coding in distributed DNNs to interference.
- Analysis and visualization of distinct compression features learned by entropy models. 
- Standalone defense approach that reduces transmission overhead of attacked inputs by 9% with only 2% accuracy loss. Approach is generalizable and compatible with other defense methods.

In summary, the paper thoroughly evaluates for the first time the vulnerability of entropy coding to various interference types in distributed DNN setting. The findings enable an effective defense strategy to safeguard compression features while preserving accuracy.
