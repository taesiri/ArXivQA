# [Prediction of Wort Density with LSTM Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06458)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Measuring physical properties like wort density during beer brewing is error-prone, cumbersome, and expensive with traditional methods. 
- Traditional methods like using a saccharometer require taking manual measurements, which interrupts the fermentation process.
- There is a need for an automated soft sensor approach to predict wort density.

Proposed Solution:
- Gather data from low-cost sensors - pressure, temperature during fermentation process. Also record timestamp and saccharometer measurements.  
- Build predictive model using long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network that takes time-series sensor data as input and predicts wort density.
- LSTM chosen because fermentation is a dynamic, time-variant process.
- Data stacked into frames (100 time steps x 6 features) to train LSTM network implemented in Keras.

Key Contributions:
- Developed automated soft sensor method to predict wort density using easy-to-install pressure and temperature sensors
- Reduces need for cumbersome manual saccharometer measurements 
- LSTM approach models time-dynamics of fermentation process
- Achieved prediction error within 0.6 Â°Plato in successful test cases
- Proposed improvements like controlled fermentation, using refractometer, and additional sensors to further enhance predictions

In summary, the paper presents a novel soft sensor solution using LSTM neural network to predict wort density during beer fermentation, providing a more automated and less disruptive approach than traditional manual measurements. Key aspects are the data gathering system, LSTM network architecture, and demonstration of promising prediction capability on real fermentation data.
