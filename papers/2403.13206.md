# [Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13206)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Depth-guided NeRF Training via Earth Mover's Distance":

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can render high-quality novel views of a scene, but often fail to capture the underlying 3D geometry accurately. This limits their use for applications like robotics or AR.
- Incorporating depth supervision from monocular depth networks during training can help improve geometric understanding. However, depth predictions have inherent ambiguity and uncertainty that is not sufficiently captured by existing methods.

Solution:
- Propose a novel framework to incorporate pixel-wise uncertainty in monocular depth priors to guide NeRF training, without restrictive assumptions.
- Use diffusion models like DiffDP for depth prediction to get uncertainty for free from the generation process. Compare depth predictions over time and between original/mirrored images.
- Guide the distribution of ray termination distances in NeRF using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) loss between samples and depth prior. Allows selective supervision without enforcing incorrect depths.
- Weigh photometric and EMD losses based on uncertainty to rely more on RGB loss when depth is unreliable.

Main Contributions:
- Novel way to capture uncertainty in monocular depth priors using diffusion models, without assumptions about error distribution.
- First use of EMD loss to guide ray termination sampling in NeRF based on depth prior, enabling selective and robust supervision.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art depth-supervised NeRF methods on depth metrics by 11-54% on ScanNet scenes, with comparable RGB reconstruction.
- Achieves lower depth errors than the priors themselves, showing the model learns to improve over initial geometry suggestions.
- Simpler than custom-training ambiguity-aware depth priors, while being more robust.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient and uncertainty-aware framework to incorporate monocular depth guidance in NeRF training that selectively supervises based on reliability, leading to improved geometric reconstruction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to incorporate monocular depth priors to supervise neural radiance field training that uses Earth Mover's Distance to guide the ray termination distance distribution and leverages the inherent uncertainty estimates from diffusion models, outperforming prior depth-supervised NeRF methods on depth metrics while maintaining photometric quality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel approach to incorporate uncertainty in monocular depth priors for neural radiance field (NeRF) training. Specifically:

1) They propose to use off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion models (e.g. DiffDP) to predict depth and capture uncertainty during the denoising process. This provides accurate depth priors and uncertainties for free.

2) They propose to supervise the ray termination distance distribution in NeRF using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) instead of enforcing the rendered depth to replicate the (imperfect) depth prior exactly through L2 loss. This allows the depth prior to guide NeRF training without strictly enforcing it. 

3) They propose a way to balance the photometric and geometric losses during NeRF training based on the uncertainty maps from the diffusion models. This allows putting more weight on the RGB loss in areas where the depth prior is more uncertain.

Overall, their method outperforms previous depth-supervised NeRF methods by a large margin on depth metrics while maintaining RGB reconstruction quality. The key ideas are leveraging uncertainty information from diffusion models, using EMD loss for flexible depth guidance, and balancing losses based on estimated uncertainty.

The paper proposes a new method for depth-guided training of neural radiance fields using monocular depth priors and Earth Mover's Distance to supervise the ray termination distance distribution. Key ideas include leveraging uncertainty estimates from denoising diffusion models, avoiding direct depth supervision via EMD which allows selective incorporation of depth priors, and balancing photometric and geometric losses inspired by focal loss. The method is evaluated on ScanNet scenes and shown to outperform prior depth-supervised NeRF methods on depth metrics while maintaining photometric performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper argues that directly supervising the NeRF-rendered depth with an L2 loss can lead to incorrectly enforcing the depth prior. How does the proposed EMD loss provide more flexibility in leveraging the depth prior? What assumptions does EMD relax compared to other losses?

2) The uncertainty measure from DiffDP seems crucial for identifying unreliable areas in the depth prior. How exactly is this uncertainty quantified during the diffusion model's iterative denoising process? How does this capture notion of uncertainty differ from other methods?  

3) The paper demonstrates that having multiple ambiguous depth hypotheses does not necessarily help resolve ambiguity. What was the analysis done to arrive at this conclusion in Figure 4? How does the proposed method handle multi-modality instead?

4) Loss weighting is inspired by Focal Loss, but provides less weight when uncertain instead of more. What is the motivation behind this design choice? How does the ablation study in Figure 5 support the utility of uncertainty weighting?

5) How reliable are the depth metrics for evaluating geometric accuracy, given that good RGB reconstruction quality does not necessarily imply correct geometry? Are there additional analyses that can further validate the improved understanding of scene geometry?

6) For outdoor scenes, what might explain why the indoor-trained DiffDP depth prior still works reasonably well compared to the outdoor-trained MiDaS prior used in DäRF? How can the uncertainty map compensate?

7) The method assumes a static, non-generative depth prior. Could this framework be extended to leverage iterative, generative refinement of depth hypotheses over the course of NeRF training? 

8) How does the hyperparameter search and tuning compare between the proposed approach and SOTA methods like SCADE or DäRF? Is the pipeline sensitivity to hyperparameters a limitation?

9) Could the uncertainty-weighted EMD loss potentially improve training in other settings where ambiguous or unreliable priors are available, such as occlusion-aware depth supervision or flow prediction?

10) What other techniques can complement the proposed approach to handle more complex indoor environments? For example, how could the method deal with transparent, reflective, or textureless regions where RGB supervision is also unreliable?
