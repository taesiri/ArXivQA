# [On Meta-Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06562)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes using category theory to model large language models (LLMs) and their behavior when executing prompts. Specifically, it introduces the Prompt category to represent all possible LLM applications, and task-categories as subcategories representing specific tasks like summarization or dialog. A key contribution is the concept of meta-prompt morphisms, which map user-provided context to appropriate prompts for the task, making them task-agnostic. Through this framework, the paper shows meta-prompting approaches are more effective at generating desirable outputs than fixed prompts. Experiments in ideation and creativity tasks support this, with users ranking meta-generated prompts and outputs as significantly more suitable than basic baselines. Overall, the category theory perspective allows formal modeling of complex LLM properties, while meta-prompting improves prompt engineering to handle user contexts better. The framework is flexible enough to capture higher-behaviors like generalizability too.
