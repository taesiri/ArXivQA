# [Provable Filter for Real-world Graph Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03666)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph clustering is an important unsupervised learning problem but has proven challenging for graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve effectively. 
- Most methods assume graphs exhibit homophily (connected nodes belong to same cluster) and fail on heterophilic graphs (connected nodes belong to different clusters). 
- Real-world graphs exhibit a mixture of both homophilic and heterophilic edges, known as structural disparity. Principled ways to handle such graphs are lacking.

Key Idea:
- The paper first empirically finds that homophilic and heterophilic edges can be distinguished by looking at neighbor similarities - homophilic edges have high neighbor overlap while heterophilic edges have low overlap.
- Based on this, the paper develops unsupervised strategies to construct two graphs capturing primarily homophilic and heterophilic edges respectively. 

Proposed Solution:
- A novel graph filter is proposed that applies global aggregation to the homophilic graph and local aggregation to the heterophilic graph. This filter adaptively captures both low and high frequency signals.
- A squeeze-and-excitation block further enhances important learned features. 
- The method provably improves cluster discrimination by reducing intra-cluster distances and increasing inter-cluster distances.

Contributions:
- Novel graph restructuring strategies to extract homophilic and heterophilic information
- New graph filter with theoretical support to handle mixture of homophily
- First application of squeeze-and-excitation concept to graph clustering
- State-of-the-art performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark graphs  

In summary, the paper develops an innovative graph clustering approach to address challenges posed by real-world graphs exhibiting varying levels of homophily. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
