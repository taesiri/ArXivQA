## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces xNeuSM, a novel framework for explainable neural subgraph matching that aims to address limitations in prior neural approaches lacking interpretability while achieving superior performance over existing exact and approximate algorithms. A core contribution is the Graph Learnable Multi-hop Attention Networks (GLeMA) module that adaptively learns node-specific attention decay factors to capture high-order dependencies. Theoretical analysis is provided on the approximation error of multi-hop attention and correctness of learning distinct attention factors per node. Additionally, a multi-task learning strategy is proposed to concurrently optimize subgraph matching and matching explanation objectives. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate xNeuSM's substantial improvements in runtime and accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques for subgraph matching. The model also showcases precise identification of node mappings, evidencing its capability for matching explanation. Ablation studies validate the efficacy of individual components in xNeuSM's architecture. Evaluations also explore its generalizability, scalability and applicability to directed graphs and inductive settings. Overall, xNeuSM achieves superior performance and interpretability, presenting a practical solution for real-world tasks demanding subgraph matching and pattern analysis in large graphs.
