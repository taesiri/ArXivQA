# [Enhancing Robotic Navigation: An Evaluation of Single and   Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07953)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a comparative analysis between traditional single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms and multi-objective RL (MORL) for robotic navigation tasks. The authors evaluate popular single-objective RL methods - Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) - in simulation using Gazebo. Despite gradual improvements, these algorithms demonstrate suboptimal performance with frequent collisions, inability to find efficient paths, and poor balancing of navigation objectives like avoiding obstacles and minimizing time. To address these limitations, the authors propose applying MORL which uses a vectorized reward function, allowing the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Through modifications to the reward structure, preferences can be encoded for safer or faster navigation. While illustrating the issues with single-objective methods, this paper sets the groundwork for further analysis into MORL for enabling more adaptable and robust robotic behaviors across complex, real-world environments.
