# [Diverse 3D Hand Gesture Prediction from Body Dynamics by Bilateral Hand   Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01765)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to predict natural and diverse 3D hand gestures from body dynamics. The key challenges it aims to tackle are:

1) Asymmetric motions of the two hands - previous works often overlook this and generate hands holistically, leading to unnatural results. 

2) Temporal consistency with body dynamics - predicted hand gestures should be temporally consistent with the body motion sequence.

3) Non-deterministic hand prediction - given a body motion sequence, there can be multiple plausible and diverse hand gesture predictions rather than just one deterministic output.

To address these challenges, the main hypothesis is a two-stage prediction and diversification approach with disentangled hand branches can generate more natural and diverse hand gestures from body dynamics. The key ideas proposed are:

- Bilateral hand disentanglement to model asymmetric hand motions 
- Spatial-residual and temporal-motion memory modules to capture body-hand spatial-temporal interactions
- Diversification of hand predictions in the second stage via prototypical memory sampling 

In summary, the paper focuses on the problem of generating natural and diverse 3D hand gestures from body dynamics, with the main hypothesis being a two-stage disentangled prediction and diversification approach can achieve this effectively.
