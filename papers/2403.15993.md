# [Robust-Locomotion-by-Logic: Perturbation-Resilient Bipedal Locomotion   via Signal Temporal Logic Guided Model Predictive Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15993)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bipedal robots have potential for agile maneuvers but can lack resilience to perturbations like pushes or uneven terrain. Existing control methods struggle to systematically evaluate and ensure robustness.
- Crossed-leg recovery maneuvers are useful but optimizing for them introduces leg collision risks. Prior methods use simple heuristics that limit solutions.

Proposed Solution:
- A model predictive control (MPC) method that incorporates signal temporal logic (STL) specifications to enhance locomotion robustness and enable crossed-leg maneuvers.
- STL specifications formally encode high-level locomotion objectives like stability, step bound limits, etc. and quantify robustness.
- Optimizing for STL specification satisfaction and robustness generates optimal foothold locations and swing trajectories.
- Learned neural network constraints accurately and rapidly estimate leg distances to enable crossed-leg motions.  

Contributions:
- First incorporation of STL specifications into trajectory optimization for legged systems.
- New reduced-order model retains ability to check full leg collisions while optimizable.
- Riemannian robustness metric tailored for bipedal systems integrated through STL specifications.
- Data-driven leg distance approximations enable fast, accurate collision avoidance.
- Demonstrated substantial improvements in allowable perturbation forces compared to state-of-the-art methods in simulation (>80% in key scenarios) and hardware experiments.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel integration of STL specifications in MPC to significantly improve bipedal locomotion resilience to perturbations while enabling complex recovery behaviors.
