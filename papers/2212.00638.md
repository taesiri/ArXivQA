# [Finetune like you pretrain: Improved finetuning of zero-shot vision   models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00638)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central hypothesis of this paper is that finetuning vision models like CLIP in a manner that closely matches the pretraining objective leads to better performance compared to standard finetuning approaches. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a finetuning approach called "Finetune Like You Pretrain" (FLYP) which continues to train the model using the same contrastive loss as pretraining, just augmented with labeled data. The key hypothesis is that this approach will outperform standard finetuning techniques like cross-entropy training or two-stage methods like linear probing followed by finetuning. 

The paper presents extensive experiments across a variety of distribution shift, transfer learning, and few-shot classification tasks. The consistent finding is that FLYP outperforms alternative finetuning methods, often by significant margins. For example, FLYP improves accuracy by 4.2% on average across 7 distribution shift datasets compared to standard finetuning.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that matching the pretraining and finetuning objectives leads to better performance. The paper presents FLYP as a straightforward way to achieve this match for vision models, and shows through empirical results that it consistently improves accuracy across diverse tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a method called "Finetune Like You Pretrain" (FLYP) for finetuning vision models that have been pretrained on image-text data, like CLIP. The key ideas are:

- Instead of using cross-entropy loss for finetuning like standard methods, FLYP continues to use the contrastive loss that was used during pretraining. 

- During finetuning, class labels are cast as text prompts and the model is trained to align image embeddings with the prompt embeddings, just like during pretraining.

- This approach consistently outperforms standard finetuning and recent innovations like linear probing + finetuning in terms of accuracy on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets.

- The gains hold across various settings - distribution shift, transfer learning, and few-shot learning. For example, FLYP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on WILDS datasets.

- FLYP is simple to implement as it just uses the same loss as pretraining. The surprising effectiveness of this naive approach over more complex methods is the main contribution.

In summary, the key contribution is showing that continuing to train vision models with the pretraining contrastive loss, using class labels as prompts, is a surprisingly effective yet simple finetuning approach that outperforms existing methods across various settings.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of robust vision model finetuning:

- This paper focuses on finetuning image-text models like CLIP in a robust way. Other recent works like LP-FT and WiseFT have proposed modifications to finetuning to improve robustness, usually at the cost of some in-distribution (ID) accuracy. 

- This paper shows that a simple approach of using the same contrastive loss from pretraining consistently outperforms these prior methods in both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy. The gains are shown on a variety of datasets and models, establishing the effectiveness of this approach.

- The main novelty is showing that this naive finetuning method works better than more complex proposals from prior work. The paper clearly compares performance to existing state-of-the-art methods like LP-FT and weight ensembling.

- The finetuning method itself is quite simple and not entirely novel - some prior works have used similar contrastive losses. However, the key contribution is rigorously benchmarking against other methods and showing strong empirical performance.

- The ablations provide some insight into why this approach works well, ruling out some possible explanations. But the core reasons behind its effectiveness are still not fully understood.

- Overall, this paper makes a solid incremental contribution over a line of work focused on robust vision model finetuning. The empirical gains on various datasets help clearly establish this simple finetuning method as an effective approach compared to prior art.

In summary, while the finetuning method is simple, the paper's contribution is in comprehensive benchmarking and showing gains over recent complex innovations for robust finetuning. The results suggest this approach should be strongly considered as a standard finetuning technique going forward.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore the generality of the "finetune like you pretrain" principle for other modalities and models beyond vision-language models like CLIP. The authors suggest it would be valuable to study if matching the pretraining and finetuning losses leads to gains in other domains like natural language processing or multimodal learning.

- Evaluate this approach of using the pretraining loss for finetuning in other zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. The paper focuses on image classification, but the authors suggest extending this to other low-data regimes could further demonstrate the broad viability of this method.

- Combine the proposed finetuning approach with other techniques like selectively updating parameters or regularization methods. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of just using the pretraining loss, but combining with other proposed heuristics may lead to further improvements.

- Better understand theoretically why finetuning with the pretraining loss works better than alternatives. The paper empirically demonstrates the consistent gains, but analyzing the underlying reasons for why this simple technique outperforms remains an open question. 

- Study whether properties like batch size, which are known to impact contrastive learning, also affect the efficacy of contrastive finetuning. The impact of such hyperparameters could further elucidate the similarities and differences between pretraining and finetuning.

Overall, the main suggested directions are around broadening the empirical study of this method to new settings and models, combining it with other proposed techniques, and elucidating the theoretical underpinnings behind why this straightforward approach seems to work so well across diverse tasks and datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called Finetune Like You Pretrain (FLYP) for finetuning image-text models like CLIP on downstream classification tasks. The key idea is to continue finetuning CLIP using the same contrastive loss function that was used during pretraining, rather than switching to a standard cross-entropy loss like most methods do. Given a labeled image, FLYP constructs a text prompt for the corresponding class label, and optimizes the contrastive loss between the image and prompt embeddings. Experiments across a range of distribution shift, transfer learning, and few-shot benchmarks show FLYP consistently outperforms standard finetuning techniques like linear probing and full finetuning. It also beats more recent innovations like LP-FT and weight ensembling. The gains highlight the benefits of matching the pretraining and finetuning losses. Ablation experiments indicate the contrastive loss itself and joint updating of vision and text encoders are critical for FLYP's strong performance. Overall, FLYP provides a simple and effective finetuning approach for image-text models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a simple yet effective method for finetuning image-text models like CLIP called Finetune Like You Pretrain (FLYP). The key idea is that instead of using the standard cross-entropy loss for finetuning, FLYP continues to optimize the contrastive pretraining loss during finetuning. Specifically, the class labels are cast as text prompts and the contrastive loss continues to be optimized between the image embeddings and the class-descriptive prompt embeddings. 

The method is evaluated extensively on distribution shift, transfer learning, and few-shot classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that FLYP consistently outperforms standard finetuning methods like linear probing and full finetuning as well as recent innovations like LP-FT. For example, on ImageNet it improves average OOD accuracy over 5 distribution shifts by 4.2% compared to full finetuning. The gains hold even with weight ensembling, where FLYP outperforms LP-FT on average by over 1% on both ID and OOD accuracy. Overall, the consistent gains across models, datasets and settings indicate that continuing to optimize the pretraining objective is a simple yet highly effective approach for finetuning vision-language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for finetuning image-text models called Finetune Like You Pretrain (FLYP). The key idea is that instead of using the standard cross-entropy loss for finetuning, they continue to optimize the contrastive loss used during pretraining. Specifically, given a batch of labeled image samples, they construct corresponding text prompts using the class labels and sample from a distribution over possible text descriptions. They then update the model parameters via stochastic gradient descent on the same contrastive pretraining loss using these constructed image-text pairs. This has the effect of continuing to align the image embeddings with prompt embeddings of the corresponding classes. At inference time, predictions are made similarly to the zero-shot setting by computing similarity of image embeddings with prompt embeddings of each class. The main contribution is showing across various datasets and models that this intuitive approach consistently outperforms standard finetuning methods and recent state-of-the-art techniques like linear probing followed by finetuning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes an improved finetuning method for zero-shot image classification models like CLIP. The key points are:

- Recent works have shown that standard finetuning approaches like full finetuning or linear probing can degrade out-of-distribution robustness of pretrained CLIP models, even though they improve in-distribution accuracy. 

- This paper proposes a simple finetuning approach called "Finetune Like You Pretrain" (FLYP) which continues to train the model using the same contrastive pretraining loss, but using the labeled data from downstream tasks. 

- FLYP consistently outperforms standard finetuning and recent improvements like linear probing + finetuning (LP-FT) on a variety of distribution shift, few-shot, and transfer learning benchmarks.

- For example, on ImageNet it improves accuracy by 1-2% both in-distribution and out-of-distribution compared to LP-FT. On WILDS datasets like iWildCam, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming top methods by 2-3%.

- Ablation experiments indicate that using the contrastive loss itself seems key, as opposed to factors like updating text encoder or using prompt structure. Matching finetuning to pretraining appears important.

In summary, the paper proposes a simple but effective finetuning approach for CLIP models that matches the pretraining objective and shows it outperforms existing approaches on various benchmarks. The key contribution is highlighting this straightforward method delivers strong empirical gains across diverse settings.
