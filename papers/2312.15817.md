## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Developing realistic perception sensor models is critical for virtual testing and validation of automated driving systems (ADS), as well as for generating synthetic datasets to train perception models. However, there exists a large gap between simulated and real sensor data, known as the sim-to-real gap, which undermines these applications. Bridging this gap for Lidar point clouds is especially challenging due to their complex attributes like depth, reflectance and missing points (raydrop).

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a novel Contrastive-Learning-based Sim-to-Real mapping (CLS2R) framework to transform simulated Lidar point clouds into highly realistic outputs. The key components of CLS2R are:

1) Lossless projection of Lidar point cloud into depth, reflectance and auxiliary images like semantics.

2) A encoder-decoder network with a novel raydrop synthesis module to model complete scans and raydrop mask separately using a reparameterization trick during training. 

3) Adversarial and contrastive losses to ensure realistic yet faithful translation.

Main Contributions:

1) CLS2R framework that models all essential attributes - depth, reflectance and raydrop to achieve state-of-the-art sim-to-real translation performance.

2) Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations assessing realness, faithfulness and impact on downstream tasks. CLS2R outperforms other methods on majority of metrics.

3) A new diverse, annotated synthetic dataset called Semantic-CARLA to enable future research in this domain.

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions towards bridging the simmering gap, especially for Lidar point clouds, through an innovative adversarial contrastive learning approach. Both the framework and dataset are valuable for testing ADS as well as generating robust perception models.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel framework, called CLS2R, for sim-to-real mapping of Lidar point clouds using contrastive learning. The framework outperforms state-of-the-art image-to-image translation techniques on most evaluation metrics related to realness, faithfulness, and downstream task performance.

2. A new publicly accessible dataset called Semantic-CARLA, consisting of synthetic, point-wise annotated Lidar point clouds and RGB images of driving scenes. This is created to facilitate research on sim-to-real mapping for autonomous driving. 

3. A comprehensive evaluation of the CLS2R framework using quantitative metrics like FID, SWD, etc. as well as a downstream semantic segmentation task. The ablation study also analyzes the impact of different components like raydrop synthesis and contrastive learning.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel CLS2R framework for more realistic simulation-to-real-world mapping of Lidar data, along with the dataset and extensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness.
