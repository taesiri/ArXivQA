# [Taming Uncertainty in Sparse-view Generalizable NeRF via Indirect   Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Generalizable neural radiance fields (Gen-NeRFs) have been proposed to enable novel view synthesis of scenes without requiring per-scene optimization as in vanilla NeRF. They achieve generalization by incorporating scene-specific geometric features as conditional inputs to NeRF. However, when the input views are sparse, there will be large unobserved regions in the target view. The features obtained via reprojection for these regions can be highly uncertain and erroneous, leading Gen-NeRFs to produce blurry artifacts. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a novel Gen-NeRF framework called ID-NeRF that handles the uncertainty in sparse-view inputs by incorporating generative guidance. The key idea is to leverage a pre-trained diffusion model (PDM) to distill an imaginative latent space that refines the problematic reprojected features from Gen-NeRFs. Specifically:

1) They extract local features from input views via reprojection as usual Gen-NeRFs do. 

2) Separately, they infer a target-view specific latent space with a scene encoder. This latent space is distilled under the guidance of the PDM's predicted distribution to inject generative capacities.

3) The distilled latent vector is then used to refine the reprojected features via a self-attention mechanism before feeding into NeRF.

Such indirect supervision from the PDM prevents confusion for NeRF unlike direct regularization methods.

Main Contributions:
- Makes an early attempt to address the uncertainty issue in Gen-NeRFs by incorporating generative guidance.
- Proposes a novel ID-NeRF framework that leverages a distilled latent space for indirect guidance, avoiding model confusion.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, especially with sparse inputs.

The method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis results compared to previous Gen-NeRF works. It also generalizes better with fewer input views owing to the latent space's ability to fill in missing information.
