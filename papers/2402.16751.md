# [Value Preferences Estimation and Disambiguation in Hybrid Participatory   Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16751)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the challenge of estimating individuals' preferences over competing values (called "value preferences") in participatory systems where citizens make choices and provide textual motivations for those choices. Specifically, the paper focuses on situations where there are inconsistencies detected between a participant's choices and the motivations they provide in support of those choices. Resolving such inconsistencies can help improve the estimation of participants' value preferences.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a two-part method. First, five different methods are introduced to estimate value preferences from choices and motivations, prioritizing values extracted from motivations over values estimated from choices alone. This is based on the notion that "valuing is deliberatively consequential", so values explicitly mentioned in a motivation were the result of deliberation. The methods are evaluated in a case study on a large-scale survey on energy transition.

Second, a "disambiguation strategy" is proposed to address the detected inconsistencies between choices and motivations by interactively selecting participants and asking them to clarify whether the values extracted from their motivations are correct. This strategy selects participants whose value preferences estimated from choices alone differ the most from value preferences estimated from motivations alone. The intent is to rapidly improve value estimation for all participants by resolving issues for the most "informative" participants first.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes and compares five methods to estimate individual value preferences from both choices and motivations, showing that incorporating motivations significantly improves estimation accuracy.

- Introduces a novel disambiguation strategy to interactively address inconsistencies between choices and motivations, with the goal of improving value preference estimates. Evaluates this strategy in an active learning setting.

- Empirically demonstrates the feasibility of estimating value preferences and addressing inconsistencies in a hybrid system combining human and AI capabilities for participatory policymaking.

The paper makes both methodological and empirical contributions around improving value preference estimation through a hybrid approach of leveraging artificial and human intelligence.
