# [Evaluating Diverse Large Language Models for Automatic and General Bug   Reproduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04532)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph for the paper:

This paper presents LIBRO, a technique that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate bug-reproducing tests from natural language bug reports. The authors construct prompts from bug reports to guide the LLM to generate test method candidates. These candidates are injected into the project's test codebase, dependencies are resolved, and tests are executed to identify failing tests. Failing tests are further filtered and ranked based on agreement between test outputs and signals correlated with successful reproduction. Experiments using Codex showed LIBRO could reproduce 33\% of 750 real bugs in Defects4J and 32\% of 31 recent bugs, outperforming baselines. The paper also presents an extensive study comparing 15 LLMs, including open-source models, showing the potential of models like StarCoder. The selection algorithm works consistently across LLMs and larger models tend to perform better. The work demonstrates the promise of leveraging LLMs for automating test generation from bug reports while also providing useful guidelines on model selection and reproducibility concerns when building upon LLMs.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces LIBRO, a technique that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate bug reproducing tests from natural language bug reports. The authors construct prompts from bug reports to have the LLM generate candidate tests, then postprocess and execute the tests to identify promising ones. Experiments using the Codex LLM show LIBRO can reproduce 33% of bugs in the Defects4J benchmark. The authors also compare 15 different LLMs, finding open-source models like StarCoder can achieve 70% of Codex's performance. Evaluations on recent GitHub bugs not in training data confirm generalization. Analyses also reveal larger LLMs and proper temperature settings improve reproduction. Overall, the paper demonstrates LLMs can effectively generate tests from reports, and open-source models are a viable option. The extensive LLM comparison provides guidance on model selection and hyperparameters.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper evaluates the capability of different large language models, especially open-source ones, to automatically generate bug reproducing tests from natural language bug reports, and finds that techniques like StarCoder can reproduce a substantial portion of bugs while an appropriate pipeline can effectively filter and rank the results.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is: 

Can large language models (LLMs) be effectively used to automatically generate bug reproducing tests from bug reports?

The authors propose LIBRO, a technique that leverages LLMs to analyze bug reports and generate candidate bug reproducing tests. The paper then evaluates LIBRO extensively to determine its effectiveness at reproducing real bugs from the Defects4J benchmark and a dataset of recent bugs, as well as analyzing its efficiency. A key component of the research is comparing LIBRO's performance when using different LLMs, including proprietary models like Codex and open source options like StarCoder. The goal is to both demonstrate the viability of using LLMs for automated bug reproduction, and provide guidance on model selection based on factors like GPU memory constraints. The research questions specifically evaluate LIBRO's efficacy, efficiency, practicality, and sensitivity to the choice of underlying LLM.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing LIBRO, a technique that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate bug reproducing tests from natural language bug reports. 

2. Evaluating LIBRO with the Codex model from OpenAI on the Defects4J benchmark. LIBRO could reproduce 33.5% of 750 studied bugs, outperforming baselines like EvoCrash and a Copy & Paste approach.

3. Proposing a selection and ranking technique to reduce the number of tests developers need to inspect. This could filter out 33% of bugs while preserving 87% of successful reproductions.

4. Performing an extensive study comparing 15 LLMs on bug reproduction, including open-source models like StarCoder. This comparison reveals insights like:

- Open-source LLMs can achieve substantial performance, with StarCoder reproducing 70% as many bugs as Codex.

- Larger LLMs tend to achieve better reproduction performance. 

- The sampling temperature of 0.6 works best for LIBRO.

5. Demonstrating that LIBRO generalizes to new bugs likely outside of LLM training data. It could reproduce 32% of bugs in a dataset of recent issues.

6. Releasing LIBRO's code and experimental data to promote research.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing LIBRO, a novel technique to leverage LLMs for automated bug reproduction, extensively evaluating it, and releasing resources to facilitate future research. The comparisons across multiple LLMs are also an important contribution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research on using large language models (LLMs) for test generation:

- It provides the first large-scale evaluation and comparison of multiple LLMs (15 total) for automatic bug reproduction from bug reports, including many open-source LLMs. Prior work focused on evaluating 1-2 proprietary LLMs like Codex. 

- It proposes a full pipeline called LIBRO for generating and ranking bug reproducing tests from bug reports using LLMs. Other related works have focused only on test generation, not selection and ranking.

- Experiments are conducted on 750 real bugs from Defects4J and 31 recent bugs from GitHub (GHRB dataset). Many prior works evaluated on smaller or synthetic datasets.

- Quantitative metrics like bugs reproduced, precision, AUC, etc. are used to rigorously compare LLMs and pipeline components. Related works often lacked such detailed quantitative evaluation. 

- Analysis provides insights into how factors like LLM size, training data, prompt engineering, etc. impact performance. This helps guide practical LLM usage.

- Issues like model reproducibility, comparison to baselines, and potential threats like training data overlap are discussed. This provides a more comprehensive analysis than prior work.

Overall, the large-scale experiments, focus on reproducibility, and rigorous quantitative evaluation allow this work to provide unique insights compared to related research on leveraging LLMs for testing applications. The analysis and guidelines should be useful for both researchers and practitioners in this emerging field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my understanding, the authors suggest the following future research directions in the paper:

- Experimenting with generating an even greater number of tests per bug report, as the results in RQ2-1 suggest performance may continue improving.

- Constructing the execution environment of tests, such as creating required files, to expand the types of bugs that can be automatically reproduced. The example in Section 6.1 illustrates cases where this could help.

- Evaluating the capabilities of open-source LLMs on additional software engineering tasks beyond test generation, to promote their widespread adoption.

- Continuing research on understanding what factors influence LLM performance on software tasks, based on the model comparison results in RQ4.

- Leveraging the consistency of LLM outputs, as explored through the selection algorithm's robustness in RQ5, to diagnose potential issues when building services using LLMs.

In summary, the main future directions are: generating more tests, constructing execution environments, evaluating open-source LLMs further, analyzing what influences LLM performance, and using LLM output patterns as diagnostics.
