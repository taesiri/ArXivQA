## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework called MUG for multi-granularity representation learning of time series data. The framework integrates both fine-grained (timestamp-level) and coarse-grained (segment-level) representations to capture different levels of information. It employs a cross-granularity transformer with an attention mechanism to associate the coarse and fine-grained representations. For fine-grained fusion, an attention mechanism combines the timestamp embeddings into a comprehensive vector. For unsupervised training, a retrieval task with a custom loss function based on ranking similarity is used. Experiments on various time series datasets demonstrate that MUG outperforms both single-granularity baselines and other multi-granularity methods, especially on simulated real-world noisy data. The framework is flexibly adaptable to utilize different existing representation methods for both granularities. By effectively fusing multi-granularity information, MUG provides a more robust and comprehensive representation for time series analysis.
