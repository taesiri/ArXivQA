# [An Ordinal Regression Framework for a Deep Learning Based Severity   Assessment for Chest Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05685)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In clinical medicine, disease severity is often assessed on an ordinal scale rather than just binary presence/absence. However, most datasets for training deep learning models only provide binary labels. 
- Existing chest X-ray datasets lack nuanced severity grades and mainly indicate disease presence or absence. 
- Goal is to develop an ordinal regression framework to categorize disease severity from chest radiographs into multiple ordered levels.

Methods:
- Propose a modular ordinal regression framework with 3 components: 
   1) Model (CNN or transformer) 
   2) Target function that defines output vector for each severity class during training
   3) Classification function that maps model output to severity classes
- Investigate different target functions: one-hot encoding, Gaussian encoding, continuous encoding, progress bar, soft progress bar, binary encoding
- Use weighted Cohen's kappa to evaluate methods, penalizing larger deviations from ground truth more
- Train ResNet50 and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on dataset of 193K labeled chest X-rays 

Results:
- One-hot encoding works best for exact class match (unweighted kappa)
- For weighted kappa, Gaussian, progress-bar and soft-progress bar encodings perform best 
- Encoding method impacts performance more significantly than model architecture
- Different methods excel depending on choice of deviation-weighting in kappa

Conclusions:
- No single optimal ordinal regression method, choice depends on application priorities
- Framework allows efficient implementation and comparison of encoding strategies
- Weighted kappa better reflects disease severity assessment priorities than binary classification
- Encoding method's impact on performance underscores need for careful selection based on clinical relevance of deviations

Contributions:
- Unified modular framework to accommodate and evaluate ordinal regression techniques 
- Introduction of soft progress bar method optimized for minimizing large deviations
- First systematic evaluation of encoding strategies for ordinal severity regression from chest X-rays
- Analysis of performance weighting clinical relevance of deviations via weighted Cohen's kappa
