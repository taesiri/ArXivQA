# [Towards Trustworthy Reranking: A Simple yet Effective Abstention   Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12997)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural retrieval systems still frequently fail to retrieve relevant documents for a user's query, which can have negative consequences especially in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.  
- Lack of significant work on developing abstention mechanisms for neural information retrieval (NIR) systems, especially given real-world constraints like black-box access to relevance scores.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a lightweight abstention mechanism for neural reranking models to detect unreliable predictions and abstain from providing results.
- Focus on the reranking stage which plays a key role in shaping IR system performance.
- Constraints: black-box access to relevance scores, low computational overhead, configurable abstention rate.  
- Evaluate both reference-free heuristics (e.g. max score) and simple but effective reference-based methods (e.g. learned linear combination) requiring only a small labeled dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Devise protocol to evaluate abstention methods for reranking in a black-box setting.
- Propose simple yet effective data-driven abstention method outperforming reference-free baselines.
- Analyze method via ablations on abstention effectiveness, threshold calibration, domain adaptation, etc.
- Release code package and artifacts to enable implementation of abstention for any reranking model/system.
- Highlight potential of abstention for building more reliable and trustworthy NIR systems.

In summary, the paper develops a practical abstention approach to detect unreliable neural reranking predictions to enhance NIR system accuracy and trustworthiness. A simple yet effective data-driven method is proposed and analyzed across various axes to demonstrate its relevance.
