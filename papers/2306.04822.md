# [Optimizing ViViT Training: Time and Memory Reduction for Action   Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04822)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we reduce the substantial training time and memory consumption associated with video transformers, specifically the factorised encoder variant of the ViViT model, in order to make them more accessible for researchers and practitioners with limited resources?The key hypothesis seems to be:By freezing the spatial transformer and adding a lightweight adapter module during fine-tuning, along with properly initializing the temporal transformer, it is possible to significantly cut down on training costs and memory usage of the ViViT model without sacrificing accuracy or model sophistication.In summary, the paper aims to investigate strategies to optimize ViViT training to address the challenges posed by the model's demanding computational requirements, with the goal of enabling broader access and application of advanced video transformers. The proposed methods focus on harnessing the sophistication of ViViT while minimizing its resource demands.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents a method to optimize the training of the ViViT model, a video transformer model, for action recognition. The key contributions are:- It proposes a two-stage training strategy to reduce training time and memory requirements of ViViT while maintaining accuracy. - In stage 1, it pretrains a low-frame version of ViViT (e.g. 8 frames) to initialize the model. This serves to initialize both the spatial and temporal transformers.- In stage 2, it fine-tunes the model on more frames (e.g. 32-128 frames) while freezing the spatial transformer and adding a lightweight adapter module. This allows end-to-end training to focus on the temporal transformer. - It shows this approach can reduce training time by ~50% and memory usage while achieving comparable or slightly better accuracy than baseline ViViT training.- It demonstrates the capability to handle more input frames (up to 80) on typical GPUs with this method.- It also shows the ability to incorporate larger backbone vision transformers (e.g. ViT-G) in the spatial transformer, enabled by the memory savings.In summary, the key contribution is a training recipe that makes training video transformers like ViViT significantly more efficient in terms of speed and memory, opening up access to larger models and input videos. This could help democratize training of advanced video models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes an efficient training strategy for video transformers that uses an adapter module and initialization with a low-frame model to reduce training time and memory usage while maintaining accuracy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research in efficient video action recognition:- It focuses specifically on reducing the training time and memory requirements of the ViViT model. Other work like TokenLearner, STTS, and TokShift aim to reduce FLOPs and parameters. - The two main strategies proposed - using a compact adapter module and initializing the temporal transformer - are novel compared to prior work. Most past work looks at model architecture changes or token/feature selection.- It demonstrates both reduced training time (around 50% savings) and competitive or slightly improved accuracy. Other methods like STTS also reduce cost but usually with an accuracy trade-off.- It enables the use of larger backbone models like ViT-g by freezing the spatial transformer. Other methods maintain similar backbone sizes as standard ViViT.- The work highlights the problem of limited computational resources in academia/research. Most past efficient video recognition research doesn't discuss this motivation.- The curriculum learning-based training approach is unique. Prior work doesn't train first on cheaper subsets before fine-tuning.Overall, this paper makes meaningful contributions over past work by adapting ViViT specifically to reduce training time on limited resources. The proposed training strategies and insights around spatial vs. temporal transformer initialization appear novel and lead to tangible improvements over baseline ViViT.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my review of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring how their proposed training strategy could be adapted and applied to other video transformer architectures besides ViViT. The authors focus their experiments on ViViT but suggest their approach could potentially benefit other models as well.- Investigating further optimizations and refinements of their two-stage training strategy and adapter model approach. The authors propose this as an effective technique but suggest there may be opportunities to refine it further. - Applying their efficient training method to additional computer vision tasks beyond action recognition, such as video segmentation, video object detection etc. The authors indicate their approach could have broader applicability.- Developing more universal models that could work well across multiple datasets without needing dataset-specific training. The authors note this could further improve efficiency.- Adapting their approach for integrated space-time transformers, as their method currently relies on separate spatial/temporal encoders like ViViT's factorized encoder design.- Continued exploration of strategies to reduce training costs and memory requirements for video transformers. The authors position their work as an advance on this wider research direction.In summary, the main suggestions are to refine and extend their training approach to other models, tasks, and datasets, with the overarching goal of enabling more efficient and scalable video transformer training. Making these models more accessible is highlighted as an important aim for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes strategies to reduce the training time and memory consumption of video transformers, specifically focusing on the ViViT model. The authors utilize a two-stage approach, first pretraining a cheap 8-frame version of ViViT to initialize the full model. In the second stage, they freeze the spatial transformer backbone and add a lightweight adapter module to finetune the spatial features. They show this allows cutting the training cost nearly in half while maintaining accuracy. Key to their approach is properly initializing the temporal transformer, often overlooked in prior work. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate their method matches or outperforms standard ViViT training in accuracy with 50% less cost. The work provides valuable insights to train advanced video transformers with limited resources.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a method for optimizing the training of the ViViT model, a video vision transformer, for action recognition tasks. The ViViT model consists of a spatial transformer that extracts features from individual frames and a temporal transformer that processes temporal information across frames. Training video transformers like ViViT is computationally expensive due to the complexity of modeling spatiotemporal features. To address this, the authors propose two strategies: (1) using a compact adapter model to fine-tune the spatial transformer instead of end-to-end training, which reduces computation and memory usage, and (2) initializing the temporal transformer using a baseline ViViT model trained on just 8 frames, rather than random initialization. This proper initialization is shown to be critical for maintaining accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that this optimized training approach reduces training costs by 50% and memory consumption while achieving similar or slightly better performance compared to normal ViViT training. It also enables the use of larger transformer models and more input frames. Overall, this method makes training video transformers more accessible, especially for researchers with limited computational resources.
