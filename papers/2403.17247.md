# [DASA: Delay-Adaptive Multi-Agent Stochastic Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper considers a distributed stochastic approximation (SA) setting with N agents that communicate with a central server to cooperatively solve an optimization problem. The agents' update directions to the server are subject to asynchronous and potentially unbounded time-varying delays. Existing algorithms either converge slowly due to dependence on the maximum delay or do not achieve speedup guarantees under correlated sampling. The goal is to design an algorithm that mitigates the impact of delays and achieves an N-fold convergence speedup under Markovian sampling.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes \texttt{DASA}, a Delay-Adaptive algorithm for multi-agent SA. The key ideas are:

1) Use only the freshest update directions: At each iteration, use the directions from the N/2 agents with the smallest delay errors. This controls the staleness of information. 

2) Adaptive error thresholding: Directions are used only if the median delay error is below a threshold ε that ensures sufficient freshness. This prevents using very stale gradients.

3) Averaging for variance reduction: Average the N/2 freshest directions to reduce noise.

Main Contributions:

1) Convergence rate independent of maximum delay: The convergence rate of \texttt{DASA} depends only on the average network delay τ_{avg}, not the maximum delay.

2) N-fold linear speedup under Markovian sampling: Despite delays and correlated sampling, \texttt{DASA} achieves a linear convergence speedup with number of agents N. Prior works either had no speedup guarantees or required i.i.d. sampling.

3) First algorithm to jointly achieve (1) and (2).

4) Finite-time analysis quantifying the convergence rate and speedup.

5) Experiments on distributed TD learning validating the superior performance over non-adaptive methods.

In summary, the key novelty is the design and analysis of the first algorithm for distributed SA that mitigates arbitrary delays and achieves collaborative speedups under Markovian sampling. The paper makes fundamental progress on distributed SA with non-i.i.d. data.
