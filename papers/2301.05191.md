# [Event-Based Frame Interpolation with Ad-hoc Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05191)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that the tasks of event-based sharp frame interpolation (VFI) and blurry frame interpolation can be unified in a single framework. 

The key ideas are:

- Previous event-based VFI methods assume the input frames are sharp. However, motion blur is inevitable in real videos. 

- Previous methods treat sharp and blurry VFI as separate tasks. The authors argue they can be addressed jointly using events.

- They propose a recurrent network named REFID that performs interpolation and deblurring in an ad-hoc manner based on a bidirectional architecture and novel attention fusion.

- REFID works for both sharp and blurry input frames thanks to the events providing high-speed intensity changes unaffected by blur.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that a single model can perform high-quality interpolation for both sharp and blurry frames by leveraging event information. This is verified through experiments showing REFID outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on both tasks.
