# [Event-Based Frame Interpolation with Ad-hoc Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05191)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that the tasks of event-based sharp frame interpolation (VFI) and blurry frame interpolation can be unified in a single framework. 

The key ideas are:

- Previous event-based VFI methods assume the input frames are sharp. However, motion blur is inevitable in real videos. 

- Previous methods treat sharp and blurry VFI as separate tasks. The authors argue they can be addressed jointly using events.

- They propose a recurrent network named REFID that performs interpolation and deblurring in an ad-hoc manner based on a bidirectional architecture and novel attention fusion.

- REFID works for both sharp and blurry input frames thanks to the events providing high-speed intensity changes unaffected by blur.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that a single model can perform high-quality interpolation for both sharp and blurry frames by leveraging event information. This is verified through experiments showing REFID outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on both tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a unified framework and novel network architecture for event-based frame interpolation that can handle both sharp and blurry input videos. The key highlights are:

- It introduces a recurrent network architecture called REFID that can perform event-based interpolation for sharp frames, blurry frames, and joint interpolation and deblurring in a unified manner. The network uses bidirectional event recurrent blocks and an attention-based fusion module.

- It is based on the underlying physical model of high frame-rate video formation and event generation, taking into account the exposure time of frames. This allows it to handle blurry frames robustly.

- It achieves state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks like GoPro for tasks like sharp interpolation, blurry interpolation, and single image deblurring.

- It presents a new high-resolution event-RGB dataset called HighREV for evaluating real-world performance.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a principled and unified network architecture for various interpolation and deblurring tasks by leveraging events, along with extensive experiments showing its effectiveness. The unified handling of sharp and blurry frames is a key novelty compared to prior arts.
