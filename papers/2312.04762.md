# [The Graph Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Informative Graph   Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04762)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) Hypothesis, which postulates that every graph contains an extremely sparse subset of edges that can match the full graph's utility for graph learning tasks if models are trained on only that subset. The authors systematically study key metrics like algebraic connectivity, effective resistance, and triangle count that influence graph learning algorithm performance. They then define GLTs as winning tickets - sparse subgraphs that robustly approximate the full graph's capabilities. The paper proposes efficient algorithms for finding GLTs in arbitrary graphs by taking unions of random spanning trees. Empirically, GLTs enable comparable performance to the full graph for algorithms like graph clustering, embedding, and Graph Neural Networks, even at very low average degrees of 5 edges per node. Overall, the paper provides strong evidence for the existence of highly informative sparse backbones within graph data. The proposed tree-based GLT search methods scale linearly and outperform spectral and edge significance baselines across diverse metrics and datasets.
