# [Referring Image Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05149)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How to perform controllable image matting to extract a specific foreground object indicated by a natural language description? 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new task called Referring Image Matting (RIM) to extract the meticulous alpha matte of a particular foreground object described by a natural language expression. 

- This is different from conventional image matting methods which either require auxiliary inputs like trimaps/scribbles or extract all foregrounds indiscriminately. 

- RIM aims to enable more flexible and natural control of image matting through language descriptions.

- To facilitate research on RIM, the paper introduces a large-scale dataset RefMatte with diverse images and expressions.

- It also proposes a novel baseline method CLIPMat specifically designed for the RIM task, which utilizes CLIP and matting decoders.

- Experiments validate the effectiveness of CLIPMat and the value of RefMatte for the new RIM task.

In summary, the key research question is how to perform controllable image matting on a specific object indicated by a natural language description, for which the paper proposes the new RIM task, RefMatte dataset, and CLIPMat method.
