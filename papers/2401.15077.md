# [EAGLE: Speculative Sampling Requires Rethinking Feature Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15077)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are very slow during inference due to their auto-regressive decoding process which generates one token at a time. This makes their widespread deployment challenging. 

- Speculative sampling methods like Leviathan can accelerate decoding by first quickly generating a draft sequence in parallel then validating it against the original LLM. However, finding a suitable low-latency draft model remains difficult.

Method: 
- The paper proposes EAGLE, a simple yet efficient speculative sampling framework. 

- EAGLE performs auto-regression at the feature level instead of token level, using the second-top layer features of the LLM. This is more stable over time compared to raw tokens.

- To address uncertainty in next feature prediction during auto-regression, EAGLE also feeds in the sampled tokens from one timestep ahead. This greatly improves draft accuracy.

- The draft model is very lightweight, only consisting of a transformer decoder layer trained with a simple reconstruction loss.

Main Contributions:
- EAGLE provides over 3x speedup on LLaMA and Vicuna models on dialogue tasks, outperforming recent methods like Medusa and Lookahead.

- It has very low training costs compared to methods that train separate draft models, and theoretically guarantees no change in output distribution.

- EAGLE is simple to implement as a plug-in, maintains reliability in edge cases, and is compatible with other optimization methods like model quantization.

In summary, EAGLE introduces an efficient way to accelerate LLMs for no-risk speed gains using feature-level speculative sampling with uncertainty modeling. The simplicity and reliability of the approach are its main strengths.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes EAGLE, a simple yet efficient framework for accelerating large language model decoding through auto-regressing at the feature level and addressing next-feature prediction uncertainty by incorporating tokens from one time step ahead.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing EAGLE, a simple yet efficient framework for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) using speculative sampling. The key ideas and advantages of EAGLE include:

1) It performs the drafting process auto-regressively at the feature level instead of the token level, which is more regular and easier to model. This results in higher quality drafts.

2) It addresses the uncertainty in next-feature prediction by incorporating tokens from one time step ahead into the draft model input. This significantly improves draft accuracy. 

3) It achieves state-of-the-art acceleration results while provably preserving the output distribution of the original LLM. On benchmark datasets, it demonstrates 1.5-3x speedups over vanilla decoding and outpaces prior speculative sampling methods.

4) The framework only requires adding a lightweight transformer decoder layer to the LLM, making it simple to deploy. The training overhead is also low.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a fast yet reliable speculative sampling framework that accelerates LLM inference through innovations in effectively modeling the feature space while addressing sampling uncertainty.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the EAGLE method proposed in this paper:

1. EAGLE performs auto-regression at the feature level rather than the token level. What motivated this design choice? How does operating at the feature level help address some of the challenges with token-level auto-regression?

2. The paper mentions that incorporating the sampled tokens into the input of the draft model helps address uncertainty in the auto-regressive feature predictions. Can you elaborate more on where this uncertainty comes from and how having the sampled tokens available helps mitigate it? 

3. The draft model in EAGLE is relatively simple, consisting mainly of a transformer decoder layer. Why is such a simple model sufficient for generating high-quality draft sequences in EAGLE? What properties of operating at the feature level enable this?

4. EAGLE utilizes tree-structured attention during draft generation rather than simpler chain-based generation. What are the tradeoffs associated with tree versus chain generation and how does this impact metrics like acceptance rate and speedup?

5. The paper shows combining EAGLE with other acceleration methods like gpt-fast. What types of acceleration methods could EAGLE potentially be combined with and what challenges need to be addressed when integrating speculative sampling with other approaches?

6. One advantage highlighted is that EAGLE allows accelerating models in a zero-shot manner without fine-tuning. Why is the lack of fine-tuning important? Are there ways to further improve EAGLE performance with some light fine-tuning while preserving output distribution integrity?

7. EAGLE appears less effective at accelerating Mixture-of-Experts models compared to decoder-only models. What causes this difference and how might EAGLE be adapted to work better for MoE models?

8. The paper utilizes a fixed training set claiming low sensitivity to the training data. But could further gains be achieved with a more robust and diverse training set? What properties would an ideal training set have?

9. Error analysis showed that inaccuracies in the auto-regressive feature predictions can accumulate over long sequences. Are there ways to detect or mitigate this accumulation effect to improve very long text generation?

10. Beyond the models tested, what other large language model architectures could EAGLE be applied to accelerate in future work? Would adaptations be needed to work with sparse models, 2D architectures etc.?
