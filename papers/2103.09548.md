# [ENCONTER: Entity Constrained Progressive Sequence Generation via   Insertion-based Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09548)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question addressed is: 

How to develop an insertion-based transformer model that can efficiently generate text sequences with hard lexical constraints, specifically entity constraints?

The key points are:

- Existing insertion-based transformers like Pointer do not handle entity constraints well. A naive adaption like Pointer-E suffers from "cold start problem" where generation fails in early stages.

- The paper proposes two new models - Greedy Enconter and BBT-Enconter - that use bottom-up masking and balanced binary tree reward to address the cold start issue and inefficiency.

- Experiments show Enconter models achieve higher recall, quality, lower failure rate and efficiency compared to Pointer-E and GPT-2 baselines on constrained text generation tasks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that a bottom-up insertion approach with binary tree rewards can enable transformers to efficiently generate high quality text under hard entity constraints. The Enconter models are proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing two new insertion transformer models, Enconter and BBT-Enconter, to address the challenges of enforcing hard entity constraints in text generation. Specifically:

- The paper analyzes existing insertion transformer models like Pointer and identifies issues with enforcing entity constraints, such as the cold start problem where models fail to generate meaningful tokens early on. 

- To address this, Enconter uses a bottom-up masking strategy during training to encourage generating more meaningful tokens early in the process. 

- BBT-Enconter further incorporates a balanced binary tree reward scheme to improve efficiency by reducing the number of insertion steps required.

- Experiments on real-world datasets show Enconter and BBT-Enconter outperform baselines like Pointer-E and GPT-2 in metrics like recall, quality, and failure rate while maintaining efficiency.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing two new insertion transformer models designed specifically to handle hard entity constraints in text generation through modifications like bottom-up masking and balanced binary tree rewards. Experiments validate these models outperform prior approaches on key metrics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two new insertion transformer models, Enconter and BBT-Enconter, that use a bottom-up training strategy to enable hard lexical constraints like entities during text generation while avoiding premature termination issues faced by prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in constrained text generation:

- This paper focuses specifically on hard lexical constraints involving entities that must be included in the generated text. Many existing methods for constrained text generation handle soft constraints or template-based constraints, but enforcing hard entity constraints is less explored.

- The paper analyzes limitations of prior insertion transformer models like Pointer for handling entity constraints, identifying issues like the cold start problem. The proposed Enconter models aim to address these limitations.

- Enconter introduces a bottom-up masking strategy for training the insertion transformer, compared to the top-down masking of Pointer. This is shown to reduce failure rates and the cold start problem when generating with entity constraints.

- Efficiency is considered through the balanced binary tree scheme in BBT-Enconter. This allows generating with fewer steps compared to the greedy Enconter, getting closer to Pointer's efficiency.

- The paper evaluates on diverse real-world datasets - news, job descriptions, etc. Many existing approaches are only evaluated on news or Wikipedia data. The entity constraints are also derived from true entities in the datasets.

- Overall, Enconter demonstrates improved performance over strong baselines like Pointer and GPT-2 for hard constrained generation with entities. The innovations like bottom-up masking and binary tree insertion seem effective.

In summary, the paper advances constrained text generation by addressing limitations of prior insertion transformer approaches for the important problem of hard entity constraints. The empirical evaluations on real-world data help demonstrate these improvements.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Considering more diverse constraints beyond just hard entity constraints, such as soft constraints, rules, etc. This could expand the applicability of the models to more real-world applications. 

- Incorporating user interaction into the generation process. Allowing some user guidance during generation could help improve results in cases where the model struggles to generate high quality text that meets the constraints.

- Expanding the evaluation to include human judgments beyond just automatic metrics. Human evaluation could give a better sense of the true quality and usefulness of the constrained text.

- Exploring how these insertion transformer models could be applied to other conditional generation tasks like summarization, data-to-text generation, etc. The techniques could potentially improve performance in other NLG applications.

- Comparing to a wider range of baseline models like non-monotonic sequence generation methods. This could give a more comprehensive view of how the proposed models compare.

- Analyzing the training data and model outputs more deeply using techniques like attention visualization. This could provide insight into how well the models are learning to focus on the constraint tokens.

- Experimenting with different model architectures and training techniques to further improve efficiency and generation quality. There is still room to optimize the models.

In summary, the authors propose several promising avenues such as incorporating more diverse constraints, user interaction, and expanding to other text generation applications as directions for future work based on their insertion transformer models for hard constrained text generation. More comprehensive evaluation and model analysis are also suggested as areas for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes two new insertion transformer models called Enconter and BBT-Enconter for constrained text generation with hard lexical constraints. The key idea is to use a bottom-up preprocessing strategy to prepare the training data, which helps eliminate the cold start problem suffered by prior insertion transformer models like Pointer-E that use top-down masking. Enconter greedily selects the most important token in each span to mask during training, while BBT-Enconter incorporates a balanced binary tree reward to bias selection of tokens nearer the center of the span. Experiments on news and job post datasets show Enconter and BBT-Enconter achieve higher recall and quality compared to Pointer-E and GPT-2 baselines, while avoiding cold start failures and maintaining efficiency. The models are designed to support hard entity constraints for text generation which is useful for many real-world applications.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new insertion-based transformer model called Enconter for hard constrained text generation. Enconter is designed to address limitations in prior insertion-based models like Pointer when generating text conditioned on entities. The key problems with Pointer are that it suffers from cold start issues during inference when conditioned on unevenly distributed entities, and it cannot properly enforce multi-token entity constraints. 

To address these issues, Enconter incorporates two main ideas. First, it uses a bottom-up masking strategy during training to encourage generation of more meaningful tokens early on. Second, it allows for entity span aware inference to prevent splitting of multi-token entities. Experiments on news and job description datasets show Enconter overcomes cold start problems, achieves higher recall of entities, generates more fluent and diverse text, and performs more efficient generation compared to Pointer and autoregressive baselines. Overall, Enconter demonstrates stronger capabilities for conditioned text generation under hard lexical constraints.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes two new insertion transformer models called Enconter and BBT-Enconter for hard entity constrained text generation. Enconter models use a bottom-up masking strategy during training to insert important context tokens between entity tokens in each training iteration. This helps address the cold start problem faced by prior top-down masking models like Pointer-E that fail to generate meaningful tokens in early inference steps. Enconter greedily selects the most important token to insert based on importance scores. BBT-Enconter further incorporates a balanced binary tree reward scheme to bias selection of tokens near the center, thereby improving efficiency. Both models are designed to be entity aware during training and inference, ensuring recall of input entity constraints. Experiments on news and job description datasets demonstrate Enconter models outperform Pointer-E and GPT-2 baselines by achieving higher entity recall without cold start failures, better generation quality and diversity, while maintaining efficiency.
