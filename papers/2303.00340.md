# [A Practical Upper Bound for the Worst-Case Attribution Deviations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

1) How does an inhomogeneous stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo respond to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies? In particular, what is the resulting phase-space structure and evolution of the response? 

2) How do phase-space spirals or "snails" form in the vertical phase-space of disk stars following a perturbation? How do their structure and evolution depend on the nature of the perturbation and properties of the disk and halo?

3) Can the observed phase-space spirals in the Milky Way disk provide constraints on the past history of perturbations to the Galaxy as well as the gravitational potential of the disk and halo?

The authors develop a theoretical framework to analyze the linear response of a collisionless stellar disk to general perturbations. They apply this to compute the disk response and resulting phase-space spirals for different perturbations like bars, spiral arms, and satellite encounters. A key goal is to understand if and how phase-space spirals can be used to uncover the perturbation history and gravitational potential of galaxies like the Milky Way.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and satellite galaxy impacts. The key points are:

- It computes the linear response of a realistic stellar disk, characterized by a pseudo-isothermal distribution function and embedded in a dark matter halo, to general perturbations. 

- Without self-gravity to reinforce it, the response phase mixes away due to the intrinsic spread in stellar oscillation frequencies, giving rise to phase-space spirals. 

- Collisional diffusion damps the response and phase spirals on a timescale of 0.6-0.7 Gyr in the Solar neighborhood.

- Transient, rapidly varying bars/spirals are needed to trigger vertical phase-spirals. Persistent patterns with fixed pattern speeds drive coherent oscillations rather than phase mixing.

- Slower satellite flybys excite predominantly bending modes while faster ones trigger breathing modes. Among MW satellites, Sagittarius triggers the strongest response and is the leading culprit if the Gaia snail was caused by a satellite.

- The presence of a dark matter halo leads to slower phase mixing and more loosely wound phase-spirals compared to a disk-only case.

In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive theoretical framework to model the formation and evolution of phase-spirals in response to perturbations, with implications for galactic dynamics and galaxy potential constraints. The key contribution is a detailed perturbative analysis applied to a realistic galactic disk system.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper develops a theoretical framework to model the response of a galactic disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations like transient spiral arms, bars, or encounters with satellite galaxies, with a focus on analyzing the resulting phase-space spirals and their dependence on the perturbation timescale and galactic potential.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on phase spirals and disk dynamics:

- This paper builds on the previous work by the same authors (Banik et al. 2022, referred to as Paper I) to develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework for modeling phase spirals in galactic disks. It improves upon the simple isothermal slab model used in Paper I by considering a more realistic disk model and including the effects of a dark matter halo. 

- Compared to other theoretical studies, this paper provides a more general treatment of how different types of perturbations (bars, spirals, satellite interactions) can excite phase spirals in disks. It derives analytical expressions for the response that provide physical insight into how the timescale and symmetry of the perturbation impacts the bending vs breathing modes.

- In terms of comparing to simulations, this paper complements recent N-body studies focused specifically on the interaction between the Milky Way and Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (e.g. Hunt et al. 2021). The analytical framework here allows exploring a wider range of encounter parameters. The results on bending vs breathing modes are qualitatively consistent with the simulations. 

- Observationally, this paper does not analyze new data, but provides interpretation of existing results, especially Antoja et al. (2018) discovery of the snail shell phase spiral in Gaia data. It supports the idea that this spiral could have been triggered by Sagittarius, but suggests the timing needs to be more recent than sometimes assumed.

- Overall, this paper makes an important theoretical contribution by developing more sophisticated analytical models for phase spirals in galactic disks. It demonstrates these models by providing insights into the vertical oscillations and spiral structure of the Milky Way disk. This framework can serve as a foundation for future studies to make further links between theory and observations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Including the effects of self-gravity of the disk response to perturbations. The authors note that self-gravity can enhance the amplitude of phase-spirals and cause coherent oscillations of the disk as a whole. However, a more detailed theoretical description of the self-gravitating response of realistic, inhomogeneous disks is needed.

- Accounting for the indirect response of the disk due to perturbations in the dark matter halo triggered by events like satellite encounters. The authors suggest this halo response could be comparable to the direct disk response and merits further analysis. 

- Using phase-spirals to constrain the total galactic potential. The authors propose the detailed shape of phase-spirals can constrain the disk+halo potential if triggered by a single, impulsive perturbation. But they note this technique needs further development to account for cases with overlapping perturbations.

- Including dynamical friction in estimating the disk response to satellite encounters. The orbit evolution of satellites due to dynamical friction can affect disk crossing times and responses.

- Exploring triggers for the two-armed phase-spiral in the inner Milky Way disk. The authors suggest this breathing mode feature is unexpected and its origin is unclear. Further work is needed to examine if realistic bar/spiral arm perturbations could cause it.

- Studying the self-gravitating response of disks to general perturbations beyond bars, such as spiral arms and satellite encounters. A more generic theoretical framework is needed.

In summary, the authors highlight the need to expand the theoretical framework developed here to include additional physical effects like self-gravity and halo perturbations. They also suggest follow-up work to apply phase-spirals to constrain galactic potentials and understand the origins of observed phase-spiral features.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and satellite galaxy encounters. It computes the resulting phase-space spirals or "snails" from the phase-mixing of the disk response. The shape and survival of these snails against collisional damping provides information on the perturbation history and gravitational potential. The analysis shows that transient, rapidly evolving bars/spirals are needed to create vertical snails, while slow satellite flybys mainly trigger in-plane responses. Sagittarius is likely the main satellite contributor to the Solar neighborhood snail, requiring an impact 0.6-0.7 Gyr ago to survive damping. Overall, this theoretical treatment elucidates how phase-space spirals can be used to uncover the disk's dynamical history and galactic potential.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies. It focuses on the vertical oscillations and phase mixing of stars that give rise to phase-space spirals or "snails" observed in Gaia data. The authors model the unperturbed galaxy as a rotating disk with an exponential radial profile, isothermal vertical structure, and embedded in a dark matter halo. They apply linear perturbation theory to derive the first-order response of the disk distribution function to a time-dependent perturbing potential. 

Without self-gravity to reinforce the response, it phase mixes away due to the spread in vertical, radial, and azimuthal frequencies of stars, giving rise to local phase-space spirals. The paper computes the disk response and resulting phase-spirals for transient and persistent bars/spirals as well as satellite encounters. It finds that the spiral's coarse-grained amplitude damps as 1/t in a realistic disk versus a steeper Gaussian decay in an idealized slab. Collisional diffusion damps the fine-grained amplitude faster in the inner disk and for stars with lower vertical actions. The paper concludes by discussing how the shape of phase-spirals constrains the galactic potential and by summarizing the key results.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper develops a linear perturbative formalism to compute the response of an inhomogeneous stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies. The key aspects are:

- The dynamics of stars are modeled using action-angle variables. Each star oscillates with three fundamental frequencies - vertical ($\Omega_z$), radial ($\Omega_r$), and azimuthal ($\Omega_\phi$). 

- The disk response consists of oscillations at combinations of these three frequencies. Different modes like bending, breathing, etc. correspond to different frequency combinations. 

- Without self-gravity to reinforce it, the disk response phase mixes away over time due to the spread in oscillation frequencies of stars, giving rise to phase-space spirals. 

- Collisional diffusion due to scattering against giant molecular clouds causes damping of the phase-spiral amplitude over time.  

- The potential of the disk+halo system dictates how the frequencies depend on the actions, which impacts the rate of phase mixing and shape of phase-spirals. This can be used to constrain the galactic potential.

In summary, the paper develops a detailed perturbative framework using action-angle variables to study the formation, evolution and damping of phase-spirals in response to different perturbations, and demonstrates how phase-spirals can be used to unravel the perturbation history and galactic potential.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk to perturbations such as bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies. The key question it addresses is: how do such perturbations induce phase-space structures known as "phase-spirals" in the disk stars, and what do the properties of these phase-spirals reveal about the perturbing agent and the gravitational potential of the galaxy?

Some key aspects of the analysis:

- It considers a realistic galactic disk with a distribution function (DF) that captures the orbital dynamics and frequencies of disk stars. 

- It embeds the disk in a non-responsive dark matter halo, which modifies the disk potential and frequencies.

- It applies linear perturbation theory to compute the response of the DF to general perturbations.

- Without self-gravity to reinforce it, the response phase-mixes away due to a spread in stellar frequencies, giving rise to phase-spirals. 

- It models the damping of phase-spirals due to collisional diffusion (scattering by giant molecular clouds etc).

- It computes the disk response and resulting phase-spirals for perturbations like bars, spiral arms, and satellite encounters.

- It shows the shape and survival of phase-spirals depends on the perturbing agent, time since perturbation, and the galactic potential.

In summary, the paper develops a comprehensive theoretical framework to model the formation and properties of phase-spirals in response to perturbations, in order to constrain the origin and history of observed phase-spirals like the Gaia snail.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a galactic disk embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations like bars, spiral arms, and encounters with satellite galaxies. Using linear perturbation theory, the authors compute the perturbed distribution function of disk stars and show that the response phase mixes and spawns phase-spirals in phase-space due to the spread in stellar oscillation frequencies. Transient, impulsive perturbations like passing satellites predominantly excite bending modes and one-armed spirals while slow, adiabatic perturbations trigger breathing modes and two-armed spirals. The winding rate and shape of phase-spirals depends on the disk+halo potential and can thus constrain it. Collisional diffusion due to GMCs damps phase-spirals over 0.6-0.7 Gyr at the Solar circle. Amongst MW satellites, the authors find Sagittarius to be the leading trigger of the Gaia phase-spiral. The framework developed provides key insights into the dynamical response and modes of a perturbed galactic disk and the dependence on the perturbation agent and timescale.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze phase-spirals in galactic disks perturbed by bars, spiral arms, or satellite encounters. It shows how phase-spirals encode information about the perturbation history and gravitational potential of the disk.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points made in this paper:

This paper develops a theoretical framework to analyze the response of a realistic disk galaxy embedded in a dark matter halo to perturbations like bars, spiral arms, and satellite encounters. It shows that without self-gravity to reinforce it, the response phase mixes and creates phase-spirals due to the spread in stellar oscillation frequencies. Collisional diffusion due to scattering of stars damps the spirals super-exponentially over 0.6-0.7 Gyr timescale. Transient perturbations with timescales comparable to vertical oscillation periods induce the strongest response and trigger either one-armed (bending mode) or two-armed (breathing mode) spirals depending on symmetry of perturbation about disk midplane. Persistent patterns rotating at fixed speeds cannot induce phase-spirals. Encounters with satellites like Sagittarius generally trigger bending modes and hence one-armed spirals in the solar neighborhood. The rate of phase-mixing and shape of the spiral depends on the disk+halo potential. So if triggered by a single, impulsive perturbation, phase-spirals can potentially be used to constrain the gravitational potential.

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we quantitatively bound the worst-case deviation in model attributions when inputs are perturbed within a certain region while maintaining the original classification output?

The key points are:

- The paper aims to derive theoretical upper bounds on the maximum difference in model attributions when inputs are perturbed, but classification outputs remain unchanged. 

- This provides a measure of the robustness of model attributions against perturbations. Smaller upper bounds indicate more robust attributions.

- The attributions considered are for gradient-based methods like integrated gradients, which are widely used for model interpretability.

- The perturbations are constrained to be small in either L2 or Linfinity norm so that inputs remain visually similar. 

- Upper bounds are derived both with and without constraining the classification output to remain unchanged. The bounds with label constraints are tighter.

- The theoretical bounds are validated on image datasets like CIFAR-10 against perturbation methods like PGD attacks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that tight theoretical upper bounds can be derived on attribution deviations under input perturbations, providing a robustness measure for model interpretations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution deviations after images are perturbed while the classification results remain unchanged. Specifically:

- The paper formulates a constrained optimization problem to find the maximum change of attributions under certain norm constraints on the perturbation and label constraint. This provides a general framework to quantify attribution robustness.

- For Euclidean distance and cosine distance metrics, tight upper bounds are derived for $\ell_2$ norm bounded perturbations, with and without label constraints. 

- For more challenging $\ell_\infty$ norm bounded perturbations, the paper provides two practical approaches to estimate the upper bounds.

- The proposed bounds are evaluated on different datasets, models and attack methods. Experiments show the theoretical upper bounds can effectively measure the robustness by bounding the attribution differences between original and attacked images.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first theoretical quantification of worst-case robustness of attributions to perturbations. This provides a foundation to analyze the attribution deviations more rigorously.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a theoretical upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution differences between unperturbed images and perturbed images that cause no change in classification, providing a measure of model robustness against adversarial attacks on attributions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of attribution robustness:

- This paper takes a novel theoretical approach to quantifying attribution robustness by deriving upper bounds on the worst-case deviation in attributions after a sample is perturbed. Most prior work has focused on empirically evaluating and improving attribution robustness through various training methods. 

- The key innovation is formulating the problem as a constrained optimization to find the maximum attribution deviation within a small perturbed region around the original sample. This provides a bound on the robustness for any given sample, as opposed to just estimating robustness across a dataset.

- The paper considers different types of perturbations (L2, Linf norms) as well as with and without label change, providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis. The bounds apply broadly to gradient-based attribution methods.

- The bounds are validated extensively on multiple models, datasets, and perturbation methods. Over 10 million attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in practice.

- Most prior empirical work has used metrics like rank correlation, L2 distance, or cosine similarity to measure attribution differences. The theoretical bounds in this paper provide justification for using such metrics and quantify worst-case deviations.

- The bounds could potentially be integrated into training methods to optimize attribution robustness, similar to how adversarial training uses adversarial examples. This could be an interesting direction for future work.

- Overall, this paper provides a novel perspective on evaluating and reasoning about attribution robustness through a theoretical lens. The proposed bounds quantify robustness in a more principled way compared to prior empirical methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing tighter bounds for the $\ell_\infty$-norm constrained case. The upper bounds derived using the $\ell_p$-norm relaxation and the quadratic form property are looser bounds. The authors suggest exploring ways to get tighter bounds directly for the $\ell_\infty$ case.

- Improving scalability of the proposed methods for larger images. Computing the bounds under the $\ell_2$ norm becomes more costly for higher dimensional input spaces due to eigenvalue computations. Methods to improve scalability could be explored.

- Considering different dissimilarity metrics beyond Euclidean and cosine distance. The authors primarily focused on these two metrics which have been commonly used, but suggest exploring other metrics as well.

- Generalizing the bounds to other types of attribution methods beyond gradient-based attributions. The current work focuses on gradient-based methods like integrated gradients and input*gradient. Expanding to non gradient-based methods could be an interesting direction. 

- Evaluating the approach on more complex dataset like ImageNet. The authors provide some initial results but suggest more extensive validation on larger benchmark datasets.

- Validating the approach on different model architectures like CNNs and Transformers. The current validation is on feedforward networks and CNNs. Testing on more advanced architectures could be useful.

In summary, the main future directions are developing tighter bounds, improving scalability, generalizing the metrics and attribution methods used, and more extensive empirical validation on larger datasets and model architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a theoretical upper bound to quantify the worst-case deviation in model attributions after images are perturbed. The bound is formulated as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that finds the maximum attribution difference between the original image and the perturbed image, subject to the perturbation being within a certain norm ball and the classification label remaining unchanged. The specific upper bounds are derived for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity under both l2 and l-infinity norm perturbations, using properties of the attribution gradients. Experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and other datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in quantifying attribution robustness against perturbation attacks like PGD and IFIA. Overall, this is the first work to provide a theoretical guarantee on bounding worst-case attribution differences for deep neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution deviations after images are perturbed while the classification results remain unchanged. The upper bound is formulated as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the attribution difference between the original and perturbed images subject to constraints on the size of the perturbation and the classification label. Two perturbation constraints are considered - l2 norm and linfty norm. 

For l2 norm, the upper bound is derived using a first-order Taylor approximation of the attribution function and computed as the maximum singular value of the attribution gradient matrix. For linfty norm, the optimization problem becomes non-convex quadratic programming which is NP-hard, so the authors propose two relaxations - one using lp norm relaxation and another based on the sparsity of the attribution gradient. The effectiveness of the bounds is validated on different datasets, models and attacks. Over 10 million attacks show the proposed bounds can effectively quantify attribution robustness based on worst-case deviations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes methods to derive theoretical upper bounds on the worst-case attribution deviations under adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the paper formulates the general upper bound as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the attribution dissimilarity between an original sample and its perturbed version, subject to constraints on the perturbation norm and classification label. 

For $\ell_2$ norm bounded perturbations, the paper derives tight bounds using first-order Taylor approximations of the attribution functions, both with and without constraints on preserving the original classification label. For $\ell_\infty$ norm bounds, the optimization problem becomes non-convex quadratic programming, so the paper provides two relaxations to obtain practically computable bounds. The proposed bounds are evaluated empirically on multiple datasets, models and attribution methods, showing they can effectively quantify the robustness to worst-case attribution deviations. A key contribution is providing the first theoretical guarantees on bounding attribution differences under adversarial attacks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of quantifying and bounding the worst-case deviations in model attributions when images are perturbed by adversarial noise. Specifically, it aims to derive theoretical upper bounds on the maximum difference in attributions between an original image and its perturbed version, given constraints on the norm of the perturbation (e.g. L2 or L-infinity norm) and whether the classification label changes or not. 

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

1) How can we formally define and quantify the worst-case deviation in model attributions when images are adversarially attacked? 

2) Can we derive theoretical upper bounds on this worst-case attribution deviation under different norm constraints on the adversarial perturbations?

3) How tight are these theoretical upper bounds when evaluated on real models and datasets under different attack methods?

4) Do these bounds provide a useful way to measure the robustness of attributions to adversarial attacks?

So in summary, it is trying to formally define, quantify, and derive theoretical bounds on the robustness of model attributions to adversarial noise, which has not been studied rigorously before. The bounds aim to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of attributions when models are attacked.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper assumes the attribution function is locally linear within a small region around the input sample. How does this assumption affect the tightness of the proposed bounds? Can you provide some analysis on the magnitude of the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion to justify this assumption?

2. For the $\ell_\infty$ case, the paper provides two different approaches to compute the upper bound. One relies on the $\ell_p$ norm relaxation while the other utilizes the sparsity of the attribution gradient matrix. Can you compare and contrast these two methods? When will the sparsity-based approach provide a tighter bound?

3. The upper bound with label constraint relies on the axiom of completeness for attributions. How will the bound change if this axiom is not satisfied? Can you extend the analysis to non-completeness satisfying attributions?

4. The computation of upper bounds requires computing the largest singular value of the attribution gradient matrix. For high dimensional inputs, this can become expensive. Are there ways to approximate or avoid this eigenvalue computation to improve scalability?

5. The paper evaluates the bounds on relatively small image datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10. How will the proposed method perform on much larger images, such as 224x224 ImageNet samples? Are there any computational or memory bottlenecks? 

6. Apart from Euclidean and cosine distance, are there other dissimilarity metrics for attributions that could utilize the proposed bounding techniques? For example, can statistical correlation measures like Pearson coefficient be bounded in a similar way?

7. The experiments mostly focus on gradient-based attribution methods. How will the assumptions and analysis change if non-gradient methods like occlusion or SHAP are used? Can the bounds be extended to these types of attributions?

8. The bounds are evaluated on adversarial training and attributional robustness techniques. How tight are the bounds on a standard non-robust model? Will the bounds be very loose in that case?

9. For real-world application, how can the proposed bounds guide the selection of attribution method or model architecture? What are the practical implications of having guarantees on worst-case attribution deviations?

10. The paper assumes a fixed norm-bounded threat model for perturbations. How can the analysis be extended to more complex perturbation constraints, for example, Wasserstein distance or perceptual similarity metrics?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a theoretical upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution deviations for deep neural networks. The bound is formulated as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that finds the maximum difference between the original attributions and attributions of adversarially perturbed inputs. The constraints include bounding the perturbation to be small and imperceptible based on lp norms, as well as optionally constraining the label to remain unchanged. Theoretical bounds are derived for both l2 and l∞ perturbations, with and without the label constraint, using properties of gradients and Taylor expansions of the attributions. The bounds for l2 leverage the singular values of the attribution Jacobian while the l∞ bounds use a novel relaxation that exploits gradient sparsity. Experiments across models, datasets and attacks validate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in practice. Overall, this is the first work to theoretically quantify attribution robustness and experimental results demonstrate the bounds effectively measure model robustness based on worst-case divergence of attributions before and after imperceptible input perturbations.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an upper bound that measures the worst-case attribution deviations for deep neural networks. Given a trained model, an input sample, and a constrained perturbation region, the bound finds the maximum dissimilarity between the original and perturbed attributions while keeping the classification output unchanged. The general bound is formulated as an optimization problem with norm and label constraints. Specific approaches are introduced to derive tight bounds for Euclidean and cosine distance metrics under both l2-norm and l-infinity norm perturbations. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet validate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds, indicating they can quantify model robustness based on the worst-case differences in attributions when samples are attacked by perturbations. Overall, this is the first work to provide a theoretical upper bound on attribution deviations that measures model robustness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a general upper bound formulation for attribution deviations. What are the key components of this formulation and how do they capture the worst-case attribution difference? Discuss the intuitions behind the formulation.

2. The paper derives upper bounds for both Euclidean distance and cosine similarity under $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ norm constraints. Walk through the derivations and explain the assumptions made. How do the bounds differ between the two metrics and norm constraints?

3. For the $\ell_2$ norm case without label constraints, the paper utilizes the first-order Taylor series approximation of the attribution function. Explain why this approximation is valid given the assumptions. How does the tightness of the bound depend on the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion?

4. The upper bound derivation under $\ell_\infty$ norm constraints results in a non-convex quadratic optimization problem. Discuss the challenges posed by this problem and how the authors provide practical relaxations to obtain tractable bounds. 

5. With label constraints, the paper claims the $\ell_2$ norm bound can be achieved by considering the second best label. Provide an intuitive explanation of why this is true. How does this relate to the axiom of completeness?

6. The experiments evaluate the bounds on models trained with different attribution and adversarial robustness techniques. Analyze the results and discuss how the tightness of the bounds correlates with model robustness.

7. The theoretical bounds make certain assumptions about the smoothness and local linearity of the attribution functions. Critically evaluate the validity of these assumptions based on the analysis and results presented. Suggest ways to further verify the assumptions.

8. Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach in terms of scalability to high dimensional input spaces. How do the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ bounds differ in terms of computational complexity? 

9. The bounds are evaluated on different datasets, perturbation sizes, and attribution methods. What additional experiments could provide further insights into the tightness and generalizability of the bounds?

10. The paper aims to provide certified bounds on worst-case attribution deviations. Discuss how these bounds could be incorporated into developing more robust models and training procedures. What are other potential applications?
