# [A Practical Upper Bound for the Worst-Case Attribution Deviations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00340)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we quantitatively bound the worst-case deviation in model attributions when inputs are perturbed within a certain region while maintaining the original classification output?

The key points are:

- The paper aims to derive theoretical upper bounds on the maximum difference in model attributions when inputs are perturbed, but classification outputs remain unchanged. 

- This provides a measure of the robustness of model attributions against perturbations. Smaller upper bounds indicate more robust attributions.

- The attributions considered are for gradient-based methods like integrated gradients, which are widely used for model interpretability.

- The perturbations are constrained to be small in either L2 or Linfinity norm so that inputs remain visually similar. 

- Upper bounds are derived both with and without constraining the classification output to remain unchanged. The bounds with label constraints are tighter.

- The theoretical bounds are validated on image datasets like CIFAR-10 against perturbation methods like PGD attacks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that tight theoretical upper bounds can be derived on attribution deviations under input perturbations, providing a robustness measure for model interpretations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution deviations after images are perturbed while the classification results remain unchanged. Specifically:

- The paper formulates a constrained optimization problem to find the maximum change of attributions under certain norm constraints on the perturbation and label constraint. This provides a general framework to quantify attribution robustness.

- For Euclidean distance and cosine distance metrics, tight upper bounds are derived for $\ell_2$ norm bounded perturbations, with and without label constraints. 

- For more challenging $\ell_\infty$ norm bounded perturbations, the paper provides two practical approaches to estimate the upper bounds.

- The proposed bounds are evaluated on different datasets, models and attack methods. Experiments show the theoretical upper bounds can effectively measure the robustness by bounding the attribution differences between original and attacked images.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the first theoretical quantification of worst-case robustness of attributions to perturbations. This provides a foundation to analyze the attribution deviations more rigorously.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a theoretical upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution differences between unperturbed images and perturbed images that cause no change in classification, providing a measure of model robustness against adversarial attacks on attributions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of attribution robustness:

- This paper takes a novel theoretical approach to quantifying attribution robustness by deriving upper bounds on the worst-case deviation in attributions after a sample is perturbed. Most prior work has focused on empirically evaluating and improving attribution robustness through various training methods. 

- The key innovation is formulating the problem as a constrained optimization to find the maximum attribution deviation within a small perturbed region around the original sample. This provides a bound on the robustness for any given sample, as opposed to just estimating robustness across a dataset.

- The paper considers different types of perturbations (L2, Linf norms) as well as with and without label change, providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis. The bounds apply broadly to gradient-based attribution methods.

- The bounds are validated extensively on multiple models, datasets, and perturbation methods. Over 10 million attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in practice.

- Most prior empirical work has used metrics like rank correlation, L2 distance, or cosine similarity to measure attribution differences. The theoretical bounds in this paper provide justification for using such metrics and quantify worst-case deviations.

- The bounds could potentially be integrated into training methods to optimize attribution robustness, similar to how adversarial training uses adversarial examples. This could be an interesting direction for future work.

- Overall, this paper provides a novel perspective on evaluating and reasoning about attribution robustness through a theoretical lens. The proposed bounds quantify robustness in a more principled way compared to prior empirical methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Developing tighter bounds for the $\ell_\infty$-norm constrained case. The upper bounds derived using the $\ell_p$-norm relaxation and the quadratic form property are looser bounds. The authors suggest exploring ways to get tighter bounds directly for the $\ell_\infty$ case.

- Improving scalability of the proposed methods for larger images. Computing the bounds under the $\ell_2$ norm becomes more costly for higher dimensional input spaces due to eigenvalue computations. Methods to improve scalability could be explored.

- Considering different dissimilarity metrics beyond Euclidean and cosine distance. The authors primarily focused on these two metrics which have been commonly used, but suggest exploring other metrics as well.

- Generalizing the bounds to other types of attribution methods beyond gradient-based attributions. The current work focuses on gradient-based methods like integrated gradients and input*gradient. Expanding to non gradient-based methods could be an interesting direction. 

- Evaluating the approach on more complex dataset like ImageNet. The authors provide some initial results but suggest more extensive validation on larger benchmark datasets.

- Validating the approach on different model architectures like CNNs and Transformers. The current validation is on feedforward networks and CNNs. Testing on more advanced architectures could be useful.

In summary, the main future directions are developing tighter bounds, improving scalability, generalizing the metrics and attribution methods used, and more extensive empirical validation on larger datasets and model architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a theoretical upper bound to quantify the worst-case deviation in model attributions after images are perturbed. The bound is formulated as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that finds the maximum attribution difference between the original image and the perturbed image, subject to the perturbation being within a certain norm ball and the classification label remaining unchanged. The specific upper bounds are derived for Euclidean distance and cosine similarity under both l2 and l-infinity norm perturbations, using properties of the attribution gradients. Experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and other datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in quantifying attribution robustness against perturbation attacks like PGD and IFIA. Overall, this is the first work to provide a theoretical guarantee on bounding worst-case attribution differences for deep neural networks.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes an upper bound to quantify the worst-case attribution deviations after images are perturbed while the classification results remain unchanged. The upper bound is formulated as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the attribution difference between the original and perturbed images subject to constraints on the size of the perturbation and the classification label. Two perturbation constraints are considered - l2 norm and linfty norm. 

For l2 norm, the upper bound is derived using a first-order Taylor approximation of the attribution function and computed as the maximum singular value of the attribution gradient matrix. For linfty norm, the optimization problem becomes non-convex quadratic programming which is NP-hard, so the authors propose two relaxations - one using lp norm relaxation and another based on the sparsity of the attribution gradient. The effectiveness of the bounds is validated on different datasets, models and attacks. Over 10 million attacks show the proposed bounds can effectively quantify attribution robustness based on worst-case deviations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes methods to derive theoretical upper bounds on the worst-case attribution deviations under adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the paper formulates the general upper bound as the solution to a constrained optimization problem that maximizes the attribution dissimilarity between an original sample and its perturbed version, subject to constraints on the perturbation norm and classification label. 

For $\ell_2$ norm bounded perturbations, the paper derives tight bounds using first-order Taylor approximations of the attribution functions, both with and without constraints on preserving the original classification label. For $\ell_\infty$ norm bounds, the optimization problem becomes non-convex quadratic programming, so the paper provides two relaxations to obtain practically computable bounds. The proposed bounds are evaluated empirically on multiple datasets, models and attribution methods, showing they can effectively quantify the robustness to worst-case attribution deviations. A key contribution is providing the first theoretical guarantees on bounding attribution differences under adversarial attacks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of quantifying and bounding the worst-case deviations in model attributions when images are perturbed by adversarial noise. Specifically, it aims to derive theoretical upper bounds on the maximum difference in attributions between an original image and its perturbed version, given constraints on the norm of the perturbation (e.g. L2 or L-infinity norm) and whether the classification label changes or not. 

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

1) How can we formally define and quantify the worst-case deviation in model attributions when images are adversarially attacked? 

2) Can we derive theoretical upper bounds on this worst-case attribution deviation under different norm constraints on the adversarial perturbations?

3) How tight are these theoretical upper bounds when evaluated on real models and datasets under different attack methods?

4) Do these bounds provide a useful way to measure the robustness of attributions to adversarial attacks?

So in summary, it is trying to formally define, quantify, and derive theoretical bounds on the robustness of model attributions to adversarial noise, which has not been studied rigorously before. The bounds aim to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of attributions when models are attacked.
