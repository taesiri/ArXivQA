# [AFaCTA: Assisting the Annotation of Factual Claim Detection with   Reliable LLM Annotators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11073)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There are two major challenges in developing datasets for automatic factual claim detection: (1) Inconsistencies in how claims and the claim detection task are defined across different works, and (2) the high cost of manual annotation.

- There is confusion regarding what constitutes a "claim" across areas like automated fact checking and argument mining. There are also discrepancies in whether the task is defined as detecting check-worthy claims versus factual versus non-factual claims. 

- Manually creating annotated datasets is expensive and time-consuming, which limits the scalability and generalization of models trained on them.

Proposed Solution:
- They propose a definition of "factual claim" focused on verifiability rather than check-worthiness to maximize objectivity. A statement is verifiable if it provides enough specifics for evidence retrieval.

- They introduce AFaCTA, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to assist in annotating factual claims. It has 3 steps aimed at disentangling facts from opinions, and determining verifiability. 

- AFaCTA calibrates annotation confidence based on consistency across the 3 steps. Perfectly consistent samples are high accuracy and can be labeled automatically to reduce manual effort.

Main Contributions:
- A review of claim definitions and a proposed verifiability-focused definition for claim detection.  

- The AFaCTA framework for reliably assisting claim annotation using consistency-calibrated LLMs annotations.

- PoliClaim, a labeled dataset of factual claims spanning 25 years of diverse political speech topics, annotated using AFaCTA.

- Analyses demonstrating AFaCTA can efficiently assist claim annotation and training accurate classifiers. Its perfectly consistent annotations are a strong substitute for expert labels.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces AFaCTA, a framework that leverages large language models to assist in annotating factual claims for automated fact-checking, ensuring reliability through consistency across reasoning paths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a clear definition of factual claims for fact-checking that focuses on verifiability rather than check-worthiness. This helps address inconsistencies in prior work. 

2. It introduces AFaCTA, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist in annotating factual claims. AFaCTA ensures reliability by calibrating annotation confidence based on consistency across different reasoning paths.

3. It uses AFaCTA to annotate PoliClaim, a new dataset spanning 25 years of U.S. political speeches across various topics. Experiments show AFaCTA's consistent annotations can effectively train classifiers and augment limited labeled data.

4. It provides extensive analyses evaluating AFaCTA on the political speech domain and briefly on social media data. The analyses give insights into where LLMs succeed and fail in assisting factual claim annotation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing AFaCTA to reliably leverage LLMs to make factual claim annotation more efficient and scalable, as demonstrated through the new PoliClaim dataset.

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Factual claim detection
- Misinformation/disinformation
- Fact checking
- Claim definitions
- Verifiability
- Check-worthiness  
- Annotation assistance
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Self-consistency
- Political speeches
- AFaCTA framework
- GPT-3.5
- GPT-4

The paper proposes a framework called AFaCTA that uses large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to assist in annotating factual claims in domains like political speeches. It focuses on the verifiability aspect of claim definitions and uses self-consistency across different reasoning paths to ensure reliable LLM annotations. The PoliClaim dataset spanning 25 years of US political speeches is introduced. Overall, the key ideas revolve around leveraging LLMs to efficiently and reliably annotate data for building factual claim detection systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called AFaCTA to assist in annotating factual claims. Can you explain in detail the multiple steps involved in AFaCTA and the intuition behind having these different steps?

2. One key aspect of AFaCTA is using consistency across different reasoning paths to determine the reliability of the annotations. Can you analyze the pros and cons of using consistency versus other potential reliability metrics?

3. The paper argues that pretrained language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can assist in factual claim annotation. What are some of the challenges and limitations in using these models for this task based on the error analysis? 

4. The paper finds that GPT-4 outperforms human experts on the subsets where perfect consistency is achieved across reasoning paths. What could be some reasons why consistency correlates with accuracy in annotation?

5. The prompts used in AFaCTA seem to encode certain assumptions about what constitutes a factual claim. How might the design of prompts further be improved to reduce annotation errors?  

6. Could the AFaCTA framework be extended to other related NLP tasks that require reliable annotations from language models? What task-specific modifications would need to be made?

7. The paper analyzes performance on political speeches and a small Twitter dataset. Would the conclusions generalize to other high-stake domains like scientific papers, legal documents, etc.?

8. The paper relies primarily on model-generated self-consistency, but also shows human annotations are useful. What could be an optimal combination of automated and human supervision?

9. What kinds of classifiers and fine-tuning approaches could further improve performance when trained on the annotated datasets produced by AFaCTA?

10. The paper focuses on assisting annotation of factual claims. Could similar techniques be developed to annotate subjective opinions and personal stances entangled with facts?
