# [Vulnerability of Automatic Identity Recognition to Audio-Visual   Deepfakes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17655)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents SWAN-DF, the first high fidelity publicly available dataset of realistic audio-visual deepfakes where both faces and voices closely resemble the target person. The authors created the dataset by swapping faces and voices between 60 pairs of people from the SWAN database using state-of-the-art generative models like DeepFaceLab and FreeVC. They generated over 20 visual and 8 audio variants per video, with differences in models, resolutions, and blending techniques, resulting in over 150,000 possible combinations. Along with SWAN-DF, they also released LibriTTS-DF, a dataset of 39 speakers from LibriTTS converted using YourTTS, Adaspeech TTS, and Tortoise TTS. Through extensive experiments with MobileFaceNet and SpeechBrain speaker verification systems, they demonstrated over 90% vulnerability on the personalized fake videos and 80-86% on the speech fakes. The large variability and high threat levels posed by these datasets can aid researchers in developing more robust and generalizable fake detection methods. The paper makes both datasets publicly available to facilitate future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents the first high fidelity publicly available dataset of realistic audio-visual deepfakes, SWAN-DF, where both faces and voices are well synchronized, appear and sound like the target person, and are shown to spoof state of the art speaker and face recognition systems over 90% of the time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Presenting SWAN-DF, the first high fidelity publicly available dataset of realistic audio-visual deepfakes where both faces and voices convincingly impersonate the target identities. 

2) Generating a large variety (over 20) of deepfake face swapping variants using different models and blending techniques to aid more robust deepfake detection research.

3) Releasing a separate LibriTTS-DF dataset containing only voice deepfakes generated using multiple state-of-the-art text-to-speech and voice conversion methods.

4) Conducting extensive vulnerability analysis to demonstrate that the generated deepfakes successfully spoof state-of-the-art face recognition (MobileFaceNet) and speaker recognition (ECAPA-TDNN) systems over 90% of the time.

5) Making the datasets, source code, and full experimental results publicly available to verify and reproduce the vulnerability assessments and facilitate further research.

In summary, the key contribution is creating and releasing high quality multimodal deepfake datasets along with vulnerability benchmarks to push deepfake detection research forward.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Deepfakes - The paper focuses on creating and detecting realistic audio-visual deepfakes.

- Face swapping - One of the main methods used to generate visual deepfakes is face swapping, where the face of one person is swapped with another. 

- Voice conversion - Audio deepfakes are generated using voice conversion techniques to make one person's voice sound like another.

- Vulnerability assessment - The paper evaluates the vulnerability of face recognition and speaker recognition systems to the generated deepfakes. 

- SWAN-DF - This is the name of the audio-visual deepfake dataset created by the authors using the SWAN dataset.

- LibriTTS-DF - A separate dataset of only audio deepfakes generated from the LibriTTS dataset.

- Models used - The paper utilizes models like DeepFaceLab, YourTTS, FreeVC, Adaspeech, and Tortoise for generating deepfakes.

- Blending techniques - Different blending techniques are used when inserting the fake face into the video to make it look more realistic.

- Metrics - Metrics like false match rate (FMR), false non-match rate (FNMR) and impostor attack presentation match rate (IAPMR) are used to assess vulnerability.

So in summary, the key terms cover deepfake generation, datasets created, models used, blending techniques, and vulnerability assessment.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using several variants of blending techniques when generating the deepfake videos. Can you expand more on what specific techniques were used and what impact they have on the visual quality and detectable artifacts in the resulted deepfakes?

2. You tuned the generative models like DeepFaceLab and FreeVC for each pair of identities to create the realistic fakes. What were the key tuning parameters and optimization strategies used? How long was the tuning process?  

3. What loss functions and training procedures allow the generative models like DeepFaceLab and FreeVC to preserve or transfer the original identity to the generated fake? 

4. The paper evaluates vulnerability of recognition systems to deepfakes. What other systems, besides face and speaker recognition, could be vulnerable? How would you design experiments to evaluate those?

5. What are the key Advancements in DeepFaceLab, FreeVC and other generative models used that allow generating such realistic fakes compared to the models from 2-3 years ago?

6. You used several blending and post-processing techniques that result in different deepfake artifacts. Can you elaborate more on the difference in distortions between models like DeepFaceLab vs YourTTS and FreeVC? 

7. What is still lacking in the current deepfake generation methods that prevent them from creating even more realistic fakes that could fool humans?

8. Did you conduct any subjective evaluations or human perceptual studies? If yes, what were the results compared to the automated systems? If no, how would you design such a study?

9. The datasets you generated aim to promote generalized deepfake detection methods. What characteristics make them useful for this goal compared to other existing datasets?  

10. Besides datasets and detection methods, what other countermeasures do you think are important to mitigate the negative societal impact of deepfakes?
