# [Sora as an AGI World Model? A Complete Survey on Text-to-Video   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the evolution of text-to-video generation models, with a focus on the recent Sora model by OpenAI. 

The paper first provides background on the core technologies used in text-to-video models, including convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), vision transformers (ViTs), CLIP text embeddings, and different generative modeling approaches like VAEs, GANs, autoregressive models, and diffusion models.

It then chronicles the progression of text-to-video generation from early template-based and rule-based systems to more advanced deep learning models. Key milestones highlighted include the shift from GANs to autoregressive models to handle temporal dynamics better, and the eventual dominance of diffusion models like DDPM in creating high-fidelity videos from text. 

The paper summarizes the general frameworks used by different architectures - GAN, autoregressive and diffusion-based models - to generate videos from text descriptions. It also introduces Sora, OpenAI's scalable text-to-video diffusion model based on the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) backbone.

Besides generative modeling, the paper also explores the growing field of text-conditioned video editing techniques using frameworks like Layered Neural Atlases and DDIM inversion with attention injection. 

Evaluation metrics commonly used to benchmark text-to-video models on quality, text-visual coherence and human perception are reviewed. The paper also highlights current prototypes and potential applications in industries like marketing, education and entertainment.  

Limitations around issues like handling multiple entities, comprehending causality, scaling inconsistencies and object hallucination are discussed. Ethical concerns around misuse for disinformation and lack of transparency are also raised.

Finally, the prospect of using future descendants of models like Sora as assistive tools, world simulators and metaverse environments is discussed. Research directions are proposed to improve text-video alignment through more balanced datasets, multidimensional evaluation, and increased user-centric testing.
