## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) framework called Expand-and-Quantize Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (EQUSS). The key innovation is using high-dimensional spaces to improve clusterability of features, combined with product quantization for effective information compression. Specifically, EQUSS first expands the backbone features to high dimensions, which helps separate classes more easily. Then product quantization compresses the features while retaining class-relevant information. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the paper provides the first analysis of USS from an information theory perspective by quantifying feature entropy. A relationship is established between entropy and segmentation accuracy - classes with more diversity require more bits for representation and achieve lower accuracy. The compact features and superior performance of EQUSS show that expanding dimensions can benefit clustering, while quantization successfully filters irrelevant information.
