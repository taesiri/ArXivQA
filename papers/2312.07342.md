## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) framework called Expand-and-Quantize Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (EQUSS). The key innovation is using high-dimensional spaces to improve clusterability of features, combined with product quantization for effective information compression. Specifically, EQUSS first expands the backbone features to high dimensions, which helps separate classes more easily. Then product quantization compresses the features while retaining class-relevant information. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the paper provides the first analysis of USS from an information theory perspective by quantifying feature entropy. A relationship is established between entropy and segmentation accuracy - classes with more diversity require more bits for representation and achieve lower accuracy. The compact features and superior performance of EQUSS show that expanding dimensions can benefit clustering, while quantization successfully filters irrelevant information.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Expand-and-Quantize: Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation Using High-Dimensional Space and Product Quantization":

Problem:
Unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) aims to segment images into meaningful categories without using any labels. Two key abilities are required for successful USS: 1) information compression to remove irrelevant details while retaining class-related information and 2) clustering capability to group similar pixels into classes. Prior USS methods rely on feature dimension reduction for compression, but this may hinder clustering performance. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel USS framework called Expand-and-Quantize Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation (EQUSS). Instead of dimension reduction, EQUSS first expands the feature dimension to take advantage of high-dimensional space's benefits for clustering. It then applies product quantization to compress the expanded features. This combines the strengths of high-dimensional features for better separation of classes and product quantization for effective compression.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes EQUSS, a new USS architecture using feature expansion and product quantization. This is the first USS method to use either technique.
- Achieves state-of-the-art USS performance on three benchmarks, outperforming prior arts by a large margin.
- Analyzes the information capacity of USS features using entropy for the first time. Discovers relationships between entropy, feature diversity, and accuracy.
- Shows EQUSS represents classes with fewer bits than previous methods. It also allocates bits according to class complexity.
- Establishes connections between information theory concepts and USS to provide design guidelines.

In summary, this paper puts forth a novel perspective to address limitations of prior USS techniques. By expanding high-dimensional features and quantizing them, EQUSS pushes USS performance to new heights. The information-theoretic analysis also offers new insights into interpreting and improving USS methods.
