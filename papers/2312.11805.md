# [Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Developing capable AI systems that can understand and reason across multiple modalities like text, images, audio and video is an important research challenge. Most existing models specialize in a single domain.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces Gemini, a family of multimodal models consisting of Ultra, Pro and Nano sizes. These models are trained jointly on large-scale datasets across text, images, audio and video to develop strong general capabilities across modalities.

Key Technical Details:
- Gemini models build on transformer architectures and are trained with sequences up to 32,768 tokens. They can take interleaved inputs across modalities. 
- Specialized model sizes target complex reasoning (Ultra), scalable deployment (Pro) and on-device usage (Nano).

Contributions:
- Gemini Ultra sets new SOTA results on 30 out of 32 academic benchmarks covering capabilities in text, images, audio, video and reasoning.
- It is the first model to surpass human expert performance on the exam benchmark MMLU, scoring 90%.  
- Gemini models set new SOTA on 20 out of 20 multimodal benchmarks.
- Qualitative analysis shows new multimodal reasoning capabilities like generating matplotlib code to edit an input plot or suggesting ways a soccer player can improve technique from video frames.
- Responsible development process includes impact assessments, model policies and extensive evaluations.

Conclusion:
- Gemini models open new avenues for research and applications leveraging unified multimodal understanding and reasoning. Limitations around reliability and reasoning capabilities need more investigation.
