# [Adversarial Style Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12643)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How to expand the potential statistics space for more diverse style augmentations to improve domain generalization performance?The key hypothesis appears to be:By performing feature statistics perturbation via adversarial training, one can explore a broader style space and generate more diverse style augmentations. This will lead to improved domain generalization performance.Specifically, the paper proposes an Adversarial Style Augmentation (ASA) method, where the perturbations to feature statistics (mean and standard deviation) are learned via adversarial training rather than being limited to batch statistics. This allows exploration of a less constrained statistics space. The ASA method is instantiated via a proposed AdvStyle module. The experiments aim to validate whether:1) The proposed ASA method and AdvStyle module can improve performance on domain generalization tasks like classification and retrieval compared to prior style augmentation methods.2) The method results in more robust performance across domains/tasks with lower variance.3) The method is complementary to existing domain generalization algorithms.So in summary, the core research question is whether adversarial training for style augmentation can expand the style space and improve domain generalization, which is validated through experiments on various tasks.
