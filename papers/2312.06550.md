# [LLM360: Towards Fully Transparent Open-Source LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Recent open-source LLMs like LLaMA, Falcon, and Mistral provide good options for practitioners, but most only release partial artifacts like final weights or inference code. Details on training and datasets are limited. 
- This lack of transparency hinders progress by forcing teams to rediscover training details, makes assessing reliability and bias harder, reduces reproducibility, and limits studies requiring intermediate checkpoints.

Proposed Solution - LLM360:
- LLM360 is an initiative to fully open source LLMs by releasing all training code/data/configs, intermediate checkpoints, and metrics. 
- Goals are to support open and collaborative AI research, make LLM training transparent and reproducible, and address issues like assessing model biases.

Key Contributions:
- Outlined LLM360 framework that defines release components like datasets, code, checkpoints, and metrics to guide transparency.
- Released two new 7B parameter LLMs, Amber and Crystal. Details:
  - Amber is an English LLM trained on 1.3T tokens. 
  - Crystal mixes English and code trained on 1.4T tokens over 3 stages.
- Released full training code, 360 Amber checkpoints, 143 Crystal checkpoints, configs/hyperparameters, and preprocessing code and datasets.
- Shared preliminary benchmark evaluations on Amber and Crystal.
- Discussed observations from pretraining like dealing with NaN losses.
- Released Analysis360 code to demonstrate sample checkpoint analysis by assessing memorization.

Overall the paper introduces LLM360, an open framework for releasing transparent and reproducible LLMs. It also releases Amber and Crystal models under this framework to demonstrate its utility.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces LLM360, an initiative to release fully open-source large language models with all training artifacts to promote transparency and collaboration in AI research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces LLM360, an initiative for releasing large language models (LLMs) with full transparency and reproducibility. LLM360 advocates releasing all training code, data, configurations, intermediate checkpoints, and evaluation metrics. 

2) It releases two new open-source LLMs as the first models under LLM360: Amber, a 7B parameter English LLM, and Crystal, a 7B parameter English and code LLM. Both are released with full training and evaluation details.

3) It provides preliminary analyses and benchmark evaluations of Amber and Crystal, comparing them to other recent open-source LLMs. It also demonstrates sample analyses that can be done on the checkpoints, such as studying memorization during training.

4) It discusses lessons learned and best practices from pretraining Amber and Crystal, as well as potential use cases enabled by the release of intermediate training artifacts through LLM360.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and release of LLM360, a framework to promote transparency and reproducibility of LLMs through comprehensive release of training artifacts, as demonstrated on two new open-source LLMs, Amber and Crystal.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a hybrid parallelism strategy that combines data, tensor-model, and pipeline (3D) parallelism. Can you elaborate more on how this hybrid strategy works and why it achieves better system throughput than standard parallelism strategies like FSDP?

2. When encountering NaN losses during Amber's pretraining, the paper mentions skipping problematic data chunks or switching random seeds. Were there any other strategies explored to mitigate NaN losses? How effective were these strategies in allowing training to continue? 

3. For the memorization analysis conducted on Amber, was any relationship observed between checkpoints that had higher memorization scores and their performance on downstream tasks? Could overfitting on the training data be a concern?

4. The paper argues the LLM360 framework can help identify bias risks in LLMs by inspecting the training data. But how feasible is manual inspection at the scale of billions of tokens? Were any automated bias analysis techniques applied as well?

5. Crystal employs a gradual 3-stage pretraining strategy combining English and code data, unlike models trained strictly sequentially. What was the motivation for this strategy? How did it impact model performance?

6. How was the pretrain/finetune checkpoint selected for AmberChat and AmberSafe? What criteria should be used for selecting the optimal checkpoint to start finetuning from?

7. For the potential use cases of LLM360 discussed, what are some specific techniques that could be used to adjust data ratios on the fly when resuming pretraining from a checkpoint?

8. The paper mentions discrepancies in checkpoint precision early in Amber's pretraining. What impact would lower-precision checkpoints have on model quality or finetuning performance?

9. How do the training efficiencies and throughput compare between Amber pretrained on GPUs versus Crystal on the Cerebras system? What hardware-specific optimizations were employed?

10. The analysis of memorization behavior seems heavily focused on Amber. For Crystal, what differences were observed in terms of memorization across the 3 pretraining stages?
