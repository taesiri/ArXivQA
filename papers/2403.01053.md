# [Seeing Unseen: Discover Novel Biomedical Concepts via   Geometry-Constrained Probabilistic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of discovering novel biomedical concepts from observational data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, it aims to identify novel phenotypes and group unlabeled instances into clusters corresponding to these unseen concepts. This is challenging due to two key issues:

1) Distribution shift across datasets due to inconsistent imaging protocols, leading to ambiguous representations. 

2) Severe class imbalance between known base classes with ample training data and rare/novel classes, causing representation bias.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling approach to address these issues from two perspectives:

1) Model instance embeddings as von Mises-Fisher distributions on a hypersphere to capture representation uncertainty and decouple imaging artifacts from semantics.

2) Incorporate geometric inductive biases of "boundness" and "uniformity" to constrain the layout of the embedding space - bounding base classes and dispersing open space to minimize risk.

Main Contributions:

1) A new direction of utilizing representation learning for automated biomedical discovery from observational data.

2) Geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling to account for data distribution biases and enable risk-bounded discovery.

3) Spectral graph-based method for efficient and taxonomy-adaptive estimation of potential novel classes.

4) Extensive validation across diverse biomedical scenarios demonstrating superiority over existing methods in discovering and clustering novel concepts.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in facilitating biomedical discovery via unsupervised learning under practical conditions of distribution shift and label imbalance. The proposed geometrical regularization of the embedding space is a simple yet effective solution.
