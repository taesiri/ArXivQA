# [Seeing Unseen: Discover Novel Biomedical Concepts via   Geometry-Constrained Probabilistic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper tackles the problem of discovering novel biomedical concepts from observational data in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, it aims to identify novel phenotypes and group unlabeled instances into clusters corresponding to these unseen concepts. This is challenging due to two key issues:

1) Distribution shift across datasets due to inconsistent imaging protocols, leading to ambiguous representations. 

2) Severe class imbalance between known base classes with ample training data and rare/novel classes, causing representation bias.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling approach to address these issues from two perspectives:

1) Model instance embeddings as von Mises-Fisher distributions on a hypersphere to capture representation uncertainty and decouple imaging artifacts from semantics.

2) Incorporate geometric inductive biases of "boundness" and "uniformity" to constrain the layout of the embedding space - bounding base classes and dispersing open space to minimize risk.

Main Contributions:

1) A new direction of utilizing representation learning for automated biomedical discovery from observational data.

2) Geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling to account for data distribution biases and enable risk-bounded discovery.

3) Spectral graph-based method for efficient and taxonomy-adaptive estimation of potential novel classes.

4) Extensive validation across diverse biomedical scenarios demonstrating superiority over existing methods in discovering and clustering novel concepts.

Overall, the paper makes notable contributions in facilitating biomedical discovery via unsupervised learning under practical conditions of distribution shift and label imbalance. The proposed geometrical regularization of the embedding space is a simple yet effective solution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling framework to address challenges in novel biomedical concept discovery from non-i.i.d. data with long-tailed distributions by decoupling task-irrelevant attributes, imposing inductive biases to bound risks, and devising a spectral method for taxonomy-adaptive estimation of potential novel classes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are four-fold:

(i) It introduces a new paradigm to apply deep learning to facilitate data-driven biomedical discovery and account for the distribution biases inherently present in the domain.

(ii) It proposes geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling to facilitate risk-bounded novel class discovery by exploiting the "boundness" and "uniformity" geometrical inductive biases for representation space structuring. It also provides theoretical justifications for the merits of the proposed method.

(iii) It devises a spectral graph-theoretic method to estimate the potential number of novel classes in unlabeled observational data. This method is computationally efficient, taxonomy-adaptive, and does not require recursive clustering.

(iv) The proposed method is extensively validated on a diverse suite of challenging biomedical scenarios and shown to outperform existing solutions for novel class discovery despite distribution shifts and label imbalance.

In summary, the main contribution is a new deep learning paradigm and associated techniques to enable automated discovery of novel biomedical concepts from observational data in a robust and efficient manner.

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Novel class discovery - The paper focuses on discovering and identifying novel or unseen classes in data. This is referred to as novel class discovery.

- Generalized novel class discovery - An extension of novel class discovery where both known base classes and novel classes can appear in the unlabeled data simultaneously.

- Geometry-constrained probabilistic modeling - The paper proposes using this approach, which incorporates geometric inductive biases and models instance embeddings as probabilistic distributions, to address challenges in novel class discovery.

- Hyperspherical manifold - The probabilistic instance embeddings are modeled as von Mises-Fisher distributions on a hyperspherical manifold.

- Boundness and uniformity - Key geometric properties identified in the paper for structuring the embedding space in order to bound risks for novel classes and ensure uniformity.

- Spectral graph theory - Used to devise the class number estimation method, which identifies the number of potential novel classes in unlabeled data.

Some other key concepts include representation learning, clustering, biomedical concept discovery, distribution shift, and long-tailed data distributions. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes to model the posterior of instance embeddings as von Mises-Fisher distributions. Why is this distribution suitable for probabilistic modeling on hyperspherical manifolds compared to Gaussian distributions? 

2. Two key geometric properties, boundness and uniformity, are identified in the paper for embedding space structuring. Explain why imposing these constraints helps minimize the risks for novel class discovery.

3. The paper argues that explicit modeling of the "dark information" about novel classes is crucial. Elaborate what is meant by dark information in this context and how the proposed method tries to address it.  

4. Uniform proxies are established a priori in the method through energy minimization. Explain the intuition behind using the potential energy function for proxy distribution and how it leads to uniformity.

5. How does the concentration parameter in the von Mises-Fisher distribution help in dynamically weighing the contribution of different instances based on their representation uncertainty?

6. Explain the effect of imposing the KL divergence minimization objective between instance-wise vMF distributions and Dirac delta distributions centered on base class proxies. How does it contribute to base space bounding?

7. What is the motivation behind using proxy-driven semantic consensus for open space structuring? Analyze how it encourages uniform distribution and separation of novel classes.  

8. The method proposes a spectral graph-based approach for novel class number estimation. Elaborate the theoretical basis it utilizes to characterize the connectivity of the underlying manifold.  

9. How does the proposed class number estimation strategy support taxonomy-adaptive estimation for different hierarchical levels of biomedical concepts?

10. Analyze the superiority of the proposed probabilistic modeling approach compared to existing self-training strategies for novel class discovery under non-i.i.d. data.
