# Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Conditional Text   Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we mitigate the "exposure bias" problem in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for conditional text generation, where models are trained only with teacher forcing using ground truth labels and not exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training?The key hypothesis proposed is that contrasting positive input-output pairs with negative pairs, to expose the model to both valid and incorrect variations of the inputs, can improve the generalization performance of seq2seq models. Specifically, the paper proposes a principled method called CLAPS (Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Seq2seq) to automatically generate "hard" positive and negative pairs to guide the model to better distinguish correct vs incorrect outputs. The negative pairs are generated by adding small perturbations to minimize conditional likelihood, while positive pairs are generated with larger perturbations to be far from the input embedding while preserving high likelihood.The central hypothesis is that training seq2seq models with such automatically constructed difficult positive and negative pairs within a contrastive learning framework can mitigate exposure bias and improve generalization on unseen inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a contrastive learning framework with adversarial perturbations to improve generalization for conditional text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question generation. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Using contrastive learning to train the seq2seq model by maximizing similarity between positive pairs (input and target text) while minimizing similarity to negative pairs. This exposes the model to various valid and incorrect outputs during training.- Generating "hard" positive and negative examples via adversarial perturbations, rather than using random non-target texts as negative examples. The adversarial examples are more difficult for the model to discriminate.- Negative examples are generated by adding small perturbations to minimize the conditional likelihood of the target text. - Positive examples are generated by adding larger perturbations to maximize distance from the input while keeping conditional likelihood high.- The adversarial positive and negative pairs guide the model to better distinguish correct vs incorrect outputs, improving generalization.- Empirically showing the method improves performance on machine translation, summarization, and question generation over baselines.So in summary, the key contribution is using principled adversarial perturbations to construct better positive/negative pairs for contrastive learning, which improves generalization for seq2seq text generation models. The gains are demonstrated on multiple text gen tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:This paper proposes a contrastive learning framework called CLAPS that generates adversarial positive and negative examples to train sequence-to-sequence models, improving their generalization by exposing them to varied valid and incorrect outputs during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in conditional text generation:- The paper tackles the problem of exposure bias in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for conditional text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question generation. Exposure bias refers to the fact that seq2seq models are typically trained only on ground truth sequences using teacher forcing, and are not exposed to their own incorrectly generated sequences during training. This is a well-known issue that hurts generalization.- The paper proposes a contrastive learning approach to address exposure bias, by training the model to distinguish between positive input-output pairs and negative pairs constructed using adversarial perturbations. Using adversarial examples as negatives is novel compared to prior contrastive learning methods that use random non-targets.- The proposed method of generating "hard" positive and negative pairs using adversarial perturbations is principled and avoids the issues with naive negative sampling. This approach to constructing meaningful contrastive examples seems unique to this paper. - The overall framework of contrastive learning for seq2seq is not entirely new, with some prior works like [CITATION] also exploring it. However, the adversarial perturbation approach makes the contrasts more meaningful.- For conditional text generation tasks specifically, other methods to address exposure bias include reinforcement learning, scheduled sampling, GANs etc. The contrastive learning viewpoint is relatively less explored for these problems.- The paper demonstrates strong empirical performance from the proposed techniques on multiple text gen tasks. The gains over baselines are quite significant.- The method seems generic enough to extend to other seq2seq domains like speech, vision etc. The adversarial construction of positives/negatives is also a domain-agnostic framework applicable beyond text.In summary, the paper introduces a new perspective on exposure bias through contrastive learning, and makes useful innovations in constructing meaningful contrasts using adversarial perturbations. The gains demonstrated over text generation baselines validate the utility of the approach. It compares favorably to prior attempts at tackling exposure bias.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring contrastive learning for sequence-to-sequence models on other domains like speech, vision, etc. The authors mention their method may be applicable to tasks like automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and video captioning. - Developing better methods for generating positive and negative examples. The authors mention their approach for constructing hard positive and negative pairs is a "principled method" but suggest there may be room for improvement.- Applying contrastive learning more broadly to other conditional text generation tasks. The authors demonstrate their method on machine translation, summarization, and question generation, but suggest it could likely benefit other text generation problems as well.- Investigating whether contrastive learning can help with semi-supervised or few-shot learning settings. The authors focus on standard supervised learning but contrastive methods have shown promise in low-resource regimes too.- Extending contrastive learning for open-ended text generation. The tasks explored are conditional generation, suggesting exploration of unconstrained text generation.- Developing complementary training objectives to contrastive learning. Combining contrastive methods with goals like smoothing the generator distribution could further improve quality.In summary, the main future directions relate to applying contrastive learning more broadly across domains, tasks, and settings to further improve sequence-to-sequence learning. The authors provide a solid foundation and suggest several promising paths for follow-up research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a method called CLAPS (Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Seq2seq learning) to improve conditional text generation models like sequence-to-sequence models. The key idea is to use contrastive learning to train the model to distinguish between valid input-output pairs and invalid ones. However, randomly sampling negative examples from the batch is ineffective, especially for large pretrained models. So the authors propose to automatically generate "hard" positive and negative pairs - the negative examples are generated by adding small perturbations to the target sequence to minimize its likelihood under the model, while positive examples are generated with large perturbations but enforcing the likelihood to remain high. The contrastive learning with such hard examples helps the model better distinguish between valid and invalid outputs and improves generalization. Experiments on machine translation, summarization and question generation tasks show the proposed method CLAPS outperforms baselines.
