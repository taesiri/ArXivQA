# [CO-Fun: A German Dataset on Company Outsourcing in Fund Prospectuses for   Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15322)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cyber incidents like data breaches pose risks to financial stability as financial entities increasingly outsource services and processes to IT providers. 
- To discover such cyber risks, "cyber mapping" is a useful process which links the financial network (banks, funds, insurance companies) to the cyber network (cloud services, data centers, software providers).
- To perform cyber mapping, evidences of outsourced services and relationships between financial and IT entities are needed. 
- Publicly available German fund prospectuses mention outsourced services and companies, but structured information needs to be extracted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- However, no suitable German dataset exists to train NLP models for named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) focused on the financial domain.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors build a new dataset called CO-Fun by extracting relevant sentences from 1054 German fund prospectuses. 
- 948 sentences were annotated by experts with 5969 named entities and 4102 relations. Entity types: Outsourcing, Company, Location, Software. Relations: Outsourcing-Company, Company-Location.
- The dataset was anonymized and made publicly available. 
- The authors experiment with conditional random fields (CRF) and BERT models for NER, and a RoBERTa model for RE.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of the novel CO-Fun dataset to support cyber mapping in the financial domain using NLP techniques.
- The dataset contains realistic German sentences from fund prospectuses with ground truth labels for four entity types and two relations. 
- Promising NER results were achieved with CRF (F1 94.3%) and BERT (F1 92.2%). The RoBERTa model reached 86.3% F1 for relation extraction.
- The anonymized dataset, guidelines and code were published to support further research.

In summary, this paper presented the new CO-Fun dataset to advance NLP techniques for cyber mapping in the financial domain by providing a realistic corpus with ground truth labels for training and evaluating models. First experiments showcase the potential of this data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces CO-Fun, a new German dataset for named entity recognition and relation extraction focused on company outsourcing mentions in fund prospectuses, consisting of 948 sentences with 5,969 entity and 4,102 relation annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of a new German dataset called CO-Fun for named entity recognition and relation extraction, specifically focused on company outsourcing mentions in fund prospectuses. The key highlights of the dataset are:

- It contains 948 sentences with 5,969 named entity annotations and 4,102 relation annotations. The entities include Outsourced Services, Companies, Locations and Software. The relations are Outsourcing-Company and Company-Location.

- The data was annotated by experts from the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Federal Bank) based on a collection of 1,054 real fund prospectuses. 

- The dataset fills a gap for German NLP resources focused on the financial domain and cyber mapping of outsourcing relationships.

- Experiments with state-of-the-art NER and RE models show promising initial results on the new dataset. An anonymized version is publicly released to encourage further research.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction and release of a new expert-annotated German dataset to support named entity recognition, relation extraction and cyber mapping research on the financial domain.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that cyber mapping is a conceptual method to discover cyber risks by linking the financial network with the cyber network. Can you expand more on how this conceptual method works and what are the challenges in implementing it?

2. The paper collects evidence for cyber mapping from fund prospectuses. Why are fund prospectuses a good source for hints on outsourced services and companies in the financial domain? What other potential sources could be leveraged?

3. The paper uses a GUI for annotating sentences with named entities and relations. What are some advantages and disadvantages of using a GUI compared to other annotation methods? How could the annotation process be improved? 

4. The paper has 3 experts independently annotate the sentences without considering inter-annotator agreement. How important is measuring agreement between annotators? What methods could be used to quantify and improve agreement?

5. The paper uses conditional random fields (CRF) and BERT for named entity recognition. What are the key differences between these two methods? What are their relative strengths and weaknesses? 

6. The paper fine-tunes RoBERTa, an optimized BERT model, for relation extraction. What optimizations does RoBERTa introduce over BERT? Why are these optimizations beneficial?

7. Both CRF and BERT face overfitting issues as evident from lower test scores. What techniques could be used to reduce overfitting of these models? 

8. The anonymization process replaces company names with random companies from a database. Does this impact the utility of the dataset? How else could sensitive information be protected?

9. The paper shows promising initial results, but there is scope for improvement. What additional data could be incorporated to boost model performance further? 

10. The paper focuses only on 2 relations - Outsourcing-Company and Company-Location. What other meaningful relations exist in this domain that could be targeted by relation extraction?
