# [Understanding and Patching Compositional Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14328)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown failures in compositional reasoning, i.e. combining multiple steps of reasoning, despite success on individual reasoning steps. This is evidenced by high error rates on multi-hop question answering using knowledge even when the LLM can answer the individual sub-questions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors analyzed compositional reasoning failures and found they stem from LLM's inability to properly generate or leverage implicit reasoning results in the intermediate layers.

- Experiments using Logit Lens showed that though implicit results do manifest in middle layers, they are not intense or timely enough to propagate to explicit results. 

- Intervention experiments provided evidence that emergence of implicit reasoning has a causative effect on explicit reasoning.

- Key multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules were located using causal mediation analysis which are critical for producing and using implicit reasoning results.

- A model editing method called CREME was proposed to edit the located MHSA modules using the reference computation graph of the second sub-question. This allows correcting errors by integrating correct intermediate results.


Main Contributions:

- Identified root causes of compositional reasoning failures in LLMs to be inability to properly generate or leverage implicit reasoning results

- Showed causative effect of implicit reasoning results on final explicit results

- Located key MHSA modules responsible for implicit reasoning generation and usage

- Developed CREME, a model editing technique to correct compositional reasoning failures by editing located modules, which shows strong performance on correcting, paraphrasing and generalization.

In summary, the root causes of compositional reasoning failures were uncovered and a effective lightweight editing method called CREME was proposed to alleviate such failures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the causes of compositional reasoning failures in large language models, locates key modules responsible for properly generating intermediate reasoning results, and develops a method to edit those modules to correct reasoning errors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Successfully demonstrating that compositional reasoning within large language models (LLMs) relies critically on the model's ability to generate and leverage implicit reasoning results. 

2) Pinpointing specific multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules within intermediary layers of the LLM that play an instrumental role in properly generating and leveraging these implicit reasoning results.

3) Developing CREME, a light-weight model editing method that is able to effectively patch errors in the compositional reasoning capability of LLMs by editing the parameters of the located MHSA modules. Empirical results validate CREME's effectiveness.

In summary, the key contribution is gaining an in-depth understanding into the root causes behind failures in the compositional reasoning capability of LLMs, locating the specific components responsible, and leveraging these insights to develop a targeted editing approach to enhance compositional reasoning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Compositional reasoning - The paper focuses on analyzing and improving the compositional reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). This refers to the ability to break down and solve complex reasoning tasks in a step-by-step manner.

- Implicit/explicit reasoning results - The paper finds that failures in compositional reasoning for LLMs often stem from issues with generating or leveraging implicit reasoning results, which are intermediate conclusions that enable the model to reach the final, explicit reasoning result.  

- Multi-head self-attention (MHSA) - The paper locates MHSA modules within middle layers of LLMs as being critical for properly generating and using implicit reasoning results during compositional reasoning.

- Logit Lens - This is a technique used throughout the paper to interpret the information contained in the inner hidden states of LLMs by projecting them into the output vocabulary space.

- Intervention analysis - The paper applies intervention analysis on LLMs' inner states to provide evidence that implicit reasoning results play a causal role in explicit reasoning results. 

- Model editing - The proposed CREME method corrects failures in compositional reasoning by editing the parameters of the located MHSA modules, viewing them as a linear associative memory.

In summary, key concepts include compositional reasoning, the role of implicit/explicit results, using techniques like Logit Lens and interventions to analyze model behavior, and editing MHSA modules to improve compositional reasoning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called CREME for patching compositional reasoning errors in large language models (LLMs). Can you provide more details on the algorithm behind CREME and how it edits the parameters of the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules? 

2. The key insight from your analysis is that failures in compositional reasoning stem from LLMs not properly generating or leveraging implicit reasoning results. Can you expand more on why this is the case? What specifically goes wrong in the LLM's reasoning process?

3. You identified the MHSA modules in middle layers of the LLM as being important for generating implicit reasoning results. Why do you think MHSA is more critical for this compared to other components like the MLP? 

4. The editing in CREME is done by inserting a new (key, value) pair into the MHSA module's memory. Walk me through how you derive the mathematical update rule to minimize disruption to existing memories.

5. You evaluate CREME on paraphrasing and generalization tasks in addition to the original queries. Why is performance on these tasks an important indicator of CREME's efficacy? What specifically do they tell us?

6. Could you discuss any limitations of the datasets or LLMs used in your experiments? Do you expect the conclusions to transfer to much larger models like GPT-3 and PaLM?

7. The paper talks about "striking a nuanced balance" in CREME's editing objective. Can you expand more on this concept of balance and why it is important when editing model parameters?

8. How does CREME compare to other related works like Memory Injection and PatchScopes? What are some key advantages of your approach over prior arts? 

9. An interesting finding is that CREME also improves compositional reasoning for queries sharing the first-hop knowledge. Why do you think editing the MHSA has this cross-task generalization effect?

10. The idea of continuously self-correcting and self-improving LLMs over time is intriguing but raises concerns about model stability. How might CREME account for this in a deployed setting?
