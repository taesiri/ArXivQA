# [FastInst: A Simple Query-Based Model for Real-Time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08594)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to design an efficient real-time instance segmentation model based on the query-based framework. 

The key hypothesis is that with proper designs, the query-based model can achieve strong performance on instance segmentation while maintaining fast speed, surpassing previous convolutional network-based real-time methods.

Specifically, the paper proposes to:

1. Use instance activation-guided queries instead of learned queries to provide rich information about potential objects and reduce decoder query iterations. 

2. Adopt a dual-path update strategy to enhance pixel features and reduce reliance on heavy pixel decoders and number of decoder layers.

3. Introduce ground truth mask-guided learning to improve the performance of masked attention in the decoder.

Through these designs, the paper aims to demonstrate the potential of query-based models for real-time instance segmentation and promote their development. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and show state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes FastInst, a simple and effective query-based framework for real-time instance segmentation. 

2. It introduces three key techniques to improve the efficiency of query-based instance segmentation models:

- Instance activation-guided queries: Selects representative pixel embeddings as queries to reduce the query refinement burden. 

- Dual-path update strategy: Alternately updates pixel features and queries for better feature representations.

- Ground truth mask-guided learning: Uses GT masks in masked attention to improve training.

3. Experiments show FastInst achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed trade-off on COCO, outperforming previous real-time instance segmentation methods. 

4. The paper demonstrates the potential of query-based models for efficient instance segmentation, establishing a new strong baseline for real-time instance segmentation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing FastInst, an efficient query-based framework for real-time instance segmentation, with several technical innovations to improve model efficiency. The experiments validate its state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
