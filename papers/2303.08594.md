# [FastInst: A Simple Query-Based Model for Real-Time Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08594)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question is how to design an efficient real-time instance segmentation model based on the query-based framework. 

The key hypothesis is that with proper designs, the query-based model can achieve strong performance on instance segmentation while maintaining fast speed, surpassing previous convolutional network-based real-time methods.

Specifically, the paper proposes to:

1. Use instance activation-guided queries instead of learned queries to provide rich information about potential objects and reduce decoder query iterations. 

2. Adopt a dual-path update strategy to enhance pixel features and reduce reliance on heavy pixel decoders and number of decoder layers.

3. Introduce ground truth mask-guided learning to improve the performance of masked attention in the decoder.

Through these designs, the paper aims to demonstrate the potential of query-based models for real-time instance segmentation and promote their development. The experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and show state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and speed.
