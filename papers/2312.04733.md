## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of neighboring extremal optimal control (NEOC) for closed-loop systems, where the goal is to determine how small variations in system parameters impact the optimal control law. 
- Most prior work has focused on open-loop optimal control problems and uses second-variation theory to handle perturbations. This paper aims to address closed-loop systems where the nominal solution is a feedback control law obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes determining how the optimal cost function $\phi$ changes with parameters by taking its derivative w.r.t. parameters. This allows computing an adjustment term to the nominal feedback law to obtain a NEOC law.
- The adjustment term can be formally obtained by solving a linear partial differential equation, but a numerical approach based on the Galerkin method for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations is proposed. 
- This converts the NEOC problem into solving a simple set of linear equations to compute the weighting coefficients of basis functions representing $\phi$, eliminating the need to fully re-solve the optimal control problem.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a theoretical framework and analysis to obtain NEOC solutions for closed-loop optimal control problems with parameter variations.
- Proposes an efficient numerical algorithm leveraging Galerkin methods to solve for NEOC adjustments by solving linear equations.
- Demonstrates the approach on various examples including LQR systems where it simplifies to solving linear equations.
- Provides stability analysis to show the NEOC law maintains local exponential stability. 
- Derives error bounds between the NEOC law and true optimal control law after perturbations.
- Proposes a homotopic approach to handle larger parameter variations by incrementally updating the NEOC solution.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework to efficiently compute adjustments to closed-loop optimal controllers under parameter uncertainties, with demonstrated effectiveness on various problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces an approach to obtain a neighboring extremal optimal control solution for closed-loop optimal control problems with parameter variations by investigating the variation incurred in the functional form of a known closed-loop optimal control law.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an approach to obtain a neighboring extremal optimal control (NEOC) solution for a closed-loop optimal control problem when there are small known variations in the system parameters or performance index. Specifically:

- The paper derives a formula to calculate the adjustment needed to a known closed-loop optimal control law in order to maintain near-optimal performance when parameters change slightly. This avoids having to fully re-solve the optimal control problem.

- A numerical algorithm based on the Galerkin method is proposed to actually compute the NEOC solution. This transforms the problem into solving a simple set of linear equations.

- Theoretical analysis is provided on things like: the recursive algorithm's ability to maintain admissible behavior; the stability guarantee of the NEOC law; and the error bounds between the NEOC law and true optimal law after parameters change.

- A homotopic approach is introduced to handle larger parameter variations by breaking the adjustment down into multiple small steps.

- Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the NEOC approach on various examples, including a linear quadratic regulator, nonlinear scalar system, bilinear system, and inverted pendulum system.

So in summary, the main novelty is in adapting the concept of neighboring extremal optimal control to closed-loop instead of open-loop problems, providing a way to efficiently recalculate the feedback control law after small parameter changes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this research include:

- Neighboring extremal optimal control (NEOC): The overall concept of adjusting an optimal control law to maintain near-optimal performance under small parameter variations.

- Closed-loop optimal control: The paper focuses on optimal control laws that are in feedback (closed-loop) form rather than open-loop.

- Hamilton-Jacobi equation: The nonlinear partial differential equation governing the optimal control problem. Its solution provides the optimal feedback law.

- Iterative algorithms: Approaches like the Galerkin method that solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation through a sequence of linear approximations. 

- Perturbations/variations in parameters: Small changes in parameters of the optimal control problem, such as in the system dynamics or cost function. The goal is to efficiently update the control for these.

- Stability: Analyzing the stability guarantees for the neighboring extremal control law.

- Basis functions: Used to numerically approximate the solution in the Galerkin algorithm.

- Homotopy: A technique to break down a large parameter variation into multiple smaller steps to maintain accuracy.

So in summary, the core ideas relate to adjusting closed-loop optimal controls, using concepts from Hamilton-Jacobi equations, perturbations, numerical methods, stability analysis, and homotopy theory.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using the method for differential games in the future work section. Can you explain how the NEOC framework would need to be modified to handle a minimax optimization problem instead of just a minimization problem? 

2. The paper establishes local exponential stability for the optimal control law. Can you walk through the proof and explain the key steps that allow concluding exponential stability? What assumptions are critical?

3. How exactly does the use of the Galerkin method allow transforming the NEOC problem into a simpler linear equation? Explain the key steps in going from the partial differential equation to the set of linear equations. 

4. The paper mentions "online algorithms" as future work. Can you explain what challenges exist in developing an online NEOC algorithm compared to the offline method proposed?

5. What are some examples of systems where the homotopic approach may fail due to discontinuities in the optimal control law with respect to parameters? Explain why discontinuities can occur.

6. One of the future work items mentions rise time versus overshoot tradeoff. Can you explain how the NEOC framework could help tackle this classical control problem? 

7. What are the key differences in assumptions between the NEOC problem formulation here and the classical neighboring extremal methods that start with open-loop optimal control?

8. The paper frequently uses the terminology "new" and "original" optimal control problems. Explain in detail what constitutes the new and original problems. 

9. What difficulties can arise in adaptive control if the NEOC adjustments to parameters are too large between iterations? Explain why instability is possible.

10. The paper mentions more complex performance indices in the future work. What additional challenges arise if the performance index has cross terms between states and control instead of the separable form used here?
