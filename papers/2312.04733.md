# [Neighboring Extremal Optimal Control Theory for Parameter-Dependent   Closed-loop Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04733)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper addresses the problem of neighboring extremal optimal control (NEOC) for closed-loop systems, where the goal is to determine how small variations in system parameters impact the optimal control law. 
- Most prior work has focused on open-loop optimal control problems and uses second-variation theory to handle perturbations. This paper aims to address closed-loop systems where the nominal solution is a feedback control law obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes determining how the optimal cost function $\phi$ changes with parameters by taking its derivative w.r.t. parameters. This allows computing an adjustment term to the nominal feedback law to obtain a NEOC law.
- The adjustment term can be formally obtained by solving a linear partial differential equation, but a numerical approach based on the Galerkin method for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations is proposed. 
- This converts the NEOC problem into solving a simple set of linear equations to compute the weighting coefficients of basis functions representing $\phi$, eliminating the need to fully re-solve the optimal control problem.

Main Contributions:
- Provides a theoretical framework and analysis to obtain NEOC solutions for closed-loop optimal control problems with parameter variations.
- Proposes an efficient numerical algorithm leveraging Galerkin methods to solve for NEOC adjustments by solving linear equations.
- Demonstrates the approach on various examples including LQR systems where it simplifies to solving linear equations.
- Provides stability analysis to show the NEOC law maintains local exponential stability. 
- Derives error bounds between the NEOC law and true optimal control law after perturbations.
- Proposes a homotopic approach to handle larger parameter variations by incrementally updating the NEOC solution.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive theoretical and computational framework to efficiently compute adjustments to closed-loop optimal controllers under parameter uncertainties, with demonstrated effectiveness on various problems.
