# [Toward Verifiable and Reproducible Human Evaluation for Text-to-Image   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01816)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions and hypotheses of this paper are:

1. Current practices of human evaluation for text-to-image generation are problematic and lack reliability and transparency. The authors survey recent papers and find inconsistencies in evaluation protocols, omitted experimental details, and questionable practices like small sample sizes. 

2. Automatic evaluation metrics like FID and CLIPScore are insufficient to represent human perception of image quality and text-image alignment. The authors hypothesize that these metrics are inconsistent with human evaluation.

3. A standardized and well-defined human evaluation protocol is needed to facilitate reliable and reproducible evaluation of text-to-image models. The authors propose and validate such a protocol using crowdsourcing.

4. The proposed human evaluation protocol can reveal limitations of current text-to-image models that are not exposed by automatic metrics. The authors hypothesize that their protocol will show discrepancies between human ratings and automatic measures.

5. Sharing code and data resources from standardized human evaluation will benefit the research community. The authors aim to provide implementations, reporting templates, and human ratings to facilitate adoption of better practices.

In summary, the core goals are to demonstrate issues with current human evaluation practices, propose and validate a better standardized protocol, show its ability to reveal limitations of automatic metrics, and provide resources to facilitate improved evaluation in future text-to-image generation research.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- They survey 37 recent text-to-image generation papers and find that current practices of human evaluation have issues with reliability and transparency. For example, evaluation protocols vary significantly between papers, important details like the number of ratings per sample are often omitted, and annotation quality is rarely assessed.

- They propose a standardized human evaluation protocol for text-to-image generation to address these issues. The protocol uses crowdsourcing and is designed to be simple and produce interpretable results.

- They evaluate several state-of-the-art generative models with their protocol and analyze the collected ratings. The results reveal limitations of commonly used automatic measures like FID and CLIPScore.

- They provide recommendations for conducting reliable human evaluations, like reporting details of the experimental configuration and understanding crowdworker behavior. 

- They make several resources available including an implementation of their protocol, a template for reporting results, and human ratings for several datasets. This is aimed at facilitating reproducible and transparent human evaluation.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a standardized protocol to enable more rigorous human evaluation for text-to-image generation, along with an empirical analysis that demonstrates the need for such protocols and resources to support their adoption. The paper aims to improve the verifiability and reproducibility of human evaluation in this field.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other research in text-to-image generation:

- It provides a comprehensive review of human evaluation practices in recent text-to-image papers, identifying issues with reliability and transparency. Many papers rely solely on automatic measures or use poorly described human evaluation protocols. The review is quite thorough in documenting the current state of human evaluation.

- The paper proposes a standardized human evaluation protocol using crowdsourcing to facilitate better reproducibility and verifiability. The protocol is designed based on principles of simplicity and interpretability. Details like rating formats, evaluation criteria, qualifications, instructions etc. are carefully considered.

- The proposed protocol is validated through pilot experiments and data collection. Different aspects like the impact of question wording, qualification requirements, number of prompts and raters are analyzed. This provides useful insights into protocol design choices.

- Several existing text-to-image models are evaluated on datasets using the standardized protocol. Misalignment between automatic metrics like FID and human judgments is demonstrated. The collected human annotations and analysis provide a valuable benchmark and resource.

- The work focuses specifically on the evaluation of text-to-image models using natural language descriptions. Other modalities like artwork generation may need different criteria. The scope is narrower compared to general image generation evaluation.

- In contrast to many existing papers, this work places emphasis on proper experimental design, transparent reporting and analysis of human evaluation. The code, data and reporting template are open-sourced to facilitate adoption.

Overall, the systematic treatment of human evaluation is a key distinguishing factor compared to most prior text-to-image papers. The standardized protocol and analysis help advance best practices for reliable and reproducible human evaluation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing evaluation protocols to assess potential biases in generated images. The paper notes that evaluating aspects like fairness and bias is important for many applications, but they only focused on fidelity and alignment in their human evaluation protocol.

- Extending the evaluation to other domains beyond natural images, such as artwork. The criteria for evaluating things like aesthetics and creativity may be different.

- Improving the reliability of low-budget experiments by using statistical significance tests and effect size measures when sample sizes are small. The authors suggest this as a way to avoid unreliable conclusions with limited human evaluation data.

- Considering alternative aggregation methods for human ratings beyond simply averaging, in order to account for annotator biases. The authors observe some annotator biases in their collected ratings.

- Using sampling techniques to estimate model performance more efficiently with fewer human evaluation samples. Collecting enough annotations for reliable conclusions remains expensive.

- Developing better automatic evaluation measures that align with human judgments, since the commonly used FID and CLIPScore measures have limitations. Updating automatic measures to catch up with evolving generative models is noted as important.

- Sharing more resources like code for human evaluation interfaces to enable continuous improvement of protocols. The lack of reusable resources is noted as an issue.

So in summary, the authors point to directions like improving evaluation efficiency, developing better automatic and human measures, accounting for biases, and increasing transparency through shared resources. Advancing evaluation practices for text-to-image generation seems like a central theme.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a standardized and well-defined human evaluation protocol for text-to-image generation to facilitate verifiable and reproducible evaluation. The authors survey 37 recent papers and find that many rely solely on automatic measures like FID or perform poorly described human evaluations lacking details. To address this, they design a simple crowdsourced evaluation protocol assessing image fidelity and text-image alignment. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal discrepancies between automatic measures and human perception. The FID is inconsistent with humans and CLIPScore is saturated, unable to discriminate real and generated images. Sample size analyses provide insights into designing reliable human evaluation experiments. The authors share code and data to facilitate adoption of their standardized protocol, aiming to enhance the reliability and transparency of human evaluation practices in this field.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a standardized human evaluation protocol to facilitate verifiable and reproducible human evaluation for text-to-image generation. The authors first surveyed 37 recent papers and found that current human evaluation practices have issues with reliability and transparency, with inconsistent protocols and lack of details on experimental setup. To address this, they carefully design an evaluation protocol using crowdsourcing and validate it empirically. The protocol uses absolute scoring on two criteria - fidelity and alignment to text prompt - with carefully designed instructions and qualifications for crowdworkers. 

Experiments with the protocol on COCO, DrawBench and PartiPrompts datasets reveal limitations of current automated measures like FID and CLIPScore in correlating with human perception. The paper provides recommendations for reliable crowdsourced evaluation like sufficient sample sizes, reporting details for transparency, and understanding crowdworker behavior. The authors open source resources like implementation code, reporting templates and collected human ratings to facilitate adoption of the standardized protocol for more reliable human evaluation. Key findings are that prior human evaluation reliability is questionable, FID is inconsistent with human perception, and CLIPScore is saturated and insufficient to discriminate state-of-the-art models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a standardized human evaluation protocol to facilitate verifiable and reproducible human evaluation of text-to-image generation models. The authors design a simple crowdsourcing-based evaluation task with absolute rating on a 5-point Likert scale for two criteria - fidelity and alignment. They carefully design the task instructions, qualification requirements, and compensation to ensure high-quality annotations. The number of prompts and raters per sample are analyzed to determine sufficient sample sizes. The authors evaluate several existing models with their protocol on COCO, DrawBench and PartiPrompts datasets. They provide detailed analysis of the human ratings and compare them with automatic measures like FID and CLIPScore. The results reveal inconsistencies of automatic measures with human perception. The authors argue that the standardized protocol enables reliable human evaluation and share their implementation to facilitate adoption.
