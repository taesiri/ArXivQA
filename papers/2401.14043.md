# [Towards Goal-oriented Large Language Model Prompting: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown strong performance on various downstream tasks when prompted appropriately. However, their effectiveness relies heavily on the prompting strategy used. 
- Existing prompting methods often hold an unrealistic anthropomorphic assumption that LLMs can decompose complex problems like humans. This leads to unsatisfactory performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes adopting a goal-oriented prompting strategy that guides LLMs to mimic human logical thinking and problem solving processes. 
- A novel taxonomy is introduced that categorizes goal-oriented prompting methods into 5 key stages:
   1. Goal decomposition into sub-goal sequences
   2. Action selection for attaining sub-goals  
   3. Action implementation to get sub-goal results
   4. Evaluation of sub-goal achievement
   5. Selection of valuable sub-goals
- The framework demonstrates how human-interpretable prompts can be constructed to lead LLMs through methodical and logical reasoning to solve tasks effectively.

Main Contributions:
- First taxonomy of goal-oriented prompting strategies that structures existing works into 5 interconnected stages.
- Literature review of 35 representative studies validating that goal-oriented prompts significantly improve LLM performance over anthropomorphic assumptions.
- Demonstration of framework's broad applicability to tasks like reasoning, planning, QA, dialogue by summarizing 10 applicable tasks. 
- Proposal of 4 future directions:
   1. Synergy of the 5 framework stages
   2. Applying framework to more tasks 
   3. Addressing efficiency concerns
   4. Hierarchical decomposition of sub-goals

Overall, the paper emphasizes and promotes goal-oriented prompt engineering through a structured framework to optimize LLM performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a goal-oriented taxonomy for large language model prompting that guides models to follow established human logical thinking, categorized into 5 interconnected stages: goal decomposition, action selection, action implementation, sub-goal evaluation, and valuable sub-goal selection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the first goal-oriented taxonomy of prompting methods. Specifically, it categorizes goal-oriented prompting methods into five interconnected stages: 

1) Goal decomposition: Breaking down the main goal into more manageable sub-goals.

2) Action selection: Choosing the most effective and valid actions to reach the sub-goals. 

3) Action implementation: Implementing the selected actions to achieve the sub-goals.

4) Sub-goal result evaluation: Evaluating whether the sub-goals are achieved based on the results.

5) Sub-goal selection: Selecting the most valuable sub-goals for effective overall goal achievement.

The paper demonstrates the broad applicability of this goal-oriented framework by summarizing how it has been applied to a wide variety of tasks like reasoning, planning, question answering, dialogue, etc. It also discusses challenges and future opportunities to further improve goal-oriented prompt engineering. Overall, the key contribution is proposing this novel taxonomy to categorize and guide research on goal-oriented prompting methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a taxonomy with 5 stages for goal-oriented prompting. Could you expand more on the connections and interactions between these stages? For example, how can the sub-goal evaluation stage inform the sub-goal selection stage?

2. The paper mentions combining external tools with LLMs for some stages like action implementation. What are some challenges in effectively integrating external modules with LLMs in a seamless manner? How can prompt engineering help bridge the gap? 

3. For the sub-goal selection stage, the paper discusses chain/tree/graph-based approaches. What are some limitations of these approaches and how can they be improved? Are there other structured representations that could be more effective?

4. The application section provides a good high-level overview. Can you provide more specifics on how the goal-oriented prompting framework was customized and instantiated for some sample applications like reasoning, planning etc? 

5. The paper focuses mainly on accuracy. Can you discuss how the goal-oriented prompting framework can help improve other metrics like efficiency, coherence, human-interpretability etc?

6. Hierarchical decomposition of sub-goals is briefly mentioned at the end. Can you expand more on this concept? What are some ways it can be realized within the goal-oriented prompting framework?

7. What are some ways the self-evaluation strategies of LLMs can be improved? Can external human feedback be incorporated to make self-evaluations more robust?

8. For virtual environments like games, can you discuss how simulated user interactions and dialog can be incorporated within the goal-oriented prompting framework?

9. What are some promising ways goal-oriented prompting can be applied to real-world robotic applications? What are the open challenges?

10. The paper focuses on prompting large language models. How can the concepts be extended to other AI systems for goal-oriented behavior beyond just language?
