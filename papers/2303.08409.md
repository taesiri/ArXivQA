# [Lana: A Language-Capable Navigator for Instruction Following and   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08409)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we learn a single agent that is capable of both navigation instruction following and route description creation?

The key hypothesis is that by simultaneously learning instruction grounding (following) and generation in a unified framework, a single agent can achieve strong performance on both tasks.

Specifically, this paper proposes LANA, a language-capable navigation agent that can not only execute human-written navigation commands but also provide grounded route descriptions. LANA has a multi-task learning framework that exploits commonalities and differences between the instruction following and generation tasks, allowing knowledge transfer between the two. 

The experiments empirically verify that compared to recent specialized solutions, LANA achieves better performance on both tasks using a single model. The joint training also leads to improved efficiency and interpretability. Overall, this work represents an early attempt at building an interpretable and socially intelligent embodied navigation agent.
