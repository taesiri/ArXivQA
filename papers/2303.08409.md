# [Lana: A Language-Capable Navigator for Instruction Following and   Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08409)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

Can we learn a single agent that is capable of both navigation instruction following and route description creation?

The key hypothesis is that by simultaneously learning instruction grounding (following) and generation in a unified framework, a single agent can achieve strong performance on both tasks.

Specifically, this paper proposes LANA, a language-capable navigation agent that can not only execute human-written navigation commands but also provide grounded route descriptions. LANA has a multi-task learning framework that exploits commonalities and differences between the instruction following and generation tasks, allowing knowledge transfer between the two. 

The experiments empirically verify that compared to recent specialized solutions, LANA achieves better performance on both tasks using a single model. The joint training also leads to improved efficiency and interpretability. Overall, this work represents an early attempt at building an interpretable and socially intelligent embodied navigation agent.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents Lana, a language-capable navigation agent that can both follow navigation instructions and generate descriptions of navigation routes. The key contributions are:

1. Lana is a single model that masters both instruction following and generation, without needing to switch between separate models for each task. 

2. Lana achieves strong performance on both tasks, comparable or better than prior state-of-the-art task-specific models, with a more elegant and efficient architecture.

3. By jointly training on instruction following and generation, Lana better captures cross-task knowledge and linguistic/visual/action relationships.

4. Lana can generate high-quality route descriptions to interpret its own behaviors, making it more explainable. This facilitates human-robot communication and collaboration.

5. Lana represents an early attempt towards building socially intelligent, language-capable robot navigation agents. It demonstrates the value of joint instruction following-generation modeling.

In summary, the key novelty is developing a single agent that can not only follow instructions but also describe routes, instead of separate specialized models. By training on both tasks jointly, Lana becomes more capable on each one. The interplay between instruction following and generation allows Lana to offer test-time explanations through linguistic route descriptions.
