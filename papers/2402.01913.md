# [TartanDrive 2.0: More Modalities and Better Infrastructure to Further   Self-Supervised Learning Research in Off-Road Driving Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
There is a lack of large-scale, multi-modal datasets for off-road driving tasks like perception, planning and control. Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity due to the challenges of collecting real-world off-road data. More data is needed to train advanced models like those based on self-supervised learning.

Solution:
The authors present TartanDrive 2.0, an expanded version of their previous off-road driving dataset TartanDrive. The new dataset has 7 hours of driving data collected with multiple sensors including cameras, LiDARs, IMU and others. It captures diverse terrain and lighting conditions at speeds up to 15m/s. The data collection infrastructure and tools are also released to encourage collaborative data aggregation.

Contributions:
- More sensors and 50% more driving data compared to previous version 
- Addition of 3 LiDAR sensors alongside existing cameras and other sensors
- Improved infrastructure and tools for processing, configuring and filtering the data
- Open-source data collection framework to enable collaborative data collection
- Data supports self-supervised learning for perception, planning and control
- Higher speed aggressive maneuvers represented compared to previous version

The new multi-modal dataset advances research in areas like cross-modal perception, map completion, ground height estimation, learning from demonstration and aggressive maneuver driving. Future work includes adding more sensors like thermal cameras, expanding to more sites and terrain types and incorporating vision-language tasks.
