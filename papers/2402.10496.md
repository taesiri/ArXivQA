# [Comparing Hallucination Detection Metrics for Multilingual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10496)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- There is limited understanding of how well automatic hallucination detection techniques perform on non-English languages. Prior work has focused predominantly on English texts. 
- It is unclear if methods developed for detecting hallucinations in English are effective or applicable in multilingual contexts.

Proposed Solution 
- Empirically evaluate different hallucination detection techniques on biographical text summaries generated by models in 19 languages.  
- Compare traditional lexical metrics like ROUGE and Named Entity Overlap against Natural Language Inference (NLI) metrics. Also evaluate reference-based metrics against consistency-based pairwise metrics.
- Present correlation analysis between automated metrics and human factuality verification at both sentence and atomic fact levels.

Key Findings
- Lexical overlap metrics do not correlate with NLI-based metrics in detecting factual hallucinations in both reference-free and reference-based settings.
- Pairwise NLI metrics strongly correlate with reference-based metrics in high-resource languages, but diminishes in low-resource languages.
- NLI metrics effectively identify sentence-level hallucinations in high-resource languages compared to human evaluation, but performance decreases for simpler atomic facts.

Main Contributions
- First empirical analysis evaluating effectiveness of hallucination detection techniques in multilingual setting, revealing limitations of current methods.
- Show that while traditional lexical and pairwise methods are more accessible in low-resource languages, they are often inadequate. 
- Underscore need for more robust hallucination detection methods in other languages, highlighting significant gap in current capabilities.
