# [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether large language models can effectively perform multi-step reasoning in a zero-shot setting, without any per-task prompt engineering or finetuning. Specifically, the paper investigates whether simply prefixing questions with a generic prompt like "Let's think step by step" can elicit logical reasoning and chains of thought from large language models. The key hypothesis seems to be that large language models have more capability for complex, multi-hop reasoning than previously believed, even in a zero-shot setting, and that this can be unlocked with a simple, task-independent prompting strategy. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis across a diverse set of reasoning tasks and benchmarks. Overall, the central research question revolves around assessing and unlocking the zero-shot reasoning potential of large language models through prompt engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a simple prefix prompt "Let's think step by step" that can elicit logical reasoning and multi-step problem solving from large language models in a zero-shot manner. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Showing that large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM exhibit decent zero-shot reasoning capabilities when prompted with "Let's think step by step" before answering questions. This allows them to generate plausible step-by-step reasoning chains to reach the correct answers.

- Demonstrating that this simple prompt works consistently across diverse reasoning tasks including arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning problems. This versatility indicates it is eliciting high-level, task-agnostic reasoning skills rather than narrow task-specific skills. 

- Comparing against strong baselines like few-shot prompting and showing large improvements in zero-shot reasoning performance. The scaling curves with model size for the zero-shot method also become comparable to few-shot prompting.

- Analyzing the sensitivity of few-shot vs zero-shot prompting, and arguing that the latter can reveal more unbiased capabilities of models without human biases from carefully curated examples.

- Broadly, providing new insights into the untapped zero-shot reasoning abilities hidden inside large pre-trained language models, which have been underestimated due to lack of exploration into task-generic prompts that elicit broad cognitive skills.

In summary, the main contribution is revealing and quantifying the stronger-than-expected zero-shot logical reasoning capabilities of large language models using a simple yet surprisingly versatile prompt.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective method for eliciting multi-step reasoning from large language models (LLMs) without any task-specific prompt engineering. Specifically, the authors show that just prompting the model with "Let's think step by step" before a question results in coherent chains of reasoning across diverse reasoning tasks. 

This differs from most prior work on improving reasoning in LLMs, which rely on task-specific prompt engineering or training, such as:

- Fine-tuning LLMs on datasets with step-by-step reasoning [1,2,3]. This requires expensive human annotation of reasoning processes.

- Using few-shot prompting with step-by-step reasoning demonstrations [4,5,6]. This also requires human engineering of reasoning prompts per task. 

- Designing reasoning templates and decompositions specifically for each task [7,8].

In contrast, the proposed method uses a simple fixed prompt to elicit complex multi-hop reasoning across tasks without any task-specific engineering. The versatility of the prompt hints at broad underlying reasoning capabilities in LLMs that can be extracted with the right prompt.

The most comparable work is [8], which also aims to facilitate multi-step reasoning from LLMs in a zero-shot manner. However, their approach requires substantial prompt engineering per task while the proposed approach uses a single fixed prompt for all tasks.

In summary, this work introduces a simple yet powerful prompt that unlocks multi-task reasoning abilities in LLMs without any task-specific engineering, contrasting prior prompting work that relies heavily on per-task prompt design and training. The findings highlight the efficacy of probing LLMs' reasoning skills through careful prompting.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated ways to extract the chain of thought reasoning from language models in a zero-shot manner, beyond just using the "Let's think step by step" prompt. The authors mention trying different prompt wording and structures to see their effect.

- Exploring other broad cognitive capabilities that could potentially be elicited from language models through careful prompting, beyond just logical reasoning. The authors suggest there may be additional high-level, task-agnostic knowledge hidden in the models that could be uncovered.

- Applying the zero-shot chain of thought prompting approach to more complex reasoning tasks and datasets, to further test its capabilities and limitations.

- Analyzing the differences between reasoning extracted via zero-shot prompting versus few-shot prompting more deeply, to understand the trade-offs and how they reflect the knowledge already inside the models.

- Using the zero-shot prompting as a tool to better analyze biases and capabilities of language models before any fine-tuning or few-shot prompting is applied.

- Developing better quantitative metrics and methods to evaluate the quality and correctness of the extracted reasoning chains, beyond just task accuracy.

- Combining zero-shot prompting with additional techniques like self-consistency ensembling to further improve multi-step reasoning.

In summary, the main future work revolves around better understanding and improving zero-shot prompting as a tool for extracting broad cognitive skills from language models, and using it as an analysis lens to study the models themselves in more depth. The simplicity yet effectiveness of the approach suggests there is still much more hidden potential to uncover.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel zero-shot prompting approach called Zero-shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) to elicit complex reasoning from large language models without requiring per-task prompt engineering. The key idea is to simply prepend the trigger prompt "Let's think step by step" before the question input. This generic prompt triggers the model to generate a step-by-step chain of reasoning before outputting the final answer. Unlike prior work on few-shot chain of thought prompting which requires careful prompt design with reasoning examples per task, the proposed method uses the same zero-shot prompt across diverse reasoning tasks. Experiments across arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense and logical reasoning datasets show significant gains over standard zero-shot prompting. The performance also scales better with model size. The simplicity and versatility of the fixed prompt across tasks indicates untapped zero-shot reasoning capabilities in large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my reading, the key questions and problems that this paper is addressing are:

1. How can we understand and enhance the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs)? Many recent works have shown that scaling up LLMs leads to major improvements in natural language tasks, but performance on logical reasoning tasks has remained limited. This paper aims to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

2. Can LLMs demonstrate strong multi-step reasoning skills in a zero-shot setting using simple prompting? Most prior work has focused on few-shot prompting with carefully designed reasoning examples. This paper investigates whether LLMs have untapped zero-shot reasoning skills that can be elicited through a simple prompt template. 

3. Is chain-of-thought prompting an inherent capability of LLMs rather than an artifact of few-shot learning? The chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting approach has shown impressive gains for LLMs on reasoning tasks. But it relies on few-shot examples, raising the question of whether the approach is capturing true reasoning skills versus exploiting the few-shot examples. This paper aims to answer this by reformulating CoT as a zero-shot prompt.

4. Can a single, task-agnostic prompt unlock logical reasoning across diverse tasks? Most prompting approaches are task-specific. This paper tests if a single fixed prompt can elicit multi-step reasoning across different types of logical reasoning tasks. 

5. What fundamental reasoning capabilities are "hidden" inside LLMs that can be extracted through careful probing? The authors suggest the strong zero-shot reasoning performance hints at high-level cognitive capabilities that exist within LLMs but require the right type of prompting to be revealed.

In summary, the key focus is understanding and improving the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs through zero-shot prompting, determining whether LLMs have inherent multi-step reasoning skills, and discovering the nature of their core reasoning capabilities. The paper challenges assumptions from prior work that depend on few-shot learning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the key points: 

The paper proposes a novel approach for eliciting step-by-step reasoning from large language models without needing task-specific examples. It introduces a simple template called "Let's think step by step" that can be prepended to questions to trigger chain of thought reasoning across diverse tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning.

The versatility of the single template hints at under-studied zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large LMs. The work highlights the importance of analyzing zero-shot knowledge in LLM before crafting per-task examples or prompts. It encourages more research into discovering task-agnostic, high-level cognitive capabilities via prompting.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Zero-shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) for eliciting complex multi-step reasoning from large language models (LLMs) through prompt engineering, without requiring any task-specific examples. The key idea is to simply insert a trigger phrase like "Let's think step by step" before the answer to encourage the LLM to provide an explanatory chain of reasoning leading to the final answer. Experiments across 12 diverse reasoning tasks show Zero-shot-CoT substantially outperforms standard zero-shot prompting, increasing accuracy from 10-20% to 40-80% on tasks like arithmetic and symbolic reasoning when using large models like InstructGPT and PaLM. The single prompt generalizes across very different reasoning domains, demonstrating strong fundamental multi-task reasoning capabilities exist already within LLMs without finetuning. The performance also scales better with model size compared to standard prompting. Overall, the work highlights the surprising versatility of a simple prompt to unlock complex unaided reasoning in LLMs, serving as a strong zero-shot baseline for the field, and encouraging more research into discovering multi-purpose abilities hidden in large pretrained models before specialized finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a simple generic prompting method called Zero-shot Chain of Thought that can elicit complex multi-step reasoning from large language models across diverse tasks in a zero-shot manner, challenging the notion that large language models are primarily few-shot learners.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 The paper introduces Zero-Shot-CoT, a simple zero-shot prompting method to elicit chain of thought reasoning from large language models across diverse reasoning tasks without requiring task-specific examples. It shows that by simply prompting "Let's think step by step" before each question, the reasoning and accuracy of LLMs like InstructGPT and PaLM improve significantly on arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning benchmarks compared to standard zero-shot prompting. For instance, on the MultiArith dataset, accuracy increases from 17.7% to 78.7% with InstructGPT. The method also shows better scaling compared to zero-shot as model size increases. The simplicity and consistency of improvements across very different reasoning tasks using a single fixed prompt hints at the untapped zero-shot reasoning capabilities hidden inside large LMs. While prior work emphasized few-shot learning for reasoning tasks, this paper suggests LLMs have more inherent multi-task, multi-step reasoning skills that can be uncovered through broader prompts, moving beyond narrow task-specific prompting. It serves as a strong zero-shot baseline and encourages exploring the broad cognitive capabilities of LLM's before crafting dataset-specific examples or prompts.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the paper "Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners":

1. The paper shows that large language models (LLMs) have decent zero-shot reasoning capabilities simply by adding the prompt "Let's think step by step" before each question. How robust is this approach to variations in the prompt wording or structure? Does performance decrease substantially if the prompt is changed?

2. The paper emphasizes eliciting reasoning chains or "chains of thought" (CoT) from LLMs in a zero-shot manner. However, the CoT examples generated still contain both reasoning errors and unnecessary steps. What could be done to improve the coherence and correctness of zero-shot CoT generation?

3. The authors highlight the versatility of their single prompt across diverse reasoning tasks. However, performance on commonsense reasoning tasks does not improve much. Why might this be the case? Are different prompting strategies needed for different reasoning skills?

4. The paper shows that scaling up model size leads to significant gains in zero-shot CoT performance, akin to the scaling for few-shot CoT prompting. Is there a limit to the returns of scale for zero-shot reasoning, or will progress continue with even larger models? 

5. The authors note that zero-shot CoT reasoning seems to avoid some of the limitations of few-shot CoT around sensitivity to example task mismatch. However, are there other pitfalls or limitations unique to the zero-shot approach?

6. The paper focuses on extracting reasoning chains, but does not evaluate whether the LLM's internal representations or knowledge are actually improved. Are there other metrics beyond answer accuracy that could better assess the impact of zero-shot CoT prompting?

7. The approach relies completely on a single hard-coded prompt for eliciting reasoning across all tasks. How could the method be extended to learn or infer optimal zero-shot prompts in a more dynamic, data-driven manner?

8. The authors use greedy decoding for generating CoT chains, but other decoding methods like beam search may further improve results. How robust is zero-shot CoT performance to different decoding algorithms?

9. Most results are on English language tasks, but could this zero-shot prompting approach work for non-English languages given a suitably trained multilingual LLM? How might performance differ?

10. The paper focuses on question answering tasks requiring reasoning. Could the approach apply effectively to other zero-shot settings like dialog, search queries, or open-ended generation? How might prompt design need to change?
