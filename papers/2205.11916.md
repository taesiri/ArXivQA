# [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 can demonstrate effective reasoning abilities in a zero-shot setting, without task-specific examples or prompts. The key hypothesis appears to be that LLMs contain untapped "dark knowledge" related to reasoning and logic that can be elicited through a simple, general prompt like "Let's think step by step" rather than requiring carefully engineered, task-specific prompts or demonstrations. The authors compare their proposed "Zero-shot Chain of Thought" (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting method against standard zero-shot prompting as well as few-shot prompting methods like "Chain of Thought" (CoT) prompting. Their goal is to show that Zero-shot-CoT can substantially improve reasoning performance across diverse tasks compared to standard zero-shot prompting, while approaching or exceeding the performance of few-shot methods without needing task-specific engineering.In summary, the central research question seems to be whether LLMs have strong latent zero-shot reasoning abilities that can be unlocked with a simple prompt, rather than needing task-specific examples or prompts. The hypothesis is that Zero-shot-CoT prompting can elicit this "logical dark knowledge" and significantly improve zero-shot reasoning performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Proposing a simple yet effective template-based prompt called "Zero-shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot-CoT)" that elicits reasoning chains from large language models in a zero-shot manner, without needing any per-task prompt engineering or reasoning examples.2. Showing that this single, fixed prompt facilitates multi-step reasoning and significantly improves the zero-shot reasoning capability of large LMs across diverse benchmark reasoning tasks, including arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning.3. Demonstrating that large LMs have untapped zero-shot reasoning capabilities that can be uncovered through careful prompting, rather than only being good few-shot reasoners as commonly believed. 4. Providing insights into the importance of analyzing the zero-shot knowledge already present in large LMs before crafting task-specific prompts or datasets.5. Introducing the notion of "logical dark knowledge" - the high-level, task-agnostic reasoning skills latent in LMs that can be extracted through prompts like Zero-shot-CoT.6. Establishing a strong zero-shot reasoning baseline that significantly outperforms prior work, serving as a minimal reference for future research into reasoning capabilities of large LMs.In summary, the key contribution is unveiling the surprisingly capable zero-shot reasoning skills of large LMs using a simple yet broadly effective prompt, and advocating for further research into extracting multi-task cognitive abilities from LMs. The proposed Zero-shot-CoT prompt establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning performance across multiple benchmark tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is an analysis of how the paper compares to other research in the same field:The paper presents a novel method for eliciting reasoning from large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, it shows that simply prompting LLMs with "Let's think step by step" before a question facilitates multi-step reasoning and substantially improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks. This differs from prior work in a few key ways:- Most prior work has focused on few-shot prompting, providing task-specific examples to guide the model's reasoning. This paper shows strong reasoning can be elicited zero-shot with a simple prompt.- Many prompting methods are task-specific. This paper shows a single prompt works across arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other reasoning tasks, suggesting it elicits broad cognitive capabilities.- Prior work emphasized LLMs as few-shot learners. This paper provides evidence that LLMs have untapped zero-shot reasoning potential, and carefully designed prompts can unlock it.- While most prompts target narrow skills, this prompt seems to elicit the broad ability of logical reasoning or "system 2" thinking.Overall, this paper introduces a simple but surprisingly effective method for zero-shot reasoning across diverse tasks. It highlights the promise of probing LLMs' reasoning in a general, task-agnostic way rather than relying on task-specific examples. The versatility of the prompt across many reasoning domains is novel and unlike prior specialized prompting work. The results suggest exciting potential for discovering task-general cognitive abilities in LLMs with careful prompting.In summary, this paper significantly advances the techniques for extracting reasoning from LLMs by showing it can be done zero-shot, in a general way across tasks, simply by prompting the models to "think step by step". The simplicity yet strong results are the major novel contribution compared to prior specialized prompting work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more advanced prompting techniques that can elicit even stronger reasoning abilities from large language models in a zero-shot manner. The authors showed promising results with a simple "Let's think step by step" prompt, but believe there is room for more sophisticated prompts to be developed.  - Exploring additional broad cognitive capabilities that could potentially be extracted from large language models through careful prompting. The authors demonstrated the extraction of logical reasoning skills, but suggest that other high-level abilities may also be hidden inside these models.- Combining zero-shot prompting approaches like the authors' method with instruction tuning techniques like InstructGPT to further improve zero-shot reasoning performance. The authors showed their prompt works with both standard and instruction-tuned LLMs.- Developing better automatic methods for generating effective reasoning prompts, rather than relying solely on manual engineering of prompt templates. The authors tested a variety of manually designed templates.- Applying insights from zero-shot prompting to better analyze and understand biases and limitations of large language model reasoning. By removing the confounding factor of few-shot examples, zero-shot probing could enable more unbiased model analysis.- Exploring the trade-offs between few-shot and zero-shot prompting in more depth across diverse reasoning tasks and model architectures. The authors made some comparisons but more research is needed.In summary, the main future directions are centered around developing more advanced zero-shot prompting techniques, probing the reasoning abilities of LLMs through zero-shot prompting, and better understanding the trade-offs between few-shot and zero-shot prompting approaches. More work is needed to fully uncover the reasoning potential of large language models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a novel zero-shot prompting method called Zero-shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) to elicit logical reasoning from large language models without requiring task-specific examples. The key idea is to insert a simple fixed prompt like "Let's think step by step" before the question to trigger the model to generate a step-by-step reasoning chain leading to the final answer. This allows extracting the chain of thought reasoning ability of large language models in a zero-shot manner, without injecting any human-designed reasoning examples that could bias the model. The method is shown to be versatile, improving performance over standard zero-shot prompting across a variety of reasoning tasks including arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning using a single fixed prompt. Empirical results on models like InstructGPT and PaLM demonstrate the efficacy of this simple technique to unlock logical reasoning skills in large pre-trained language models in a zero-shot way using task-agnostic prompting.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents a zero-shot chain of thought prompting method called Zero-shot-CoT to elicit reasoning from large language models. The key idea is to add a simple fixed prompt like "Let's think step by step" before the model answers a question, which encourages the model to generate a step-by-step reasoning chain. This differs from prior work on chain of thought prompting which requires carefully engineered reasoning demonstrations per task. Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense and logical reasoning datasets, the proposed method is shown to substantially improve zero-shot reasoning over standard prompting. For example, on the MultiArith dataset, accuracy improves from 17.7% to 78.7% using the InstructGPT-3 model. The gains are attributed to eliciting more broad cognitive capabilities, termed as "logical dark knowledge", rather than narrow task-specific skills. The single versatile prompt working across diverse reasoning tasks highlights rich untapped zero-shot knowledge hidden inside large pre-trained models. The proposed method serves as a strong baseline for reasoning tasks, while encouraging research into discovering more multi-task capabilities, akin to logical reasoning, through careful prompting. Overall, this work emphasizes the underestimated zero-shot reasoning potential of large language models.
