# [Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be whether large language models can effectively perform multi-step reasoning in a zero-shot setting, without any per-task prompt engineering or finetuning. Specifically, the paper investigates whether simply prefixing questions with a generic prompt like "Let's think step by step" can elicit logical reasoning and chains of thought from large language models. The key hypothesis seems to be that large language models have more capability for complex, multi-hop reasoning than previously believed, even in a zero-shot setting, and that this can be unlocked with a simple, task-independent prompting strategy. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis across a diverse set of reasoning tasks and benchmarks. Overall, the central research question revolves around assessing and unlocking the zero-shot reasoning potential of large language models through prompt engineering.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing and evaluating a simple prefix prompt "Let's think step by step" that can elicit logical reasoning and multi-step problem solving from large language models in a zero-shot manner. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Showing that large language models like GPT-3 and PaLM exhibit decent zero-shot reasoning capabilities when prompted with "Let's think step by step" before answering questions. This allows them to generate plausible step-by-step reasoning chains to reach the correct answers.

- Demonstrating that this simple prompt works consistently across diverse reasoning tasks including arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense, and other logical reasoning problems. This versatility indicates it is eliciting high-level, task-agnostic reasoning skills rather than narrow task-specific skills. 

- Comparing against strong baselines like few-shot prompting and showing large improvements in zero-shot reasoning performance. The scaling curves with model size for the zero-shot method also become comparable to few-shot prompting.

- Analyzing the sensitivity of few-shot vs zero-shot prompting, and arguing that the latter can reveal more unbiased capabilities of models without human biases from carefully curated examples.

- Broadly, providing new insights into the untapped zero-shot reasoning abilities hidden inside large pre-trained language models, which have been underestimated due to lack of exploration into task-generic prompts that elicit broad cognitive skills.

In summary, the main contribution is revealing and quantifying the stronger-than-expected zero-shot logical reasoning capabilities of large language models using a simple yet surprisingly versatile prompt.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

The key contribution of this paper is proposing a simple yet effective method for eliciting multi-step reasoning from large language models (LLMs) without any task-specific prompt engineering. Specifically, the authors show that just prompting the model with "Let's think step by step" before a question results in coherent chains of reasoning across diverse reasoning tasks. 

This differs from most prior work on improving reasoning in LLMs, which rely on task-specific prompt engineering or training, such as:

- Fine-tuning LLMs on datasets with step-by-step reasoning [1,2,3]. This requires expensive human annotation of reasoning processes.

- Using few-shot prompting with step-by-step reasoning demonstrations [4,5,6]. This also requires human engineering of reasoning prompts per task. 

- Designing reasoning templates and decompositions specifically for each task [7,8].

In contrast, the proposed method uses a simple fixed prompt to elicit complex multi-hop reasoning across tasks without any task-specific engineering. The versatility of the prompt hints at broad underlying reasoning capabilities in LLMs that can be extracted with the right prompt.

The most comparable work is [8], which also aims to facilitate multi-step reasoning from LLMs in a zero-shot manner. However, their approach requires substantial prompt engineering per task while the proposed approach uses a single fixed prompt for all tasks.

In summary, this work introduces a simple yet powerful prompt that unlocks multi-task reasoning abilities in LLMs without any task-specific engineering, contrasting prior prompting work that relies heavily on per-task prompt design and training. The findings highlight the efficacy of probing LLMs' reasoning skills through careful prompting.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing more sophisticated ways to extract the chain of thought reasoning from language models in a zero-shot manner, beyond just using the "Let's think step by step" prompt. The authors mention trying different prompt wording and structures to see their effect.

- Exploring other broad cognitive capabilities that could potentially be elicited from language models through careful prompting, beyond just logical reasoning. The authors suggest there may be additional high-level, task-agnostic knowledge hidden in the models that could be uncovered.

- Applying the zero-shot chain of thought prompting approach to more complex reasoning tasks and datasets, to further test its capabilities and limitations.

- Analyzing the differences between reasoning extracted via zero-shot prompting versus few-shot prompting more deeply, to understand the trade-offs and how they reflect the knowledge already inside the models.

- Using the zero-shot prompting as a tool to better analyze biases and capabilities of language models before any fine-tuning or few-shot prompting is applied.

- Developing better quantitative metrics and methods to evaluate the quality and correctness of the extracted reasoning chains, beyond just task accuracy.

- Combining zero-shot prompting with additional techniques like self-consistency ensembling to further improve multi-step reasoning.

In summary, the main future work revolves around better understanding and improving zero-shot prompting as a tool for extracting broad cognitive skills from language models, and using it as an analysis lens to study the models themselves in more depth. The simplicity yet effectiveness of the approach suggests there is still much more hidden potential to uncover.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel zero-shot prompting approach called Zero-shot Chain of Thought (Zero-shot-CoT) to elicit complex reasoning from large language models without requiring per-task prompt engineering. The key idea is to simply prepend the trigger prompt "Let's think step by step" before the question input. This generic prompt triggers the model to generate a step-by-step chain of reasoning before outputting the final answer. Unlike prior work on few-shot chain of thought prompting which requires careful prompt design with reasoning examples per task, the proposed method uses the same zero-shot prompt across diverse reasoning tasks. Experiments across arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense and logical reasoning datasets show significant gains over standard zero-shot prompting. The performance also scales better with model size. The simplicity and versatility of the fixed prompt across tasks indicates untapped zero-shot reasoning capabilities in large language models.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my reading, the key questions and problems that this paper is addressing are:

1. How can we understand and enhance the logical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs)? Many recent works have shown that scaling up LLMs leads to major improvements in natural language tasks, but performance on logical reasoning tasks has remained limited. This paper aims to improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs.

2. Can LLMs demonstrate strong multi-step reasoning skills in a zero-shot setting using simple prompting? Most prior work has focused on few-shot prompting with carefully designed reasoning examples. This paper investigates whether LLMs have untapped zero-shot reasoning skills that can be elicited through a simple prompt template. 

3. Is chain-of-thought prompting an inherent capability of LLMs rather than an artifact of few-shot learning? The chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting approach has shown impressive gains for LLMs on reasoning tasks. But it relies on few-shot examples, raising the question of whether the approach is capturing true reasoning skills versus exploiting the few-shot examples. This paper aims to answer this by reformulating CoT as a zero-shot prompt.

4. Can a single, task-agnostic prompt unlock logical reasoning across diverse tasks? Most prompting approaches are task-specific. This paper tests if a single fixed prompt can elicit multi-step reasoning across different types of logical reasoning tasks. 

5. What fundamental reasoning capabilities are "hidden" inside LLMs that can be extracted through careful probing? The authors suggest the strong zero-shot reasoning performance hints at high-level cognitive capabilities that exist within LLMs but require the right type of prompting to be revealed.

In summary, the key focus is understanding and improving the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs through zero-shot prompting, determining whether LLMs have inherent multi-step reasoning skills, and discovering the nature of their core reasoning capabilities. The paper challenges assumptions from prior work that depend on few-shot learning.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a summary of the key points: 

The paper proposes a novel approach for eliciting step-by-step reasoning from large language models without needing task-specific examples. It introduces a simple template called "Let's think step by step" that can be prepended to questions to trigger chain of thought reasoning across diverse tasks like arithmetic, symbolic, and logical reasoning. When evaluated on benchmarks like MultiArith and GSM8K, this Zero-Shot Chain of Thought (Zero-Shot-CoT) approach significantly boosts the zero-shot performance of models like InstructGPT and PaLM over standard prompting. The gains are comparable to few-shot CoT prompting that requires careful prompt engineering. The versatility of the single template hints at under-studied zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large LMs. The work highlights the importance of analyzing zero-shot knowledge in LLM before crafting per-task examples or prompts. It encourages more research into discovering task-agnostic, high-level cognitive capabilities via prompting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The proposed method transforms standard chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting from a few-shot to a zero-shot learning setting. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of this shift? How does it impact practical applicability and broader understanding of reasoning capabilities in LLMs?

2. The paper shows the proposed zero-shot CoT prompting improves performance over standard zero-shot prompting across diverse reasoning tasks. However, it still generally underperforms few-shot CoT prompting. What factors may account for this remaining gap? How could the zero-shot approach be improved to close this gap further?

3. The paper emphasizes the task-agnostic nature of the proposed single zero-shot CoT prompt across arithmetic, symbolic, commonsense and other reasoning tasks. What does this suggest about the level of reasoning capability being elicited - is it more narrow/specific or broad/general?
