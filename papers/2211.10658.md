# [EDGE: Editable Dance Generation From Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop an effective method for generating high-quality, diverse, and physically plausible dances conditioned on music input?

The key hypotheses/claims in addressing this question appear to be:

- Using a transformer-based diffusion model paired with a strong music feature extractor (Jukebox) can enable high-quality and diverse dance generation from music.

- Diffusion models confer powerful editing capabilities like joint-wise conditioning and in-betweening that are well-suited for dance generation.

- Physical plausibility, especially realistic foot-ground contact behavior, is an important aspect of dance generation that is not well captured by existing metrics. A new metric (PFC) can help evaluate this better.

- State-of-the-art techniques like the proposed EDGE method can significantly outperform previous dance generation systems in terms of diversity, physical plausibility, beat alignment, and human-evaluated realism and quality.

In summary, the central focus seems to be developing and evaluating a novel transformer-diffusion based approach (EDGE) for conditional dance generation that can produce high-quality, editable, and physically plausible results. The key hypotheses relate to the advantages of this proposed method over previous techniques.
