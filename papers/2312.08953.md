## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmark problems for black-box optimization algorithms often use simple mathematical functions and lack the characteristics of real-world engineering design problems. These problems are limited in scalability and diversity of Pareto front shapes.
- Real-world engineering design problems exhibit moderate multimodality due to governing equations. However, computationally cheap benchmark problems with such landscapes are scarce.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes 60 single and multi-objective optimization benchmark problems related to the fluid and structural design of human-powered aircrafts (HPAs). 
- The problems have 3 difficulty levels by changing the definition of design variables, allowing dimension scalability. 
- The objective functions emulate engineering design considerations based on integral equations from fluid dynamics and differential equations from mechanics.
- The multi-objective problems generate diverse Pareto front shapes including convex, linear, concave and inverted triangle forms.

Main Contributions:
- Novel, scalable benchmark problem suite with tunable difficulty levels and dimension, mimicking real-world engineering optimization.
- Emulation of governing equations enables benchmarking algorithms on problems with moderate multimodality.  
- Low computational cost (within 0.2 sec per evaluation) allows sufficient function evaluations.
- Multi-objective problems produce a variety of Pareto front shapes rarely seen in existing benchmarks.
- Open source implementation enables widespread use in the research community.
- Experiments show the ability to differentiate algorithm performance, identify issues in handling high dimensionality.

In summary, the paper presents a valuable and feature-rich set of engineering-inspired benchmark problems to facilitate more realistic algorithm testing at scale. The source code availability also enables broader engagement from the research community.
