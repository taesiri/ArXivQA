# [GelLink: A Compact Multi-phalanx Finger with Vision-based Tactile   Sensing and Proprioception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14887)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Fully-actuated robotic end-effectors are complex and costly. Underactuated ones are more adaptive, robust and cost-effective but lack sensing capabilities. 
- Existing underactuated fingers with tactile sensing mostly use force/pressure sensors with low resolution. Vision-based tactile sensors offer high resolution but integrating them into multi-phalanx fingers requires multiple cameras, increasing complexity.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper presents GelLink - a compact underactuated finger with only one motor and one camera. It uses a planar linkage mechanism for efficient torque transmission and a mirror-based setup to enable continuous tactile sensing over all phalanges using the single camera.  

- Linkage lengths are optimized using a simulator to allow 90 degree joint motion with good torque transmission angles. 

- A planar reflection simulator optimizes mirror positions so the camera can view all tactile pads continuously through finger motion. This also enables proprioception by tracking pad positions.

- The fabrication uses 3D printed phalanges with embedded acrylic+silicone tactile pads, aluminum linkage bars and flexible mirrors. Tactile pads are illuminated and imaged by the single camera with color separation.

Contributions:
- Compact underactuated design with only 1 motor and 1 camera through optimized linkage and reflection simulation.

- Continuous high resolution tactile sensing over all phalanges using vision-based tactile sensing. Prior multi-phalanx fingers needed multiple cameras.

- Proprioception by tracking tactile pad positions through optimized camera view.

- Demonstrated grasping of varied objects and perception of texture, size etc. through tactile imprints and proprioception.

The key novelty is enabling low complexity underactuation to be augmented with high resolution vision-based tactile and proprioceptive sensing.
