# [Variance-Dependent Regret Bounds for Non-stationary Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies non-stationary stochastic linear bandits, where the reward distribution changes over time. Existing algorithms only characterize the non-stationarity using the total variation budget $B_K$, which measures changes in the expected rewards. 

- This is insufficient in many real applications where both the mean and variance of rewards can change over time. The key open question is whether algorithms can be improved by also utilizing information about the variance.

Main Contributions:
- The paper proposes two novel algorithms, Restarted-WeightedOFUL+ and Restarted-SAVE+, that utilize both the total variation budget $B_K$ and the total variance $V_K$ to achieve tighter regret bounds. 

- Restarted-WeightedOFUL+ assumes known per-round variances. It achieves regret $\tilde{O}(d^{7/8}(B_KV_K)^{1/4}\sqrt{K} + d^{5/6}B_K^{1/3}K^{2/3})$, which is better than state-of-the-art when $V_K$ is small.

- Restarted-SAVE+ allows unknown per-round variances. It maintains multi-layer weighted linear models and achieves regret $\tilde{O}(d^{4/5}V_K^{2/5}B_K^{1/5}K^{2/5} + d^{2/3}B_K^{1/3}K^{2/3})$. This is still better when $V_K$ is small.

- A third algorithm Restarted-SAVE+-BOB is proposed to tackle fully unknown $V_K, B_K$ using bandits-over-bandits, with slight degradation in theoretical bounds.

- Experiments validate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over prior methods that do not use variance information.

To summarize, the key contribution is in designing more informative non-stationary bandit algorithms by further utilizing the variance information, which lead to provably tighter regret bounds and empirical improvements.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas in this paper:

The paper proposes new algorithms for non-stationary linear bandits that utilize variance information of the reward distributions to achieve tighter regret bounds compared to prior methods when the total variance is small.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) The paper proposes two new algorithms, Restarted-WeightedOFUL+ and Restarted-SAVE+, for non-stationary linear bandits that utilize both the mean and variance information of the changing reward distributions. These algorithms achieve tighter regret bounds compared to prior methods when the total variance is small.

2) The paper introduces a "restarting" scheme to deal with non-stationarity, where the algorithms periodically reset and forget historical data. This is combined with weighted ridge regression methods to handle heteroscedastic noise.

3) For the case where the per-round variance is unknown, the paper proposes a multi-layer algorithm Restarted-SAVE+ that maintains estimates of the feature vector at different layers to handle unknown variances.

4) The paper also introduces a bandit-over-bandit framework for the setting where both per-round variance and total variation budget are unknown. This uses a meta bandit algorithm to adaptively set parameters of the base algorithms.

5) Regret analysis is provided to show the proposed algorithms match or improve upon state-of-the-art in different settings. Experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods.

In summary, the key innovation is in developing new algorithms that effectively leverage variance information in addition to reward mean information to tackle non-stationary linear bandits. The regret bounds and experiments show the benefit of using this additional information.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Non-stationary stochastic linear bandits - The paper studies linear bandit problems where the reward distribution is non-stationary and evolves over time.

- Dynamic regret - The paper aims to minimize the dynamic regret, which measures the gap between the cumulative reward of the learner's policy and the cumulative reward of selecting the best arm at each time step. 

- Total variation budget - A quantity $B_K$ that measures the total amount of non-stationarity over $K$ rounds. It sums the $\ell_2$ norm of the differences in the mean reward vectors.

- Total variance - A quantity $V_K$ that measures the total variance of the reward distributions over $K$ rounds. 

- Heteroscedastic noise - The paper considers settings where the noise/variance in the rewards changes over time, known as heteroscedastic noise.

- Restarting - The algorithms restart periodically to forget old inaccurate estimates and address non-stationarity.

- Variance-dependent bounds - The paper shows regret bounds that depend on both the total variation budget and total variance, leveraging variance information.

- Weighted linear regression - Methods used to estimate the mean rewards that weight past samples by the inverse variance.

So in summary, key terms cover non-stationarity, regret definitions, problem parameters like $B_K$ and $V_K$, heteroscedasticity, algorithm techniques, and types of bounds.

8. The paper claims existing lower bounds still have gaps compared to the achieved regret. What are some ideas to bridge these gaps in future work?

9. How would you extend the proposed variance-dependent techniques to related settings such as non-stationary nonlinear bandits or reinforcement learning? What additional challenges would arise?

10. An open question posed is how to match existing lower bounds for non-stationary multi-armed bandits. Sketch a potential new algorithm and analysis that could achieve this. What different techniques would be required compared to the linear bandit setting?
