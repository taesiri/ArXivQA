# [Post-decoder Biasing for End-to-End Speech Recognition of Multi-turn   Medical Interview](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Knowledge-intensive scenarios like medical consultations contain many rare, domain-specific words that are critical for understanding but lack data to train speech recognition models well. 
- There is a shortage of publicly available speech corpora for these scenarios to enable research. Existing datasets have domain mismatch issues or lack multi-turn conversations.

Proposed Solution:
- Created a new multi-turn English medical consultation speech corpus called MED-IT with real doctor-patient conversations and frequent medical terminology.
- Propose a novel "post-decoder biasing" method to improve recognition of rare words in end-to-end models by constructing a transform probability matrix based on training set transcription distribution. This guides the model to prioritize recognizing words from a biasing list without much computational overhead.

Key Contributions:
1) New MED-IT dataset with over domain-specific named entities for contextual speech recognition research.
2) Post-decoder biasing approach that improves rare word recognition by 5-9% relative, with minimal impact on non-rare words.
3) Ablation studies validate the efficacy of both proposed components.

The paper makes notable contributions in releasing a valuable new speech dataset for an important but underserved research area, and introducing a lightweight method to enhance neural speech recognition's ability to capture critical domain terminology.
