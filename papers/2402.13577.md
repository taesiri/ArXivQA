# [BBA: Bi-Modal Behavioral Alignment for Reasoning with Large   Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13577)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Effectively utilizing large vision-language models (LVLMs) like GPT-4V for complex multimodal reasoning, especially with domain-specific languages (DSLs), is challenging.  
- Simply feeding LVLMs visual data and DSL representations leads to inconsistent reasoning mechanisms between modalities. 
- LVLMs also struggle with critical steps in multi-step reasoning tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new prompting method called Bi-Modal Behavioral Alignment (BBA) to integrate DSLs into reasoning.  
- First elicit separate reasoning chains from visual and DSL inputs to maintain their unique strengths.
- Then align the chains by identifying and resolving inconsistencies between them.
- Leverage differences to pinpoint critical steps and allocate more reasoning tokens to address them.

Key Contributions:
- BBA harmonizes behaviors from visual and DSL modalities via late fusion strategy rather than intermingling reasoning.
- Conversion of inconsistencies into beneficial signals to spot and resolve critical steps.  
- Experiments across geometry, chess, and molecules demonstrate BBA substantially improves performance of GPT-4V.
- Up to 14.26% relative gain in geometry problem solving.
- Up to 10.25% relative gain in chess positional advantage prediction.
- Up to 6.30% relative gain in molecular property prediction.

In summary, the paper introduces BBA to adeptly integrate DSLs into multimodal reasoning by aligning behaviors from different modalities and leveraging their differences to tackle critical steps. Experiments validate effectiveness across diverse reasoning tasks.
