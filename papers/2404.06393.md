# [MuPT: A Generative Symbolic Music Pretrained Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for music modeling, but struggle with structural coherence when using the prevalent MIDI format. 
- MIDI poses challenges for readability and clear structural representation of music.
- Mismatch can occur between measures from different tracks when generating multi-track music, due to ABC notation being written track-by-track.

Proposed Solution:
- Use ABC notation instead of MIDI as it is more compatible with LLM architecture and strengths.
- Propose Synchronized Multi-Track ABC Notation (SMT-ABC) to reorder tracks to preserve coherence of measures across tracks during generation.
- Explore Symbolic Music Scaling (SMS) Law relating model performance to training data size for ABC notation, offering insights for optimization.

Contributions:
- Develop Long-range Symbolic Music LLM with 8192 token context length, covering 90% of symbolic music data.
- SMT-ABC notation enhances structural integrity of generated multi-track music.
- Introduce SMS Law that reveals positive correlation between model size/data size and metric improvement for ABC notation.
- Unique training epoch dynamics for music repetition and performance. 
- Release suite of models and resources to advance research into symbolic music modeling.

In summary, the paper tackles limitations of MIDI-based music modeling with LLMs, and proposes using the more compatible ABC format along with a synchronized multi-track representation and scaling laws specialized for symbolic music data. The released models, techniques and insights aim to significantly advance symbolic music generation research.
