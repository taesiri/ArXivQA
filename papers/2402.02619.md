# [Increasing Trust in Language Models through the Reuse of Verified   Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02619)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) are powerful but can fail on rare edge cases, reducing reliability and trustworthiness. 
- There is a need for models that are "known good", meaning the model's algorithms and circuits are understood, it handles all edge cases, and has no known failure modes.

Proposed Solution: 
- Train transformer models using mathematically specified frameworks to meet a stringent "known good" standard of accuracy and trustworthiness.  
- Fully verify a 5-digit integer addition model, ensuring it implements known algorithms, handles all edge cases, and achieves 1 million question (1MQ) accuracy.
- Insert the verified addition model into a larger subtraction/addition model. Show extensive reuse of addition circuits for both tasks. This eases verification of the more complex mixed model.

Key Contributions:
- A known-good 5-digit addition model that is accurately predicted, reverse-engineered, and verified to have no errors in 1MQ testing.
- A method to enhance trustworthiness of larger models by integrating smaller, verified models, leveraging reuse to simplify verification.  
- Proof of concept for modularly constructing reliable LM components to facilitate the development of safe, trustworthy LMs.
- Support for the theory that many prediction tasks decompose into quantized knowledge/skill chunks that models must learn. Understanding models involves identifying these chunks.

In summary, the paper shows how verified model components can be reused within larger LMs to improve interpretability and trustworthiness, an important step towards ensuring safety. The modular approach also aids future research into safe LMs.
