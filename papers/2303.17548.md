# [Whose Opinions Do Language Models Reflect?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17548)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems the main contribution of this paper is:

1) Putting forth a quantitative framework to investigate the opinions reflected by language models, by leveraging high-quality public opinion polls and associated human responses.

2) Creating a new dataset called OpinionQA with 1498 questions spanning diverse topics, to evaluate the alignment of LM opinions with those of 60 US demographic groups. 

3) Analyzing current LMs using this framework and finding substantial misalignment between the views they reflect and those of US demographic groups, even after steering the models towards particular groups. 

4) Confirming prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of some human feedback-tuned LMs, and identifying groups like 65+ whose opinions are poorly reflected.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the development of a principled framework and dataset grounded in public opinion polls to quantitatively analyze and measure whose opinions language models reflect. The analysis provides insights into limitations of current LMs in capturing diverse viewpoints.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the abstract provided, this paper seems to align with and build upon previous work studying the emergence of opinions and biases in large language models (LLMs). Some key similarities and differences I notice:

- Like previous work by Perez et al. (2022) and Hartmann et al. (2023), this paper probes LLMs with subjective queries and finds evidence of certain left-leaning tendencies, especially in models fine-tuned with human feedback. However, this work goes further by quantitatively evaluating alignment with diverse human opinions.

- The approach of leveraging public opinion surveys/polls to systematically construct an evaluation dataset of subjective questions is novel. This allows for analyzing LLM opinions more comprehensively across many topics and demographic groups, rather than a few specific issues.

- The metrics defined, especially representativeness and steerability, provide quantitative ways to measure how well LLM opinions match those of general and specific human populations. This is a more nuanced perspective than just evaluating whether models reflect the modal views of certain groups.

- The analysis along multiple axes like representativeness, steerability, and consistency seems more thorough than prior work. The findings around human-feedback tuning leading to reduced representativeness and inconsistent opinions are notable.

- The limitations around evaluating subjective opinions and generalizing multiple-choice responses are thoughtfully discussed.

Overall, this paper makes excellent progress in rigorously studying the phenomenon of opinions in LLMs using public surveys. It provides novel quantitative insights, especially around representativeness and consistency, while building nicely upon recent related work. The approach could potentially be extended to other demographic groups and adapted to open-ended generation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Studying the alignment of LM opinions in more open-ended settings beyond multiple choice, to see if the trends transfer over. The authors state: "It is an open question whether opinion alignment that is measured through multiple choice will be reflected in the downstream use cases of LMs -- for example, will the liberal-leaning opinion alignment of RLHF fine-tuned models appear in a dialogue context or open-ended QA?"

- Building global equivalents of the OpinionQA dataset for non-US populations, to understand if the findings generalize. The authors note limitations in focusing solely on the US with its WEIRD cultural biases. 

- Developing techniques to control the alignment of LM opinions in a more nuanced way, for example steering towards representing a diversity of viewpoints rather than a single modal response. The authors suggest the metrics could be used as probes for developers rather than benchmarks to blindly optimize.

- Studying opinion consistency within and across individuals, to better contextualize the inconsistent opinions expressed by LMs. The authors state "after all even individuals can hold seemingly inconsistent beliefs."

- Considering the interplay between opinion alignment and undesirable attributes like toxicity, as perfectly matching human opinions may also replicate undesirable biases. 

- Expanding the notion of subjective evaluations like this work to other subjective NLP tasks beyond assessing opinions.

In summary, the key suggestions are to study alignment in more open-ended settings, expand the scope to non-US populations, develop more nuanced steering techniques, contextualize inconsistencies, consider undesirable effects of alignment, and expand subjective evaluations. The authors view the current work as an initial probe to spur research in these directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper presents a framework for evaluating the opinions reflected by language models (LMs) using multiple-choice questions from public opinion surveys. The authors create a dataset called OpinionQA using questions from Pew Research surveys spanning topics like science, politics, and relationships. They evaluate 9 LMs from AI21 Labs and OpenAI on this dataset by comparing the model opinion distributions to the distributions from human survey respondents overall and across 60 demographic groups. The analysis examines the representativeness, steerability, and consistency of LM opinions. Key findings are that current LMs are not well-aligned with US public opinion, human feedback tuning skews them towards certain groups like liberals, and they fail to accurately represent views of groups like the elderly. The framework provides a lens into whose opinions LMs reflect but has limitations around the US-centric dataset and multiple-choice format. Overall, the work contributes tools to quantitatively analyze subjective opinions held by LMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a framework for evaluating the opinions expressed by language models (LMs) by leveraging public opinion surveys. It introduces a new dataset called OpinionQA that contains 1498 multiple-choice questions from 15 Pew research surveys on topics ranging from abortion to automation. The questions come with human response distributions from the overall US populace as well as 60 demographic groups. 

The authors evaluate 9 LMs from OpenAI and AI21 Labs on OpinionQA, analyzing their representativeness, steerability, and consistency with respect to human opinions. They find substantial misalignment between LMs and US demographic groups that persists even after steering models towards those groups. The analysis also confirms prior observations about the left-leaning tendencies of human feedback trained LMs, while identifying new gaps like poor representation of certain groups like individuals 65+ in age. Overall, the work provides a quantitative lens to understand and improve the subjective alignment of LMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework to evaluate the opinions reflected by language models (LMs) by leveraging multiple-choice questions from public opinion surveys. The authors use questions from Pew Research's American Trends Panel surveys covering a range of topics to build a dataset called OpinionQA. For each question, they obtain the distribution of responses from the overall US population as well as across 60 demographic groups. To probe an LM, they format the multiple-choice question into a prompt and obtain the next-token probabilities for each answer choice. These probabilities are normalized to get the model's opinion distribution, which is compared to the human distributions using the Wasserstein distance. The similarity of an LM's distribution to that of the overall populace and specific groups indicates how representative it is of their opinions. The authors also test the steerability of LMs by adding context to the prompt to match a particular group. Overall, the use of survey data and distributional metrics allows the authors to quantitatively analyze whose opinions and perspectives current LMs reflect.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is:

Whose opinions (if any) do language models reflect?

The authors motivate this question by noting that language models are increasingly being used in open-ended contexts like dialogue agents, where they may offer opinions in response to subjective queries. However, it is not clear a priori whose opinions the language model might reflect, since many different humans are involved in shaping the model, from the creators of the training data to the model designers. Thus, the paper seeks to systematically analyze whose opinions are reflected in the responses of current language models to subjective questions.

The key contributions towards answering this question are:

1) Developing a framework and dataset based on public opinion surveys to quantitatively evaluate language model opinions and measure their alignment with diverse human viewpoints. 

2) Analyzing a range of language models using metrics of representativeness, steerability, and consistency to assess how well they capture the opinions of different demographic groups and the overall US populace.

3) Identifying several limitations of current models in accurately and consistently representing human opinions, even after steering the models towards particular groups.

In summary, the central research question is understanding whose opinions are reflected by language models when responding to subjective queries, which the paper investigates through a quantitative analysis using public opinion survey data.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, this paper seems to be addressing the following key questions:

1. Whose opinions (if any) do language models reflect? The abstract notes that language models are being used more in open-ended contexts where their responses to subjective queries can shape user beliefs. This raises the question of whose views and opinions these language models end up reflecting, given that many different humans are involved in shaping them.

2. How can we systematically evaluate and quantify the alignment of language model opinions with those of different human populations? The abstract mentions the need for an expansive, quantitative framework to project language model opinions onto the spectrum of human viewpoints. This involves identifying relevant topics to probe the models on and devising metrics to directly measure alignment with diverse human opinions. 

3. How representative are current language models of general and specific human populations? The abstract suggests analyzing language models along three axes - overall representativeness to the US populace, steerability or adaptability towards specific groups when prompted, and consistency across topics.

4. Do techniques like human feedback fine-tuning that are intended to improve human-alignment actually achieve that goal? The abstract hints that such techniques may amplify misalignment in some cases.

In summary, the central focus seems to be on quantitatively evaluating whose opinions and views current language models reflect, how aligned they are to different human populations, and whether human-alignment techniques are effective. The paper aims to develop a framework and dataset using public surveys to probe these questions in a rigorous manner.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points in the paper:

This paper develops a framework to study the opinions reflected by language models (LMs) and their alignment with different human populations. The authors leverage public opinion surveys, which are carefully designed to capture nuanced opinions on topics of public interest. They collect survey questions spanning diverse issues to build a new dataset called OpinionQA. This dataset contains questions from Pew Research surveys with associated responses from the US general populace and 60 demographic groups. Using OpinionQA, the authors evaluate 9 LMs from AI21 Labs and OpenAI by extracting an "opinion distribution" for each model and question. They compare these distributions to human responses and analyze alignment on three axes: (1) Overall representativeness: Current LMs are not well-aligned with the US populace overall. Human feedback tuning seems to reduce alignment. (2) Subgroup representativeness: Views of LMs align more with educated, wealthy, non-religious liberals. Groups like 65+ are very misaligned. (3) Steerability: Prompting with demographic info improves alignment, but substantial gaps persist. The authors highlight that their goal is not to optimize alignment blindly but to enable model developers and users to identify potential harms. Overall, this work provides a novel quantitative perspective into the diverse spectrum of opinions reflected (and misaligned) in large LMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates whose opinions language models reflect by evaluating them on public opinion survey questions and comparing their responses to those of various demographic groups.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper develops a framework to study the subjective opinions expressed by language models when responding to open-ended questions, using public opinion surveys as a testbed. The authors curate a new dataset called OpinionQA by adapting questions from Pew Research's American Trends Panel surveys into a multiple choice format suitable for prompting models. They use this to evaluate how well the opinion distributions from 9 language models with varying sizes and training strategies align with those of the overall US populace and 60 demographic subgroups. Their analysis finds substantial misalignment between model and human opinions, comparable to partisan disagreements on issues like climate change. The misalignment persists even after steering models towards specific groups. The paper also identifies that certain demographics like senior citizens are particularly poorly represented across models. Overall, the work provides a methodology and analysis to quantitatively understand whose views current language models reflect on a range of topics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using public opinion surveys as a tool to evaluate the alignment of language model opinions with those of the general public. How might the authors' methodology change if using surveys from other countries instead of just the Pew Research American Trends Panel surveys? What challenges might arise in adapting the framework cross-culturally?

2. The authors use the 1-Wasserstein distance to compare opinion distributions between models and human respondents. What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of using this metric over other distributional similarity measures? Under what conditions might an alternative metric be more suitable?

3. The authors evaluate both the default representativeness and steerability of language models. In practice, how might developers prioritize improving one aspect over the other depending on the intended application? What are some use cases where default representativeness is critical and others where steerability is more important?

4. When analyzing model consistency across topics, what might explain cases where certain models align with more conservative views on topics like religion versus more liberal views on other topics? How could the training data or model architecture contribute to these inconsistencies?

5. For measuring human opinion distributions, how sensitive are the results to factors like question wording, option ordering, and sampling in the survey design? How could variations in the survey methodology impact the conclusions drawn about language model alignment?

6. The paper identifies certain demographic groups (e.g. 65+, Mormon) that are poorly represented across models. What steps could be taken when training models to improve representation of these groups? Would changes to the training data, loss functions, or human feedback strategies help address this issue?

7. When analyzing steerability, the paper finds that current models still perform better on some groups than others after steering prompts are provided. What modifications could be made to steering methods like providing biographic context to enable more even improvements across groups? 

8. The authors use the term "alignment" to describe how well model opinions match those of human groups. However, perfect alignment may not always be desirable. How might the notion of alignment be refined to account for cases where we may not want models to exactly mimic certain human views?

9. The paper focuses on US demographics and the ATP survey. How might the conclusions change if evaluating models designed for other cultures? What are some key considerations in adapting this approach for non-Western contexts?

10. One limitation noted is the use of multiple choice questions versus open-ended generation. How feasible would it be to extract opinion distributions from free-form text generated by models instead? What annotation methods could be used to quantify alignment without pre-defined options?
