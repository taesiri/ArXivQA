# [Class-Discriminative Attention Maps for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViT) provide built-in attention maps (AM) that highlight semantic regions in images. However, AMs do not account for signals from a downstream classifier and thus fail to be discriminative for a target class. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM) which extend AMs by making them sensitive to a chosen target class or concept. 

- CDAM computes gradients of a class score or concept similarity score with respect to token activations in the last ViT block. This reveals how each token contributes evidence for/against the target.

- Two variants are presented: 1) Using predictions of a classifier trained on the ViT backbone to obtain class-specific CDAM. 2) Defining a concept via example images and using similarity in the ViT latent space to generate concept-specific CDAM.

Main Contributions:
- CDAM produces heatmaps that clearly distinguish objects belonging to the target class/concept vs other regions. This reveals the specific input features used by the model for its predictions.

- CDAM shows stronger class-discrimination than competing methods like relevance propagation and token ablation maps. It also exhibits implicit regularization, producing sparser heatmaps.

- The concept-based CDAM allows probing the latent space to understand learned representations, without needing classifier labels. Users can specify concepts of interest through example images.

- Analysis provides intuition for why CDAM appears to scale attention maps based on the relevance of tokens for the chosen target.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable extension to attention maps that reveals the evidence for and against a given class or concept that the ViT relies on.
