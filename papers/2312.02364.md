# [Class-Discriminative Attention Maps for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViT) provide built-in attention maps (AM) that highlight semantic regions in images. However, AMs do not account for signals from a downstream classifier and thus fail to be discriminative for a target class. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM) which extend AMs by making them sensitive to a chosen target class or concept. 

- CDAM computes gradients of a class score or concept similarity score with respect to token activations in the last ViT block. This reveals how each token contributes evidence for/against the target.

- Two variants are presented: 1) Using predictions of a classifier trained on the ViT backbone to obtain class-specific CDAM. 2) Defining a concept via example images and using similarity in the ViT latent space to generate concept-specific CDAM.

Main Contributions:
- CDAM produces heatmaps that clearly distinguish objects belonging to the target class/concept vs other regions. This reveals the specific input features used by the model for its predictions.

- CDAM shows stronger class-discrimination than competing methods like relevance propagation and token ablation maps. It also exhibits implicit regularization, producing sparser heatmaps.

- The concept-based CDAM allows probing the latent space to understand learned representations, without needing classifier labels. Users can specify concepts of interest through example images.

- Analysis provides intuition for why CDAM appears to scale attention maps based on the relevance of tokens for the chosen target.

In summary, the paper introduces an interpretable extension to attention maps that reveals the evidence for and against a given class or concept that the ViT relies on.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The proposed class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM) extend the inherent attention maps in vision transformers by scaling the attention scores according to the relevance of the corresponding tokens for a chosen target class or concept, resulting in semantically coherent and class-specific relevance scores.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM). Specifically:

- CDAM extends the inherent attention maps (AM) in vision transformers (ViT) to make them sensitive to a target class or concept defined by the user. This is done by calculating gradients of a class or similarity score with respect to the activations of the tokens entering the last transformer block.

- CDAM reveals the evidence for and against a target class that the model relies on for its predictions. The resulting heatmaps clearly distinguish objects belonging to the target class from the background and from other classes.

- In addition to explaining classifier predictions, CDAM can also explain user-defined concepts by using similarity measures between concept embeddings and image representations in the latent space of the ViT. This allows probing the learned representations for arbitrary concepts.

- Compared to other methods like relevance propagation and token ablation maps, CDAM shows stronger class-discrimination and compactness of explanations while still being semantically consistent. The signed relevance scores also help reveal counter-evidence for the target class.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of CDAM to extend attention maps in ViTs to be sensitive to a chosen class or concept, providing discriminative and compact explanations that reveal the evidence for model predictions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM): The proposed method to extend attention maps to be sensitive to a target class or concept by scaling the attention scores.

- Attention maps (AM): The built-in attention scores in vision transformers that provide semantic segmentation but are not class-discriminative. 

- Concept vector: Defined by averaging latent representations of images depicting a concept of interest. Used with a similarity measure instead of a classifier.

- Token ablation maps (TAM): Independent method that measures change in model output when removing image patch tokens. Used as a sanity check and baseline for CDAM.  

- Relevance propagation (RP): Previous state-of-the-art method for producing class-discriminative explanations in vision transformers. Compared to CDAM.

- Self-supervised learning (SSL): Used to train the vision transformer backbone model, producing high quality attention maps.

- Faithfulness: Discussed as an intrinsic challenge for post-hoc explanation methods to fully capture the complex interactions in neural networks.

The key focus is on proposing and analyzing CDAM as an extension of attention maps in vision transformers to make them class-discriminative for a target concept. Comparisons are made to other methods like TAM and RP.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the class-discriminative attention maps (CDAM) method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that CDAM scales the attention scores by how relevant the corresponding tokens are for the class/concept score. Can you elaborate on the mathematical justification behind this proportionality relationship? 

2. One interesting property of CDAM is that if a token has zero attention score, its CDAM score will also be zero. What causes this behavior and why is it useful?

3. How does the concept-based CDAM approach work for explaining user-defined concepts that the model has not been explicitly trained on? What are some potential applications of this capability?

4. The paper compares CDAM to other methods like relevance propagation (RP) and token ablation maps (TAM). Can you discuss the key strengths and weaknesses of CDAM versus these other methods? 

5. What modifications would be needed to apply the CDAM method to other transformer architectures beyond vision transformers, such as large language models?

6. The paper argues CDAM achieves a high degree of "correctness, contrastivity, and compactness" - unpack what each of these terms means and how CDAM demonstrates these properties.  

7. What are some of the inherent limitations of CDAM and post-hoc explanation methods more broadly in faithfully explaining model behavior due to model complexity and non-linear interactions?

8. How does the concept-based CDAM approach help probe the latent representations learned by vision transformers in a semi-supervised manner? What insights can this provide?

9. The paper introduces a token ablation study to generate token ablation maps (TAM) - discuss the motivation behind this method and how it serves as a sanity check for evaluating CDAM.

10. The CDAM formulation relies on first-order approximations using gradients. How could this formulation be extended to provide a higher-order explanation method? What challenges might this introduce?
