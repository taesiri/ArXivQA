# [Mitigating Hallucinations of Large Language Models via Knowledge   Consistent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10768)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) can produce persuasive yet false responses after alignment, a phenomenon known as "hallucination". 
- This is linked to the inconsistency between the external knowledge in the alignment data and the intrinsic knowledge inherited from pretraining.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces a Knowledge Consistent Alignment (KCA) approach to reduce knowledge inconsistency and mitigate hallucinations.  
- KCA detects knowledge inconsistency by formulating exams to test the LLM's understanding of external knowledge. 
- For inconsistent data, KCA applies open-book tuning, discarding tuning or refusal tuning to process the data before alignment.

Main Contributions:
- Establishes correlation between knowledge inconsistency and hallucination rates in LLMs. Higher inconsistency leads to more hallucinations.
- KCA significantly reduces hallucinations across different LLM architectures (Pythia, Llama, Mistral) evaluated on multiple benchmarks.  
- Refusal tuning is most effective, reducing hallucinations over 10% in some cases. Helpfulness is maintained with open-book and discarding tuning.
- Simple strategies in KCA lead to substantial hallucination reduction, highlighting the importance of knowledge-consistent data curation.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel KCA approach to mitigate hallucinations in aligned LLMs by detecting and handling knowledge inconsistency between training data and model knowledge. The efficacy of KCA is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Knowledge Consistent Alignment (KCA), a novel approach that detects and reduces inconsistency between the external knowledge in instruction-tuning data and the intrinsic knowledge in language models to mitigate hallucinations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a novel approach called Knowledge Consistent Alignment (KCA) to mitigate hallucinations in large language models after alignment. Specifically, KCA detects the inconsistency between the external knowledge in the alignment training data and the intrinsic knowledge inherited from pretraining by formulating examinations. Then it processes the inconsistent data using strategies like open-book tuning, discarding tuning, and refusal tuning before fine-tuning. Through experiments on models of different scales, the paper shows KCA can consistently and significantly reduce hallucination rates across various benchmarks while maintaining helpfulness. The key insight is that reducing the knowledge inconsistency between training data and model pretraining mitigates hallucination in alignment.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Knowledge consistent alignment (KCA): The main approach proposed in the paper to mitigate hallucinations of large language models through reducing knowledge inconsistency.

- Hallucination: The phenomenon where language models produce persuasive yet incorrect responses that contradict context or world knowledge. 

- Knowledge inconsistency: The discrepancy between the external knowledge in alignment data and intrinsic knowledge inherited from pretraining corpus.

- Examination formulation: KCA designs multiple choice questions to assess language models' understanding of implicit knowledge.  

- Open-book tuning: Providing supplementary contextual knowledge during tuning to prevent updating parameters towards inconsistent information.

- Discarding tuning: Removing inconsistent data from the tuning set to avoid learning incorrect knowledge.  

- Refusal tuning: Adjusting responses in inconsistent data to refusal format to stop language models from acquiring inconsistent knowledge.

In summary, the key focus is on mitigating hallucinations resulting from knowledge inconsistency, through techniques like examination formulation to detect inconsistency and open-book/discarding/refusal tuning to handle inconsistent data in the tuning process.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the knowledge consistent alignment (KCA) method proposed in this paper:

1. How does KCA detect knowledge inconsistency between the external knowledge in the alignment data and the intrinsic knowledge inherited from pretraining? What are the key steps involved?
