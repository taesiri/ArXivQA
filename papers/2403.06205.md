# [S-DyRF: Reference-Based Stylized Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06205)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most existing 3D stylization methods assume static scenes, which violates the dynamic nature of real-world scenes. Stylizing dynamic 3D scenes is challenging due to the limited availability of stylized reference images along the temporal dimension. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes S-DyRF, a reference-based spatio-temporal stylization method for dynamic neural radiance fields. The key idea is to introduce additional temporal cues besides the provided stylized reference image to facilitate style propagation across time. Specifically:

1) Generate temporal pseudo-references from the given stylized reference using video style transfer. These serve as supervision for consistent stylization over time. 

2) Perform spatio-temporal style transfer:
- Coarse style transfer that establishes content-style mapping and transfers style from pseudo-references to novel views/times at feature level. 
- Fine style transfer that registers stylized temporal pseudo-rays from pseudo-references to provide explicit stylization guidance.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a new task of stylizing dynamic 3D scenes using limited stylized reference images.

- Develops S-DyRF, a novel reference-based stylization method for dynamic neural radiance fields. Introduces temporal pseudo-references and pseudo-rays to facilitate style propagation across space and time.

- Achieves high-quality stylized novel view and time synthesis results on dynamic 3D scenes while maintaining consistency with the reference image.

- Enables controllable stylization of dynamic scenes based on user-provided references.

The experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate S-DyRF generates visually appealing stylized renderings of dynamic scenes and outperforms baseline approaches.
