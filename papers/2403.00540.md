# [Epsilon-Greedy Thompson Sampling to Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00540)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Thompson sampling (TS) is a popular Bayesian optimization (BO) method that addresses the exploitation-exploration dilemma by randomly sampling from the posterior distribution of the global minimum. However, the exploitation ability of vanilla TS is weak as it gathers information about the objective function in a random way after each exploration step. This paper aims to improve the exploitation of TS while retaining its exploration ability.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an ε-greedy TS approach that combines a generic TS (favors exploration) and a sample-average TS (favors exploitation) using an ε-greedy policy from reinforcement learning. Specifically, with probability ε, generic TS is performed to explore the input space. With probability 1-ε, sample-average TS is performed by averaging multiple sampled paths to guide the search towards exploitation. 

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualized two extremes of TS - generic TS for exploration and sample-average TS with sufficiently many samples for exploitation
- Incorporated ε-greedy policy to switch between the two TS extremes based on the ε value
- Empirical evaluations on benchmark functions show ε-greedy TS outperforms one extreme and competes with the other for appropriate ε
- Demonstrated the effects of varying ε and number of sampled paths on performance
- Showed computational cost of ε-greedy TS is comparable to generic TS

In summary, the paper introduces a simple and efficient ε-greedy TS method for BO that balances exploration and exploitation by tuning the ε value. Key results show improved exploitation over generic TS while retaining competitive exploration ability.
