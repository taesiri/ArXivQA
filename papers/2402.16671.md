# [StructLM: Towards Building Generalist Models for Structured Knowledge   Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT still struggle with structured knowledge grounding (SKG) tasks and lag behind state-of-the-art models by 35% on average. 
- There is a lack of generalist models that can ground on diverse types of structured knowledge to interface with humans. Prior work has focused on building task-specific models with limited generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- Constructed a large instruction tuning dataset with 1.1 million examples, comprising 18 SKG tasks and additional general instruction following data. 
- Trained and released 3 models based on the CodeLlama architecture at scales of 7B, 13B and 34B parameters, referred to as StructLM.

Main Contributions:  
- StructLM beats the previous state-of-the-art on 11 out of 18 SKG tasks. It also achieves new state-of-the-art results on 7 tasks, surpassing task-specific models.
- Demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization capability on 6 unseen SKG tasks, which was not shown by prior models. 
- Found that scaling model size from 7B to 34B parameters offered marginal benefits, suggesting structured knowledge grounding remains a challenging task needing more innovative designs.
- Showed the performance benefits of code pretraining and mixing general instruction data for improving SKG capabilities.

In summary, the paper proposed StructLM models to address the limitations of LLMs on structured knowledge grounding. The models were trained on a large instruction tuning dataset and demonstrated improved performance and generalization across diverse SKG tasks. But scaling model size did not lead to significant gains, highlighting it as an open challenge for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces StructLM, a series of models trained with instruction tuning on over 1 million examples to enhance structured knowledge grounding capabilities in language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 7 tasks and outperforming prior work on 14 out of 18 tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors construct a large structured knowledge grounding (SKG) instruction-tuning dataset with over 1.1 million samples. They train and release 3 models based on this dataset that outperform previous state-of-the-art models on 14 out of 18 SKG tasks. Their 34B model achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 of the tasks.

2. The authors show that their model, StructLM, is able to generalize well and perform zero-shot transfer on unseen SKG tasks, demonstrating a strong generalization capability not shown by previous models. 

3. The authors find that scaling up the amount of general instruction-tuning data, beyond just SKG data, improves the model's generalization ability. They also find that using a code-pretrained base model boosts performance on SKG tasks.

In summary, the main contributions are creating a large SKG instruction-tuning dataset to train high-performing few-shot models, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, and analyzing the effects of different training mixtures and base model choices.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What were the key motivations and goals behind developing StructLM as a generalist model for structured knowledge grounding tasks? Why did the authors believe existing models were lacking in this area?

2. The paper mentions constructing an instruction tuning dataset with over 1 million examples. Can you explain the process and considerations that went into curating this diverse dataset across different structured knowledge types?

3. The prompt format shown in Figure 3 is critical for enabling StructLM to process the input structured data. What are the key components of this prompt format and why are they important? 

4. The paper compares StructLM against several strong baselines like USKG and TableLlama. What were the key advantages of StructLM over these methods and why do you think that was the case?

5. One of the findings was that scaling up model size from 7B to 34B parameters offered only marginal improvements for StructLM. What implications does this have for future work on structured knowledge grounding?

6. How exactly does instruction tuning allow for beneficial cross-task generalization as shown in Table 2 of the paper? What is the intuition behind this?

7. The authors perform several insightful ablation studies in the paper. Can you summarize 2-3 key findings from these studies and what they tell us?

8. What role does incorporating general instruction following data play in improving the held-out dataset performance of StructLM? Why is this the case theoretically?

9. The paper argues structured knowledge grounding is still a challenging capability for large language models. Do you agree with this assessment based on the paper's findings? Why or why not?

10. What specific limitations of the StructLM method were outlined by the authors themselves? How can future work aim to address some of these limitations?
