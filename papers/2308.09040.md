# [SimFIR: A Simple Framework for Fisheye Image Rectification with   Self-supervised Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09040)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve fisheye image rectification by learning useful visual representations that capture the intrinsic distortion characteristics of fisheye images? The key hypothesis is that by designing a self-supervised pretext task to learn fine-grained distortion representations, the model can better rectify fisheye distortions when transferred to the downstream rectification task. Specifically, the pretext task associates different image patches with their specific distortion patterns/degrees and uses contrastive learning and distortion degree classification to learn representations invariant to image textures. The main experiments then validate that pre-training with this distortion-aware pretext task significantly boosts rectification performance compared to training without pre-training or with other pretext tasks.In summary, the paper proposes and verifies that self-supervised learning of intrinsic distortion characteristics, through a novel pretext task, can effectively improve fisheye image rectification. The intrinsic distortion patterns provide useful rectification cues that complement the texture/content information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing SimFIR, a self-supervised learning framework for fisheye image rectification. The key idea is to learn fine-grained distortion representations by associating image patches with specific distortion patterns. - Introducing a unified distortion-aware pretext task with contrastive learning and position loss to learn useful representations for rectification.- Proposing a new rectification pipeline that estimates a full resolution flow field to unwarp the image, allowing handling of arbitrary resolutions.- Constructing a synthesized fisheye dataset with multiple ground truth annotations (distortion-free image, flow field, parameters) for training and evaluation.- Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SimFIR over previous methods on synthetic and real-world fisheye images. The results also validate the benefits of the learned representations and the proposed rectification pipeline.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a self-supervised learning framework to learn distortion representations for fisheye rectification, along with a new flow-based rectification pipeline, dataset construction, and thorough evaluation. The key novelty lies in exploiting the intrinsic distortion patterns for representation learning to boost rectification performance.
