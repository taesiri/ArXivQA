   - Vector space models like Word2Vec, FastText, BERT to transform text into vector representations
   - Deep learning classifiers like CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs for tasks like concept extraction, relation classification etc.

- For medical images, deep learning models are used for segmentation (identifying objects like tumors) and classification tasks (mapping image features to categories for diagnosis etc.)

Main Contributions:
- Comparison of multiple NLP techniques and deep learning architectures based on latest research
- Analysis of techniques for key challenges like multi-word term detection, misspelling correction

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper discusses multiple vector space models for medical data such as Word2Vec, FastText, BERT, and sense2vec. Can you elaborate on the key differences between these models in terms of how they represent words and incorporate semantic and contextual information? What are the tradeoffs in using each one?

2. The paper talks about training domain-specific word embeddings for the medical field. What considerations need to be made when creating a medical dataset to train custom embeddings versus using pre-trained embeddings? What strategies can be used to adapt general embeddings to the medical domain?  

3. When evaluating word embeddings, the paper recommends using a variance-based nearest neighbors approach rather than requiring labeled medical datasets. Can you explain this method for determining model variation? What are the advantages over intrinsic evaluation methods that rely on annotated similarity datasets?

4. For medical text classification, the paper discusses CNN, RNN, LSTM, and Boltzmann machine-based neural networks. What are the key strengths and differences between these architectures for processing clinical notes and reports? What factors determine which one to select for a given project?

5. The paper proposes a Fully-Connected LSTM architecture that outperforms other LSTM variants for medical concept extraction. Can you explain how the connections differ in this architecture and why it provides superior performance? What limitations does it have?

6. Data preprocessing is highlighted as a crucial first step for medical NLP. What are the recommended sub-steps for cleaning and preparing unstructured physician notes and reports? What role does abbreviation disambiguation play here?  

7. For misspelling correction, the paper describes isolated word methods based on edit distance versus context-based methods with word embeddings. What algorithm does the MOE model use to accomplish supervised spell correction? Why might this outperform other approaches?

8. What Deep Learning architectures beyond LSTM and CNN are highlighted for processing medical text and images? Can you explain how Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks differ in their structure?  

9. The paper emphasizes using both intrinsic and extrinsic techniques to evaluate word embeddings for the medical domain. What metrics are provided for each category and why use both? What publicly available medical evaluation datasets are named?

10. For medical images, what differences exist between segmentation and classification tasks in terms of applicable Deep Learning models? What types of architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance and what are their limitations?
