## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Beyond Generalization: A Survey of Out-Of-Distribution Adaptation on Graphs":

Problem:
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on graph-structured data. However, their performance often degrades significantly when the test data distribution shifts from the training distribution. This issue of out-of-distribution (OOD) adaptation is critical for enabling reliable graph machine learning in real-world applications. 

The paper formally defines two problems: (1) training-time graph OOD adaptation, where both source and target data are available for model training, and (2) test-time graph OOD adaptation, where only a model pre-trained on source data is available and needs to be adapted to the target distribution. It also discusses different types of distribution shifts on graphs related to structure, size, features and labels.

Proposed Solution:
The paper categorizes existing methods into model-centric and data-centric approaches. Model-centric methods focus on the model design and learning process. This includes learning aligned representations across distributions through domain-invariant learning, concept-shift aware learning or model regularization. Data-centric methods manipulate the input data, like instance weighting, graph transformation by adding/removing edges, and feature reconstruction at test time. 

The paper also provides a taxonomy based on: (1) training vs test time adaptation, and (2) model-centric vs data-centric approaches. It reviews techniques under each category for mitigating distribution shifts and adapting GNNs to new distributions.

Main Contributions:
- First systematic review of graph OOD adaptation methods, covering both training and test time scenarios
- Formal problem definitions and discussion of graph distribution shift types
- Proposed taxonomy to categorize existing methods based on learning paradigm and techniques
- Detailed review of techniques behind existing model-centric and data-centric graph OOD adaptation methods 
- Highlights promising future research directions in this evolving field

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive review of the graph OOD adaptation literature and sets the stage for advancing research in this critical area to enable reliable graph machine learning under distribution shifts.
