# [Enhancing Programming Error Messages in Real Time with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT running the GPT-4 model, to provide real-time feedback on student code submissions in an introductory programming course. The goal is to enhance the error messages and feedback students receive when submitting coding assignments to an automated assessment tool called Athene. 

The authors implement a plugin that sends student code submissions to ChatGPT, which then provides a hint or advice back to the student without providing any actual code or direct solutions. The hint is displayed to students under an "AI Feedback" section when they submit. 

The study examines student submission logs and surveys students for their perceptions of the AI feedback. Contrary to expectations, students made significantly more submissions on average with the AI feedback than in previous years without it. Survey responses showed mixed opinions on the helpfulness of the hints, with common complaints that the AI feedback was too vague or generic to be useful. 

The authors conclude that simply adding AI feedback does not necessarily improve the student experience. The interaction style and ability to have some back and forth with the AI system may impact how useful and trustworthy students find such hints. More research is needed on designing interfaces that allow limited dialog with generative AI to provide submission feedback.

In summary, the key contributions are implementing GPT-4 feedback for an automated assessment tool across compiler, runtime, and logic errors, analyzing the impact on student submission rates and perceptions, and providing design considerations for using generative AI to enhance programming assignment feedback.
