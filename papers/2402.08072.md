# [Enhancing Programming Error Messages in Real Time with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper explores using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT running the GPT-4 model, to provide real-time feedback on student code submissions in an introductory programming course. The goal is to enhance the error messages and feedback students receive when submitting coding assignments to an automated assessment tool called Athene. 

The authors implement a plugin that sends student code submissions to ChatGPT, which then provides a hint or advice back to the student without providing any actual code or direct solutions. The hint is displayed to students under an "AI Feedback" section when they submit. 

The study examines student submission logs and surveys students for their perceptions of the AI feedback. Contrary to expectations, students made significantly more submissions on average with the AI feedback than in previous years without it. Survey responses showed mixed opinions on the helpfulness of the hints, with common complaints that the AI feedback was too vague or generic to be useful. 

The authors conclude that simply adding AI feedback does not necessarily improve the student experience. The interaction style and ability to have some back and forth with the AI system may impact how useful and trustworthy students find such hints. More research is needed on designing interfaces that allow limited dialog with generative AI to provide submission feedback.

In summary, the key contributions are implementing GPT-4 feedback for an automated assessment tool across compiler, runtime, and logic errors, analyzing the impact on student submission rates and perceptions, and providing design considerations for using generative AI to enhance programming assignment feedback.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

Students were more engaged and submitted code more often when provided real-time AI feedback on programming assignments through an automated assessment tool, but found the vague or incorrect hints frustrating and wanted more interactive dialogue with the AI system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Implementing generative AI into an automated assessment tool to enhance all programming error messages at both compile time and run time, as well as logic errors, for the first time. 

2. Discussing design considerations for integrating generative AI into automated assessment tools. The implications for how students utilize such feedback can help both future researchers and tool creators make more usable interfaces.

So in summary, this paper makes two key contributions - first, being the novel implementation of generative AI to provide feedback on all types of errors in student code submissions to an automated grading system, and second, providing insights into how to design the interface and interaction style when integrating generative AI into such systems in order to maximize usability and benefits for students.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. The authors chose to implement their AI feedback plugin with ChatGPT running on GPT-4. What are some of the key architectural and capability differences between GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 that may have impacted this choice?

2. The prompt engineering to coerce ChatGPT into providing hints without solutions seems critical to the success of this approach. What are some ways the prompt could be further refined to produce even more tailored and useful hints? 

3. The authors note that students wanted more specific, narrower hints from the AI. However, too narrow hints border on solutions. How could the interface be designed to allow students to iteratively ask for narrower hints while still avoiding providing solutions?

4. The lack of interactivity with the AI system was cited as a drawback by students. What are some ways a conversational interface could be added while avoiding harmful responses from the AI? How might the authors balance these issues?

5. The authors found submitting for AI feedback alone increased engagement. Could this lead students to become overreliant on external feedback versus building metacognitive self-monitoring skills? How might the system scaffold students toward independence?  

6. What other student interaction data besides submissions could the authors have collected to better understand perceptions and engagement with the AI feedback? 

7. The authors note the interface impacts usefulness and trust. What specific interface guidelines should be followed when adding AI assistance to avoid negative outcomes? 

8. What other assignments would be well suited for this type of AI augmentation? What assignments would be risky or unsuitable? Justify your choices.

9. The authors used a plug-in architecture. What would a more tightly integrated AI feedback system look like architecturally? What would the pros and cons of that approach be?

10. The authors note accuracy concerns with AI feedback. What measures could be added to detect, alert users to, and recover from inaccurate AI responses? How might the system gracefully handle uncertainties?
