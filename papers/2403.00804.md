# [Uncovering Customer Issues through Topological Natural Language Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
E-commerce companies receive a high volume of customer service requests daily. Thoroughly exploring each customer issue is challenging, especially during emerging events when companies need to quickly identify and address specific problems. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel machine learning framework to monitor emerging and trending customer issues without needing predefined lists. Their approach has three main components:

1. An attention-based deep learning model that tags the primary question sentence in each customer transcript and generates sentence-level embedding vectors.

2. A whitening technique that transforms the embeddings into an isotropic coordinate system to improve cosine similarity performance. 

3. A topological analysis method that constructs an undirected graph based on cosine similarity between whitened sentence vectors, then analyzes the graph topology by calculating the centrality of each node (customer question) to quantify trending and emerging issues.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates a sentence-level attention mechanism to identify key sentences in customer-agent transcripts.

- Combines the attention model with topological data analysis for extracting useful real-world information from conversational data.

- Introduces new centrality metrics based on the matching of time windows between graph nodes to effectively detect trending and emerging topics.

- Validates the model's ability to uncover trending topics constituting a large portion of product volumes and emerging topics consistent with online forums and news.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in applying natural language processing and topological graph analysis to solve a practical business challenge of identifying critical customer service issues efficiently.
