## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Masked LoGoNet: Fast and Accurate 3D Image Analysis for Medical Domain":

Problem:
- Medical image segmentation is challenging due to organs spanning large receptive fields, having irregular shapes, complex boundaries, and appearance variations. 
- Lack of large-scale labeled medical imaging datasets limits applicability of computer vision methods.
- Deployed medical image analysis systems need to process large volumes of data daily, demanding substantial computational resources.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce LoGoNet, a new neural network architecture with tailored self-supervised learning for fast and accurate 3D medical image segmentation.

- LoGoNet integrates a novel feature extractor (ULKANet) within a U-Net architecture, using Large Kernel Attention and dual encoding to capture both long-range and short-range feature dependencies effectively instead of solely increasing network capacity.

- Propose novel self-supervision technique combining masking and contrastive learning in a multi-task framework to exploit unlabeled 3D images and alleviate need for large labeled datasets. Compatible with both CNN and ViT-based models.

Main Contributions:
- Resource-efficient LoGoNet model with short inference time that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy by using ULKANet feature extractor and dual encoding rather than bigger model size.

- Multi-task self-supervision technique utilizing masking and pseudo-labeling specifically tailored for 3D images to enable utilizing unlabeled data. Model-agnostic and enhances generalization.

- Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation across 19 tasks in BTCV and MSD datasets highlighting accuracy, efficiency and visualization of superiority over 8 state-of-the-art baseline models.
