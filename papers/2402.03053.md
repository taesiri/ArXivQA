# [Multi-Lingual Malaysian Embedding: Leveraging Large Language Models for   Semantic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the gap in effective open-source embedding models tailored for the intricacies of the Malay language. Generic models struggle to capture the nuances of Malay linguistics. This limits performance in semantic search tasks critical for conversational AI chatbots.

Proposed Solution:
The authors present an approach to develop custom Malaysian embedding models optimized for semantic similarity and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Key aspects include:

1) Hard mining dataset refinement using spatial data structures to isolate challenging text pairs for enhanced model training.

2) Synthetic RAG dataset generation using QA pairs tailored to longer Malay texts to improve contextual understanding. 

3) Fine-tuning large pre-trained Malaysian Llama2 language models using a contrastive loss function. Models with 600M to 2B parameters extracted from initial layers are continued pre-training and fine-tuned.

Main Contributions:

- Release of open-source Malaysian embedding models outperforming proprietary solutions in semantic search evaluations. 600M parameter Llama2 exceeded text-embedding-ada-002 in similarity metrics across diverse test sets.

- Competitive RAG embeddings, with the 2B parameter model surpassing ada-002 in Recall@5, Recall@10 for research papers and Recall@3 to Recall@10 on legal dataset.

- Demonstration of an effective strategy for developing performant in-language embeddings attuned to the semantics of Malay texts.

The models and techniques open opportunities for more accessible and customizable Malaysian NLP capabilities to power conversational AI applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents open-source Malaysian language models leveraging large models and hard mining techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance on semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation tasks for the Malay language.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing an open-source Malaysian embedding model that outperforms existing models on tasks like semantic similarity and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Specifically:

- The paper presents a comprehensive exploration of finetuning Malaysian language models Llama2 and Mistral on embedding tasks involving positive and negative pairs. 

- For semantic similarity, their 600M parameter Llama2 model beats OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 on recall@k metrics across several Malaysian test sets.

- For RAG, their 2B parameter Llama2 model is competitive with OpenAI's model on Malaysian datasets, achieving superior performance on some metrics. 

- The authors release two distinct Malaysian embedding models tailored for semantic similarity and RAG tasks. 

- The findings highlight the effectiveness of their finetuning strategy for Malaysian embedding models and the performance gains over generic models.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing high-quality open-source Malaysian embedding models that outperform existing options on key NLP tasks for the Malaysian language context.

The paper focuses on developing open-source embedding models tailored for the Malaysian language by leveraging large pre-trained language models. It employs techniques like hard mining and contrastive fine-tuning to optimize the models for semantic similarity and retrieval tasks. The models are evaluated using recall@k metrics on diverse Malaysian datasets.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using ChatGPT3.5 to generate a synthetic Malaysian Open QA dataset. What are some of the potential challenges or limitations of using a synthetic dataset compared to a human-curated dataset? How might the authors mitigate any risks of bias or lack of diversity?

2. In Section 3.1 on the hard mining dataset procedure, the authors use a percentile-based approach to capture variability around a base text. What percentage range did they use and why did they choose that specific range? How sensitive are the results to this hyperparameter choice? 

3. The SciPy spatial KDTree approach is used for efficiency reasons in the hard mining process. What are the time and memory complexity tradeoffs compared to using alternative approaches like Faiss? Under what conditions might an alternative approach be preferred?

4. For the continued pretraining described in Section 3.2, what criteria did the authors use to determine extracting the first N layers from the base Llama2 model? Did they experiment with other layer configurations and if so, how did the performance compare?

5. In the contrastive fine-tuning phase, what values were chosen for the margin parameter alpha in the loss function? What impact does this alpha parameter have on discouraging negative pairs?

6. The recall@k metric is used to evaluate model performance. What are some limitations of this metric and why did the authors select it over other alternatives? What additional metrics could complement the analysis?  

7. For the semantic similarity task evaluation, there is a noticeable gap in performance between the news and Twitter datasets. What factors might account for this difference and how might the model's performance be improved for the lower performing dataset?

8. The authors utilize both a 100% hard mining dataset and a 30% synthetic dataset for fine-tuning. What is the motivation behind blending both real and synthetic data? Is there an optimal mixing ratio?

9. How were the positive and negative pairs constructed for the synthetic RAG dataset described in Section 2? What steps were taken to ensure relevance and diversity?

10. In terms of model parameter size, where does performance plateau in the tradeoff between accuracy gains and computational/memory costs? Is the 2 billion parameter model worth the additional resources compared to the 1 billion parameter option?
