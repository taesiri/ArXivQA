# [Label Supervised LLaMA Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01208)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is: 

What is the feasibility and effectiveness of adapting large language models (LLMs) for supervised sequence and token classification tasks through label-supervised finetuning?

In particular, the paper investigates:

- Whether the latent representations extracted from the decoder layers of LLMs like LLaMA can serve as effective text encodings for classification tasks when paired with label supervision. 

- How finetuning LLMs in a label-supervised manner, termed LS-LLaMA, can improve their performance on multiclass text classification benchmarks compared to zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction-tuned LLMs.

- Whether removing the causal masks from LLaMA decoders, termed LS-unLLaMA, can further boost performance on token-level tasks like named entity recognition (NER) by allowing bidirectional context.

The central hypothesis is that label-supervised finetuning can unlock the potential of LLM representations for discriminative classification tasks they were not originally designed for, surpassing prompting and instruction-tuning approaches. The results provide evidence for the viability of adapting LLMs through direct label supervision and show the benefits of unmasking for token tasks.

In summary, the paper explores whether LLMs can be adapted to excel at classification by extracting and finetuning their latent representations in a label-supervised manner, which is a novel approach compared to leveraging their generative capabilities. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated empirically on both sequence and token classification datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Introducing a label-supervised adaptation method for large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA. The key idea is to extract latent representations from the LLM decoders and use them for supervised discriminative label prediction. 

2. Proposing two variants - LS-LLaMA which keeps the causal masks in the decoder, and LS-unLLaMA which removes the causal masks. Removing the masks enables attending bidirectionally and improves performance on token-level tasks.

3. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that both LS-LLaMA and LS-unLLaMA achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines like BERT and RoBERTa on text classification benchmarks. The adapted LLMs also reach state-of-the-art on named entity recognition. 

4. Showing the feasibility of effectively utilizing the latent representations from LLMs for a range of downstream classification tasks. This provides a novel perspective on leveraging the knowledge learned by LLMs.

5. Identifying that the performance does not necessarily improve with larger LLM size due to overfitting on limited training data. Sufficient labeled data is important for effectively finetuning large LLMs.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and validating a simple yet effective label-supervised adaptation approach to enhance LLM performance on classification tasks, unveiling the potential of LLM latent representations, and providing insights into finetuning considerations.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel supervised adaptation approach for LLMs that outperforms strong baselines on diverse text and token classification tasks. The empirical analysis is more extensive than prior work. The findings open up new ways to effectively adapt LLMs for downstream tasks by leveraging their latent representations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different prompt engineering techniques to further enhance the performance of label-supervised LLaMA, such as chain-of-thought prompting and tree-of-thought prompting. The authors suggest prompt engineering could provide additional benefits on top of the label-supervised finetuning approach.

- Applying the label-supervised finetuning approach to other large language models besides LLaMA, such as GPT and PaLM, to see if similar performance gains can be achieved. 

- Experimenting with larger versions of LLaMA, such as LLaMA-2-13B and LLaMA-2-36B, using the label-supervised finetuning approach. The authors found finetuning the larger 13B LLaMA did not provide benefits over the 7B version, but suggest trying other larger sizes with more training data.

- Evaluating the label-supervised LLaMA on a broader range of sequence and token classification tasks beyond text classification and NER. The authors believe the approach could be beneficial for many downstream NLP applications needing discriminative capabilities.

- Further analysis into why removing the causal mask in LS-unLLaMA provided significant gains for token classification. More research could provide insights into how to optimize LLMs for token-level tasks.

- Exploring other parameter-efficient finetuning techniques besides LoRA that could work well with the label-supervised approach and large LLMs.

In summary, the authors see many opportunities to build on this label-supervised finetuning approach for LLMs and evaluate it across models, tasks, and techniques to further improve performance. There is still much to explore in effectively leveraging the capabilities of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a label-supervised adaptation approach for large language models (LLMs) called Label Supervised LLaMA (LS-LLaMA). The key idea is to leverage the latent representations from the LLaMA decoder as features for downstream discriminative tasks like text classification and named entity recognition (NER). Instead of using LLMs just for text generation as in previous work, the authors propose extracting the vector representations from the last LLaMA layer and adding task-specific feedforward layers on top to predict labels. This allows finetuning the LLM parameters using cross-entropy loss for the label predictions. Experiments on text classification benchmarks show LS-LLaMA substantially outperforms instruction-tuned LLaMA and even robust models like BERT/RoBERTa. For NER, a limitation arises due to the causal mask which restricts bidirectional context. Removing the causal mask gives the proposed Label Supervised unmasked LLaMA (LS-unLLaMA) which achieves new state-of-the-art on NER datasets. Overall, the work presents an effective way to adapt LLMs for discriminative tasks through label-supervised finetuning. The results demonstrate LLMs can serve as powerful encoders when provided with explicit label supervision during finetuning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method for label supervised finetuning of large language models (LLMs) such as Meta's LLaMA model. The key idea is to leverage the latent representations from the LLaMA decoder, which are normally used for next token prediction in autoregressive text generation, and adapt them for discriminative label prediction. Specifically, the authors extract the latent vectors from the last LLaMA layer and map them to label space via feedforward layers to get logits for classification. They calculate cross-entropy loss between the logits and ground truth labels, and finetune LLaMA using this supervision with low-rank adaptation. 

The authors test their proposed Label Supervised LLaMA (LS-LLaMA) on text classification benchmarks including sentiment analysis, news categorization, and financial sentiment tasks. Without sophisticated prompting or external knowledge, LS-LLaMA substantially outperforms baselines like instruction-tuned LLaMA, BERT, and RoBERTa. To address limitations of the causal mask for token-level tasks like NER, the authors propose Label Supervised unmasked LLaMA (LS-unLLaMA) which removes the causal mask. This variant achieves state-of-the-art performance on NER datasets, outperforming LS-LLaMA by a large margin. Overall, the label supervised finetuning approach enables effective task adaptation for LLMs on both sequence and token classification problems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a label supervised adaptation approach for finetuning large language models (LLMs) on sequence and token classification tasks. Specifically, the authors extract latent representations from the final layer of the LLaMA model and map them to label space via feedforward layers to compute cross-entropy loss for discriminative label prediction. They introduce two variants - LS-LLaMA keeps the causal masks in the LLaMA decoder blocks, while LS-unLLaMA removes the causal masks to allow bidirectional attention. Both variants are finetuned with the computed loss using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Experiments on text classification show LS-LLaMA and LS-unLLaMA substantially outperform LLMs under zero-shot, few-shot and instruction tuning settings. On named entity recognition tasks, removing the causal mask in LS-unLLaMA leads to significant further improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results. The label supervised adaptation provides an effective way to leverage the latent representations of LLMs for a range of downstream classification tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper appears to be introducing and evaluating a novel method for adapting large language models (LLMs) to perform well on sequence and token classification tasks like text classification and named entity recognition. 

The key questions and problems it is trying to address are:

- LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA have shown impressive performance on text generation tasks, but struggle on classification tasks with predefined label sets. This paper investigates whether LLMs can be adapted to excel at these kinds of tasks too.

- Prior work has tried using instruction tuning to adapt LLMs for classification, but their performance still lags behind discriminative models like BERT. This paper explores directly training the LLMs in a label-supervised way, similar to BERT fine-tuning. 

- LLMs have a causal mask that prevents bidirectional information flow. This paper tests whether removing this mask and exposing the full context can further improve performance on token-level tasks like NER.

- It examines whether smaller-scale LLMs like the 7B parameter LLaMA-2 can reach or surpass the classification performance of much larger models when adapted through this label-supervised approach.

In summary, the key focus is on introducing label-supervised fine-tuning to boost LLMs' capabilities on critical NLP classification tasks, where they have traditionally been weaker compared to generation. The paper empirically evaluates the impact of this approach and the effects of removing causal masking.
