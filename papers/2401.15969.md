# [Routers in Vision Mixture of Experts: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15969)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models are promising for scaling up model capacity without significantly increasing computational cost. A key component of MoEs is the router, which decides which subset of parameters (experts) process which feature embeddings (tokens). Prior work developed routers mainly for language modeling, and it is unclear how well they perform in computer vision tasks and how different routers compare.

Approach: 
The authors present a unified MoE formulation that subsumes different MoEs with two parametric routing tensors: dispatch tensor $\mD_{\mX}$ and combine tensor $\mC_{\mX}$. This formulation covers both sparse MoE that uses a hard expert-token assignment, and soft MoE that uses a soft assignment between experts and weighted combinations of tokens.

The routers for sparse MoEs are further grouped into two variants: 
1) Token Choice matches experts to each token 
2) Expert Choice matches tokens to each expert

Contributions:
The authors conduct comprehensive experiments with 6 routers on image classification, including existing ones like softmax token choice, sinkhorn token choice, softmax expert choice, and a new router they introduced called sinkhorn expert choice. The key findings are:

1) Many language modeling routers can be adapted to perform strongly for vision tasks. Specifically, expert choice routers consistently outperform token choice. 

2) In sparse MoE, the expert choice algorithm generally works better than token choice algorithm. This factor outweighs other algorithmic choices in sparse MoE routing.

3) With a fixed compute budget, the proposed soft MoE router generally outperforms all sparse variants, including previously reported ones and the newly introduced sinkhorn expert choice router.

The results provide new insights into the crucial role routers play in vision MoE models. The unified formulation also allows easy adaptations of routers across domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study comparing different routing algorithms for mixture-of-experts models on computer vision tasks, finding that expert choice routers tend to outperform token choice routers and soft mixture-of-experts outperform sparse formulations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a unified formulation of MoE layers by parametrizing routing tensors. This unified approach allows for comparison of existing MoE routers and motivates the introduction of new routers.

2) It shows that many sparse MoE routers originally developed for language modeling can be adopted as strong baselines in vision tasks. Specifically, routers employing the Expert Choice algorithm consistently outperform those based on the Token Choice algorithm.

3) It demonstrates that the soft MoE router generally outperforms the sparse variants under a fixed compute budget.

In summary, the paper presents a comprehensive study of routers in vision MoE models. It introduces a unified formulation to allow comparison of different routers, shows that many language MoE routers transfer well to vision, and finds that Expert Choice routers and Soft MoE routers perform the best in their experiments.
