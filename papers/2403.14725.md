# [Jailbreaking is Best Solved by Definition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14725)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Recently, attackers have been able to elicit unsafe or undesirable responses from language models through "jailbreaking" attacks. This has led to a flurry of defenses aimed at preventing such outputs. 

- The paper critically examines two stages of defenses: (1) defining what constitutes unsafe outputs, and (2) enforcing that definition via input processing or model fine-tuning. 

- It introduces the "Purple Problem" as a simple, well-defined task of preventing a model from outputting the word "purple". Surprisingly, even for this simple problem, current defenses fail.

Key Insights
- The paper shows that current enforcement mechanisms (input filtering, fine-tuning) fail to defend even against the Purple Problem, whereas output filtering is perfectly robust. 

- This suggests that the real challenge lies in obtaining a good definition of unsafe responses. With a good definition, output filtering works well; without it, no enforcement method can succeed.

- The paper argues that most innovations around enforcement provide little value without clear progress on better specifying unsafe behaviors. It advocates for more research effort into developing methods for capturing nuanced definitions of unsafe outputs.

Proposed Solutions and Contributions
- The paper recommends that defenses be rigorously benchmarked against adaptive attacks, even for simple definitions like the Purple Problem. This prevents a false sense of security.

- It highlights output filtering as an important baseline for language model security, owing to its reliability in enforcing definitions.

- The key insight is that progress on language model security fundamentally relies on better definitions. The paper contends innovation should focus more on this rather than enforcement.

In summary, the paper makes a strong case that language model security research should prioritize developing methods for precisely defining unsafe behaviors over innovations in enforcement algorithms. It supports this using experiments revealing deficiencies in current defenses even for very simple definitions of unsafe outputs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that improving definitions of unsafe language model outputs is more important for security than innovating on enforcement mechanisms, as shown by attacks breaking defenses even for the simple problem of preventing "purple" generations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is arguing that the key challenge in defending against language model attacks ("jailbreaks") lies in obtaining a good definition of what constitutes unsafe or dangerous model responses, rather than innovating on enforcement strategies. 

To support this position, the paper shows that current enforcement methods like fine-tuning models or filtering inputs fail to prevent unsafe outputs even for an extremely simple and well-defined problem of preventing the model from saying "purple". In contrast, a method like output filtering is perfectly robust but only as good as the underlying definition. 

The paper uses the "Purple Problem" as a case study to demonstrate fundamental limitations of enforcement techniques. The key recommendations are to rigorously benchmark defenses against adaptive attacks and simple test problems, recognize that enforcement cannot fully address deficiencies in definition, and shift more research effort towards developing better specifications of unsafe behaviors. Overall, it argues that progress on language model security fundamentally requires better definitions over better methods to enforce existing flawed definitions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Jailbreaking attacks - Attacks designed to elicit unsafe/undesirable responses from language models
- Defenses against jailbreaking - Methods to prevent language models from generating unsafe content
- Definition of unsafe outputs - Characterizing what kinds of model outputs should be considered unsafe
- Enforcement of definitions - Techniques to ensure a language model adheres to a definition of unsafe outputs
- Purple Problem - A simple definition of unsafe outputs as those containing the word "purple" 
- Fine-tuning models - Using reinforcement learning or supervised learning to adjust model weights to enforce safety
- Input filtering - Preprocessing input prompts before passing them to the model 
- Output filtering - Postprocessing model outputs to filter unsafe generations
- Adaptive attacks - Attacks that are aware of and designed to bypass a particular defense
- Defense success rate (DSR) - Metric for measuring a defense's ability to prevent unsafe outputs

The key positions argued in the paper relate to focusing more research effort on better defining unsafe behaviors rather than just developing better enforcement mechanisms.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper advocates focusing research efforts on improving definitions of unsafe model behavior rather than enforcement mechanisms. What are some promising ways researchers could work to develop better definitions of unsafe outputs? What types of data or processes could help?

2. The paper shows that current enforcement methods fail to prevent simple "purple" outputs. Do you think adapting these methods or developing new enforcement techniques could lead to security against broader, more complex safety issues? Why or why not? 

3. The authors use post-processing via output filtering as a robust baseline for security. What are the limitations of output filtering in practice when dealing with more subjective safety standards? How can these limitations be addressed?

4. The Purple Problem aims to evaluate defenses using a simple, well-defined safety standard. What other clearly specified safety challenges could serve as good benchmarks for testing jailbreaking defenses? What properties would make them effective?

5. The paper hypothesizes that gaps in an imperfect safety definition would persist across different enforcement methods. Do you agree? Could certain enforcement mechanisms potentially help smooth deficiencies in a safety definition? Why or why not?  

6. Adapting attacks to known defenses is shown to easily break systems on the Purple Problem. How do you think the arms race between attacks and defenses will play out in practice? Will adaptations consistently reveal defense vulnerabilities?

7. The work does adaptive attacks in a white-box threat model with full knowledge of defenses. How do you think black-box attacks would differ in the context of this work? Would they be more or less effective in surfacing vulnerabilities? 

8. The paper argues that input filtering is fundamentally limited in its capability for enforcement. Do you think any input preprocessing methods could reliably detect or deter attackers in an unconstrained input space? Why or why not?

9. Practical language models will balance tradeoffs between security and metrics like usefulness. How can researchers design experiments that help better characterize how defenses are negotiating this tradeoff? What metrics beyond security should be considered?  

10. The authors recommend mixing output filtering with other enforcement mechanisms to help address downsides like computational overhead. What hybrid systems seem most promising to balance the strengths and weaknesses of different enforcement approaches?
