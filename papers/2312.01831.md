# [Equivariant plug-and-play image reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01831)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a simple yet effective strategy to stabilize and improve the performance of algorithms that rely on implicit denoising priors, such as plug-and-play (PnP) and regularization by denoising (RED). The key idea is to enforce approximate equivariance of the denoiser to certain transformations like rotations and translations by randomly applying a transformation to the denoiser's input and the inverse transformation to its output at each iteration. This equivariant denoiser enjoys beneficial theoretical properties like a more symmetric Jacobian and smaller Lipschitz constant. Experiments across problems like image deblurring, super-resolution, and MRI reconstruction with various state-of-the-art denoisers demonstrate that the proposed equivariant approach significantly enhances stability and reconstruction quality compared to non-equivariant counterparts. The gains come at negligible computational overhead without retraining the denoiser or changing the algorithm. Limitations still exist as the method can still diverge or hallucinate artifacts in some cases. Overall, it offers a simple plug-and-play strategy to stabilize a wide range of algorithms exploiting implicit denoising priors.
