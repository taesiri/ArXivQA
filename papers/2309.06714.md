# [MPI-Flow: Learning Realistic Optical Flow with Multiplane Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06714)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate realistic optical flow datasets from real-world images to improve the performance of learning-based optical flow estimation models?The key hypothesis is that using multiplane images (MPIs) to synthesize novel view images and optical flows from single-view real images can produce more realistic datasets compared to prior methods. This increased realism in the training data can then improve the generalization of learning-based models to real-world optical flow tasks.In particular, the paper investigates:- How to adapt MPI rendering techniques to jointly synthesize realistic novel view images along with corresponding optical flow maps.- How to model independent object motion in addition to camera motion to improve motion realism in the generated datasets. - How to handle occlusions and stitching artifacts when merging novel views with independent object motions.The central goal is developing an MPI-based framework called MPI-Flow that can take single-view real images and produce realistic datasets with paired images and optical flows to improve supervised training. The paper aims to demonstrate MPI-Flow can outperform existing dataset generation techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called MPI-Flow to generate realistic optical flow datasets from single-view real-world images using multiplane images (MPIs). The key points are:- They propose to use MPI representation to synthesize realistic novel view images from a single image. The MPI contains multiple RGBÎ± planes with color, density and depth predicted by neural networks. The novel view image is rendered using volume rendering on the MPI planes. - To generate corresponding optical flow maps, they compute optical flow for each MPI plane using camera matrices and plane depths. The final optical flow map is also rendered using volume rendering to match the novel view image.- To model realistic motions, they propose an independent object motion module to separate camera and object motions. Different virtual motions are applied to static scene and dynamic objects when generating flows. - They also propose a depth-aware inpainting module to merge rendered views of static and dynamic parts. It removes unnatural occlusions and holes.- Experiments show their MPI-Flow framework can generate more realistic datasets than previous methods. It also leads to state-of-the-art performance when used to train supervised and unsupervised optical flow learning methods.In summary, the main contribution is using MPI for high quality optical flow dataset generation from single images, with realistic image and motion modeling. This allows creating large-scale datasets to train optical flow networks with better real-world performance.
