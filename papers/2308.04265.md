# [FLIRT: Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04265)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we automatically and efficiently test AI systems such as text-to-image and text-to-text models for vulnerabilities that could lead to generating unsafe or inappropriate content?

The authors propose an automated "red teaming" framework called FLIRT (Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming) that uses in-context learning and a feedback loop to efficiently generate adversarial prompts aimed at triggering target models into generating unsafe content. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) FLIRT will be more efficient and effective at exposing vulnerabilities in models compared to prior red teaming methods that require a lot of data generation or fine-tuning. 

2) FLIRT's in-context learning approach will allow generating diverse and effective adversarial prompts by iteratively updating prompts based on model feedback.

3) The proposed attack strategies in FLIRT will allow controlling different objectives like diversity and toxicity to expose a wider range of vulnerabilities.

4) FLIRT will be effective at red teaming both text-to-image and text-to-text models by triggering them to generate unsafe/inappropriate content.

In summary, the central research question is how to efficiently and automatically red team AI systems to expose vulnerabilities, with the hypothesis that the proposed FLIRT framework will achieve this through iterative in-context learning and adaptive attack strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an automatic red teaming framework called FLIRT (Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming) for evaluating and exposing vulnerabilities in generative models, in particular text-to-image and text-to-text models. The key ideas are:

- Using in-context learning in a feedback loop to iteratively learn better adversarial prompts that can trigger unsafe/undesired behavior in the target generative model. 

- Proposing different in-context attack strategies (FIFO, LIFO, scoring, scoring-LIFO) that the red team model can use to craft adversarial prompts. These strategies allow controlling different objectives like attack effectiveness, diversity of prompts, and low toxicity.

- Showing FLIRT can effectively red team and expose vulnerabilities in various text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion and safe variants, significantly outperforming prior automated red teaming approach. It can also control toxicity of prompts to bypass filters.

- Demonstrating FLIRT can be applied to red team text-to-text models as well, achieving higher attack success than prior work.

Overall, the key contribution is presenting a novel automated framework for red teaming generative models using in-context learning and different attack strategies in a feedback loop, and showing its effectiveness across text-to-image and text-to-text settings. The flexibility of FLIRT in controlling different objectives and transferring attacks makes it an important contribution for evaluating model vulnerabilities.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in the field of red teaming generative models:

- It proposes a novel framework called FLIRT (Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming) for automatically generating adversarial prompts to test generative models. This is different from prior work like Red Team ChatGPT which relies on manual human curation of prompts. 

- The FLIRT framework utilizes in-context learning in a feedback loop to iteratively update prompts based on model responses. This sets it apart from prior approaches that sample prompts randomly or use pre-defined prompt templates.

- FLIRT introduces several in-context attack strategies like FIFO, LIFO, scoring, and scoring-LIFO. These allow controlling different objectives like effectiveness, diversity, and toxicity when generating prompts. Other papers have not explored similar sophisticated strategies.

- Experiments are conducted on multiple generative models - both text-to-image (Stable Diffusion variants) and text-to-text (GPT Neo). Comparisons are provided to baseline approaches like stochastic few shot prompting. Most prior work focused only on textual models.

- The attack strategies in FLIRT achieve higher attack success rates compared to baselines like stochastic few shot. For example, 80% for Stable Diffusion vs 33% for stochastic few shot.

- FLIRT is shown to be effective at controlling toxicity and bypassing content moderation filters. This demonstrates how it can expose different vulnerabilities compared to prior work.

- Attack transferability between models is analyzed. Most papers have not studied transferability of red teaming attacks across models.

In summary, this paper introduces a new in-context learning based framework for automated red teaming of generative models across modalities. The sophisticated strategies and thorough evaluation sets it apart from existing literature. The feedback loop approach appears more effective than prior random or manual strategies.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper: 

The paper proposes an automated red teaming framework called Feedback Loop In-Context Red Teaming (FLIRT) for evaluating vulnerabilities in generative AI models. FLIRT uses an iterative in-context learning approach where a red language model generates adversarial prompts aimed at triggering unsafe content generation from a target model. The framework incorporates a feedback loop where the safety of the content generated by the target model in response to the red model's prompts is evaluated using classifiers. Based on this feedback, the red model updates its in-context prompts to generate more effective attacks in subsequent iterations. Experiments demonstrate FLIRT can effectively expose vulnerabilities in text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and text-to-text models, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. The framework allows incorporating different in-context attack strategies and controlling objectives like diversity and toxicity. Overall, FLIRT provides an automated way to red team AI systems to test their safety and robustness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new framework called Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming (FLIRT) for automatically testing and exposing vulnerabilities in generative AI models. As generative models like text-to-image and text-to-text models are being deployed, it is important to evaluate their safety and robustness. FLIRT uses a red teaming approach where a "red" language model generates adversarial prompts aimed at triggering unsafe outputs from a target generative model. It does this through an iterative in-context learning process where the red model updates its prompts based on feedback on whether the target model generated unsafe outputs. Different strategies are proposed for how the red model can update its prompts in this feedback loop to generate diverse and effective attacks.

The authors evaluate FLIRT on text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and find it is significantly more effective at generating unsafe images compared to baseline approaches, even when safety measures are added to the models. Experiments also show FLIRT can control tradeoffs like diversity of prompts versus attack effectiveness. Finally, FLIRT is shown to work for red teaming text-to-text models as well, generating more toxic responses. The framework demonstrates the need for comprehensive robustness testing and safety measures when deploying generative AI systems. Overall, FLIRT provides an automated way to probe vulnerabilities in generative models to aid in developing safer and more robust systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel automated red teaming framework called Feedback Loop In-context Red Teaming (FLIRT) for evaluating and exposing vulnerabilities in generative AI models. FLIRT uses iterative in-context learning in a feedback loop, where a red language model generates adversarial prompts aimed at triggering unsafe content generation from the target model. The framework evaluates the generated content using safety classifiers and based on whether unsafe content was generated, it provides feedback to the red language model. The red language model uses this feedback to update its in-context exemplar prompts according to different proposed strategies, in order to generate new and diverse adversarial prompts. This iterative process repeats for multiple rounds. Through experiments on text-to-image and text-text models, the authors demonstrate that FLIRT is effective in exposing vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art generative models.
