# [FLex: Joint Pose and Dynamic Radiance Fields Optimization for Stereo   Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Reconstructing endoscopic scenes is important for applications like post-surgery analysis and surgical training, but is challenging due to non-rigid deformations, long recording times, and difficulty in determining camera poses.
- Prior works rely on external pose measurement tools or are limited to short sequences, static cameras, or small deformations. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose FLex, a novel neural radiance fields (NeRF) based method for 4D reconstruction of long, pose-free stereo endoscopic videos with deforming tissue and camera motion.

- Key ideas:
  - Scene is divided into overlapping local 4D NeRF models that are progressively optimized to enable scaling to long sequences.
  - Jointly optimizes each local model's radiance field and its camera poses from scratch in a coarse-to-fine manner. 
  - Employs losses like photometric, depth, optical flow to supervise pose and scene optimization.

Main Contributions:
- First NeRF method to enable joint optimization of pose and scene reconstruction for endoscopic video, eliminating reliance on external pose measurement tools.

- Significantly improves sequence length handling capability compared to prior art, with experiments on up to 5,000 frames.

- Achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis results on the StereoMIS dataset while maintaining competitive camera trajectory accuracy.

- The progressive localization and mapping strategy paves way for more practical and scalable usage of NeRFs for long, deforming endoscopic recordings to enable better surgical analysis and training.
