# [Accelerating LLM Inference with Staged Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04623)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to accelerate inference for large language models (LLMs) in small-batch, on-device scenarios. Specifically, the authors aim to improve the efficiency of autoregressive decoding, which suffers from low arithmetic intensity and thus poor compute utilization. Their key hypothesis is that speculative decoding techniques can be substantially improved upon to increase decoding throughput in local LLM inference.

The main innovations proposed are:

1) Restructuring the speculative batch as a tree instead of a single sequence. This increases the expected number of tokens processed per batch and reduces generation costs. 

2) Adding a second stage of speculative decoding to accelerate the draft model in addition to accelerating the oracle model. 

Overall, the paper hypothesizes that these techniques can significantly increase the throughput of small-batch LLM decoding while perfectly preserving output quality, enabling more performant and private on-device experiences. The experiments aim to validate these hypothesized performance improvements.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel algorithm called "staged speculative decoding" to accelerate inference of large language models (LLMs) in small-batch, on-device scenarios. 

The key ideas are:

1. Restructuring the speculative batch as a tree of possible token sequences, rather than a single sequence. This reduces generation costs, increases expected tokens per batch, and improves parallelism. 

2. Adding a second stage of speculative decoding, where the draft model is itself speculatively decoded to further improve performance. 

Together, these improvements allow the authors to reduce single-batch decoding latency by 3.16x for a 762M parameter GPT-2 model, while perfectly preserving output quality.

The authors motivate this work by the need for low-latency, personalized, and private LLM inference. They aim to democratize access to powerful AI by enabling efficient on-device execution. Overall, this paper focuses on an engineering contribution to practically accelerate small-batch LLM inference without compromising output quality.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper proposes a novel algorithm called staged speculative decoding to accelerate inference for large language models in small-batch, on-device scenarios. The key ideas are restructuring the speculative batch as a tree to reduce costs and add more tokens, and adding a second stage of speculative decoding to further improve performance. The methods provide a 3.16x speedup for single-batch decoding latency with a 762M parameter GPT-2 model while perfectly preserving output quality.

In summary, the paper introduces staged speculative decoding to significantly accelerate small-batch, on-device inference for large language models without any loss in output quality.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on accelerating large language model inference:

- The main contribution is improving upon prior work on speculative decoding. The paper builds off ideas like using a smaller "draft" model to try to predict tokens ahead of the full model (as in DeepMind's recent work) and structuring batches as trees rather than linear sequences. So it is an incremental advance rather than proposing something completely new.

- However, the results seem quite strong. The staged speculative decoding approach provides a 3.16x speedup over standard decoding with the 762M parameter GPT-2 model. This is a bigger gain than typically seen from speculative decoding alone. 

- The focus on accelerating small-batch on-device inference differentiates this work from a lot of other LLM optimization research, which looks at large-batch server-side deployment. So it is tackling a problem setting that has received less attention.

- The proposed techniques could likely combine well with other optimizations like quantization and novel attention mechanisms. So it seems complementary to many other lines of work.

- The experiments are on fairly small models (up to 762M parameters). It's not clear if the benefits will scale up smoothly to models with billions of parameters. Testing on larger models would help situate this approach.

Overall, this appears to be a novel contribution that pushes speculative decoding significantly forward, achieving impressive empirical gains for on-device LLM inference. It addresses an important problem setting and the results seem competitive with or better than prior work. Testing the limits of these ideas on very large models would be interesting future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest a few potential future research directions:

- Running with larger models would likely yield even greater performance boosts while still fitting on-device. With 8-bit quantization, it should be possible to fit 20B models on consumer GPUs in small-batch, allowing for an additional stage of speculation. (20B -> 1B -> 50M -> N-gram)

- Investigating better lowest-level draft models could also improve performance - models which perform better than N-gram models but still run in <10Î¼s. 

- They speculate it may be possible to speculatively sample with T>0 even faster by generating the multinomial CDFs first, and then using this sequence to help choose the tokens to assemble into the full batch. For example, if the multinomial CDF sampled is 0.99, it may be best to only include in the batch the draft model's fifth through tenth most likely tokens.

- Profiling shows their implementation has 35% overhead from the Python infrastructure, which could be reduced by a more efficient implementation or amortized over larger models.

In summary, the main future directions are exploring larger models, better low-level draft models, more efficient sampling techniques, and reducing implementation overhead. The key goal is pushing the techniques to even greater on-device performance for LLMs while retaining output quality.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel algorithm called staged speculative decoding to accelerate inference for large language models (LLMs) in small-batch, on-device scenarios. The key ideas are:

1. Restructure the speculative batch for the oracle model as a tree of possible token sequences rather than a single sequence. This reduces generation costs, increases expected tokens per batch, and improves parallelism. 

2. Add a second stage of speculative decoding by also using a fast draft model to accelerate decoding of the first draft model. 

Together, these improvements enable the paper to reduce single-batch decoding latency by 3.16x for a 762M parameter GPT-2 model while perfectly preserving output quality. The paper aims to enable faster, more personalized, and more private LLM experiences by optimizing local inference.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a novel algorithm called staged speculative decoding to accelerate inference with large language models (LLMs) in small-batch, on-device scenarios. The key idea is to improve upon previous work on speculative decoding, which uses a fast draft model to predict tokens that are then fed in batch to the full model. The paper makes two main contributions. First, it restructures the speculative batch as a tree of possible token sequences rather than a single sequence. This reduces generation costs and increases expected tokens per batch. Second, it applies speculative decoding to the draft model as well, adding a second stage of speculation. Together, these two innovations provide significant speedups in decoding latency while perfectly preserving output quality. Experiments with a 762M parameter GPT-2 model show an average 3.16x speedup over standard decoding.

In summary, this paper makes important progress on enabling fast, localized inference for large language models. Staged speculative decoding could help overcome barriers to real-time interactivity, personalization, and privacy that arise from relying solely on cloud-based LLM deployment. The techniques optimize decoding throughput by converting sequential token generation into maximally parallel execution across speculation stages. Beyond the concrete speedups demonstrated, this work also highlights the broader potential for multi-stage speculative techniques to enable performant on-device LLM applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel algorithm called staged speculative decoding to accelerate inference for large language models (LLMs) in small-batch, on-device scenarios. The key idea is to use a faster but less accurate draft model to speculatively predict multiple future tokens that are then fed as a batch into the full oracle model. This converts sequential token-by-token decoding into batched parallel decoding, improving compute utilization. 

The main innovations are:

1) Restructuring the speculative batch into a tree rather than a single sequence, which reduces generation costs and increases expected tokens per batch. 

2) Adding a second stage of speculative decoding to the draft model itself, accelerating its generation of speculative batches.

Together, these improvements enable 3.16x lower latency for single-batch decoding compared to standard methods, without degrading output quality. The approach targets settings like real-time interactivity on devices where small-batch inference suffers from low arithmetic intensity and memory bandwidth limits performance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of accelerating inference for large language models (LLMs) in low-latency, small-batch settings. Specifically, it focuses on improving the speed of autoregressive decoding, which is the slowest part of LLM inference due to its low arithmetic intensity when run with small batch sizes. 

The key questions the paper tries to answer are:

- How can we accelerate the autoregressive decoding phase of LLM inference when operating with small batch sizes, as is required for low-latency applications? 

- Can we do this while perfectly preserving the output quality and distribution of the original LLM?

So in summary, the paper is targeting the problem of slow LLM inference latency in interactive small-batch settings, with a focus on accelerating the decoding phase while retaining perfect output fidelity.
