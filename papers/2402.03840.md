# [Belief Scene Graphs: Expanding Partial Scenes with Objects through   Computation of Expectation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robotic systems currently lack the capability to reason and extract high-level information from a scene based on partial/uncertain data. This limits their ability to efficiently plan tasks by predicting likely locations of needed objects.

- Existing methods for scene understanding like 3D scene graphs do not incorporate the concept of "expectation" (beliefs about presence of objects) which humans leverage for planning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces "Belief Scene Graphs" which expand partial 3D scene graphs by adding expected objects ("blind nodes") based on correlation information learnt from data.

- A novel Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based model called CECI is proposed to learn correlation between objects from a dataset of 3D scene graphs. This is used to predict probability distributions of expected objects.

- Blind nodes representing expected objects are added to incomplete 3D scene graphs to create Belief Scene Graphs. This enables optimized planning by prioritizing search in rooms likely to contain needed objects.

Main Contributions:
- Establishing the novel concept of Belief Scene Graphs to incorporate expectation into 3D scene representations.

- Proposing the CECI GCN model to computationally estimate expectation of objects by learning correlations.

- Methodology to generate a 3D scene graph dataset from semantically labelled spaces.

- Demonstrating enhanced performance of Belief Scene Graphs over 3D Scene Graphs for task planning in simulation and real robotic experiment.

In summary, the paper presents a way to expand incomplete 3D scene graphs by incorporating expectation of objects, to enable more efficient planning for robotic systems using partial/uncertain information. The proposed Belief Scene Graphs and CECI model for learning correlations are the main innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the concept of Belief Scene Graphs, which incorporate expectation into 3D scene graphs through learned correlations, enabling enhanced high-level reasoning and task planning with partial environment information.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing the novel concept of "Belief Scene Graphs", which are extensions of partial 3D scene graphs that incorporate expectations about additional objects that could be present. This enables more efficient high-level task planning with incomplete information.

2) Developing a graph-based learning methodology called "Computation of Expectation based on Correlation Information" (CECI) to compute expectations about finding certain objects given a partial 3D scene graph. This involves designing a novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network architecture.

3) Presenting a methodology to generate a dataset of 3D scene graphs from semantically annotated real-world 3D spaces, which is then used to train the CECI model.

4) Establishing the concept of "blind nodes" in Belief Scene Graphs which represent expected objects, allowing reasoning and task planning capabilities beyond what is possible with classical 3D scene graphs.

5) Validating the proposed approach on an object search task in simulation, showing improved performance over classical methods, as well as testing the CECI method's ability to predict unseen objects and match human common sense in a real-world environment.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the Belief Scene Graph concept and associated learning methods to reason about and incorporate expectations into scene graphs to enable more efficient planning.
