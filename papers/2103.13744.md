# [KiloNeRF: Speeding up Neural Radiance Fields with Thousands of Tiny MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13744)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be: Can real-time rendering of neural radiance fields be achieved by using thousands of small MLPs instead of one large MLP to represent the scene? 

The key ideas are:

- NeRF represents scenes using a single large MLP, which leads to slow rendering. 

- This paper proposes to use many smaller MLPs instead, where each MLP only represents a part of the scene. This allows using simpler/faster networks.

- By combining this "divide and conquer" strategy with optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination, they aim to accelerate NeRF rendering by orders of magnitude without losing visual quality.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that scene decomposition and smaller networks can massively speed up neural radiance field rendering, while maintaining visual fidelity. The paper seems to present experiments validating this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to accelerate the rendering speed of NeRF while maintaining high visual quality. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs to represent a NeRF, instead of a single large MLP, can significantly speed up rendering without sacrificing visual fidelity.

The key hypothesis is that by spatially decomposing the scene into a grid and assigning a small MLP to each cell, the networks only need to represent a small region of space rather than the entire scene. This allows using smaller, faster-to-evaluate networks while still capturing fine details through the composite representation. 

The paper tests this hypothesis by developing KiloNeRF, which adopts a grid of tiny MLPs. Through experiments on standard NeRF datasets, the authors demonstrate that KiloNeRF achieves orders of magnitude speedup in rendering compared to the original NeRF and a strong baseline (NSVF), with similar or sometimes better visual quality.

In summary, the central research question is how to accelerate NeRF rendering via a composite scene representation while maintaining quality. The key hypothesis is that decomposing a scene into thousands of tiny MLPs can unlock significant speedups.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is using thousands of tiny MLPs to represent a neural radiance field instead of a single large MLP like in the original NeRF model. This allows for a significant speedup in rendering novel views without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, the key points are:

- They divide the scene into a 3D grid and assign a separate small MLP to each grid cell. Since each MLP only needs to model a small part of the scene, the capacity can be much lower compared to NeRF's single MLP for the full scene.

- They show that naively training from scratch can lead to artifacts. Therefore, they propose a training procedure involving first distilling knowledge from a pretrained NeRF teacher model. 

- By combining the tiny MLPs with optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination, they achieve speedups of over 2000x compared to NeRF while maintaining high rendering quality.

- They provide an efficient implementation to concurrently evaluate thousands of tiny MLPs, which is key for realizing the speedups.

So in summary, the main contribution is using spatial decomposition and distillation to train thousands of tiny MLPs to represent a neural radiance field for drastically faster rendering without quality loss. This could be an important step towards making neural rendering practical.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting KiloNeRF, a method to significantly speed up neural radiance fields (NeRFs) by using thousands of small multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of one large MLP. The key ideas are:

- Decompose the scene into a 3D grid of cells, with each cell handled by its own tiny MLP network. This allows using much smaller networks compared to the large MLP in vanilla NeRF. 

- Use distillation to train the tiny MLPs to match the outputs of a pre-trained teacher NeRF model. This avoids artifacts that occur when training from scratch.

- Apply optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination to further accelerate rendering.

By splitting up the scene and using smaller networks, KiloNeRF achieves rendering speedups of over 1000x compared to NeRF while maintaining high visual quality. The method enables real-time rendering of neural radiance fields on consumer GPUs.

In summary, the main contribution is a divide-and-conquer strategy to accelerate NeRF rendering by using thousands of tiny MLPs combined with distillation and rendering optimizations, unlocking real-time performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in novel view synthesis:

- The key innovation is using thousands of small MLPs to represent a neural radiance field instead of a single large MLP like in the original NeRF work. This divide-and-conquer strategy allows for much faster rendering speeds while maintaining visual quality.

- Other methods like NSVF and DeRF have also tried to speed up NeRF rendering, but this paper shows greater speedups (2548x over NeRF and over 100x over NSVF). The regular grid of MLPs is a simpler yet more effective approach compared to NSVF's single conditioned MLP or DeRF's irregular voxel grid.

- The paper builds directly on the NeRF technique but makes an important contribution in addressing NeRF's main weakness - slow rendering. Other NeRF extensions like NeRF-W, GIRAFFE etc focused on other aspects.

- Concurrent works like AutoInt and DONeRF reduce the number of sampling points along a ray. Those are orthogonal and potentially complementary to this work's approach of faster network evaluation per point.

- The method still shares NeRF's strengths like novel view synthesis quality and low storage requirements. It does not require discrete voxels or mesh/point cloud preprocessing.

- A limitation is the assumption of bounded scenes as in NSVF. Extending to unbounded scenes would likely require more optimizations to manage memory.

Overall, I would say this paper makes a very meaningful contribution by proposed an effective way to accelerate NeRF rendering by orders of magnitude. The decomposition into small MLPs is simple but outperforms prior techniques. It addresses a major weakness of NeRF while retaining its benefits. The results are very promising for enabling practical neural view synthesis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents KiloNeRF, a method to accelerate neural radiance field (NeRF) rendering by using thousands of small multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of one large MLP. Here are some key ways it compares to other NeRF acceleration research:

- It is similar to DeRF in using multiple smaller networks, but KiloNeRF uses a simpler regular 3D grid rather than irregular Voronoi decomposition. KiloNeRF achieves much higher (over 100x) speedups than DeRF.

- It is complementary to methods like AutoInt and DONeRF that reduce the number of samples per ray. KiloNeRF focuses on faster network evaluation per sample. Combining these approaches could further improve performance. 

- Other works like NGV and NR-NeRF accelerate rendering by converting the neural representation to a discrete one after training. KiloNeRF retains the continuous representation. The discrete methods require more GPU memory which may limit scalability.

- Compared to general NeRF optimizations like neural sparse voxel fields (NSVF), KiloNeRF achieves higher speedups due to the smaller per-network capacity. It also combines optimizations like empty space skipping.

Overall, KiloNeRF demonstrates a simple but effective way of harnessing multiple small MLPs to massively accelerate NeRF rendering, while retaining its continuous representation nature and quality. The speedups are much higher than prior works, highlighting the potential of this divide-and-conquer approach. Combining KiloNeRF with complementary sample reduction techniques could enable real-time high resolution NeRF rendering.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling the approach to a higher number of smaller networks to achieve further speedups for real-time rendering of high-resolution images. However, this would also increase memory consumption, so they suggest using memory-efficient data structures to allow loading only the networks near surfaces.

- Combining KiloNeRF with other recent techniques like AutoInt or DONeRF that reduce the number of samples along each ray. This could lead to real-time rendering of high-res images. 

- Addressing the limitation of bounded scenes by using efficient data structures to represent larger/unbounded scenes with many networks while controlling memory usage.

- Applying the acceleration strategy more broadly to other neural function representations like implicit surfaces.

- Further optimization of the concurrent evaluation of thousands of tiny MLPs.

- Exploring distillation and regularization techniques to improve quality and avoid artifacts.

So in summary, the main future directions are around scaling to more networks and larger scenes, combining with other ray sampling optimizations, and improving training and inference efficiency.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

- Scaling KiloNeRF to an even higher number of smaller networks in order to achieve real-time rendering of high-resolution images. They suggest using memory-efficient data structures like sparse voxel octrees to represent the networks only near surfaces to mitigate the storage costs.

- Combining KiloNeRF with other recent techniques like AutoInt or DONeRF that reduce the number of samples along each ray. This could lead to real-time rendering of high-res images.

- Addressing the limitation of bounded scenes by using data structures that allow representing larger/unbounded scenes without excessive memory costs. This could enable applications like rendering large outdoor scenes. 

- Applying the proposed divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy more broadly to other neural representation methods, like implicit surface models.

- Further speedups by improvements in the implementation, like fusing more steps of the rendering pipeline into a single GPU kernel.

So in summary, the main future directions are: scaling to more networks, combining with complementary ray sampling techniques, handling unbounded scenes, applying the approach to other neural representations, and implementation optimizations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes KiloNeRF, a method to accelerate the rendering speed of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by using thousands of tiny Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) instead of one large MLP. NeRF represents scenes using an MLP that outputs color and density values for any 3D position and viewing direction. However, querying this large MLP millions of times is slow. KiloNeRF divides the scene into a 3D grid, assigning a smaller MLP to each grid cell to represent just that part of the scene. This allows using smaller, faster networks. KiloNeRF is trained using teacher-student distillation to match the outputs of a pre-trained NeRF model, avoiding artifacts that occur when training from scratch. Additionally, empty space skipping and early ray termination are used to further accelerate rendering. In experiments, KiloNeRF achieves similar visual quality to NeRF and Neural Sparse Voxel Fields, while rendering up to 3000x faster. The method demonstrates that real-time rendering of Neural Radiance Fields is possible.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes KiloNeRF, a method to significantly accelerate the rendering speed of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without sacrificing visual quality. The key idea is to spatially decompose the scene into thousands of small 3D grid cells, with each cell represented by an independent Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. Since each tiny MLP only needs to model a small part of the scene, the capacity and computational requirements are greatly reduced compared to NeRF's single large MLP modeling the entire scene. To train this ensemble of networks properly, a teacher-student strategy is employed where first a regular NeRF model is trained that then provides supervision for training the thousands of smaller student networks to match the teacher's outputs. Finally, the KiloNeRF model is fine-tuned on the original images. 

Experiments demonstrate that KiloNeRF achieves a speedup of over 2000x compared to NeRF and around 100x compared to a strong baseline, while attaining the same visual quality. The efficiency gains are enabled by the smaller networks, and additionally by applying optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination. The storage overhead introduced by using thousands of networks instead of one is minor, since each tiny MLP only requires a small amount of parameters. The authors believe KiloNeRF is an important step towards making NeRFs practical for applications like virtual reality where real-time rendering is crucial. Limitations remain for very complex high-resolution scenes, but combination with other concurrent works is promising for achieving fully real-time performance also in those cases.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes KiloNeRF, a method to significantly speed up rendering of neural radiance fields (NeRFs). NeRFs can generate high quality novel views of a 3D scene, but rendering is slow as it requires querying a large neural network millions of times. KiloNeRF improves rendering speed by using thousands of tiny multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of one large MLP to represent the scene. Each tiny MLP is only responsible for a small region of the scene, so it can have low capacity and be fast to evaluate. By splitting up the scene representation across many networks, KiloNeRF achieves orders of magnitude faster rendering without sacrificing visual quality.

The key ideas of KiloNeRF are: 1) Decompose the scene into a 3D grid of cells and assign an independent small MLP to each cell to represent that region 2) Use a training procedure involving knowledge distillation from a teacher NeRF model and fine-tuning to avoid artifacts while retaining quality 3) Employ optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination to further reduce rendering cost. Experiments demonstrate KiloNeRF renders up to 2548x faster than NeRF at similar visual quality on bounded scene datasets. Limitations are the memory overhead of thousands of networks and restriction to bounded scenes. But overall, KiloNeRF is a promising step towards practical neural view synthesis.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes KiloNeRF, a method to significantly accelerate neural radiance field (NeRF) rendering by replacing the single large multilayer perceptron (MLP) used in NeRF with thousands of small independent MLPs. Each MLP is assigned to represent a part of the scene corresponding to a 3D grid cell. Since each tiny MLP only needs to model a small region, smaller networks with fewer layers and units can be used, enabling much faster evaluation. Further speedups are achieved through empty space skipping using an occupancy grid and early ray termination. A key finding is that naively training thousands of small networks leads to artifacts, so a multi-stage training procedure is proposed: first a normal NeRF is trained as teacher, then the KiloNeRF student networks are distilled to match the teacher outputs, and finally fine-tuned on images. This allows retaining NeRF's high quality while accelerating rendering by three orders of magnitude.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces KiloNeRF, a method to significantly speed up the rendering time of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without sacrificing visual quality. NeRF represents scenes using a single neural network, which leads to slow rendering. KiloNeRF instead represents a scene with thousands of tiny multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) arranged in a 3D grid. Each MLP is only responsible for a small region of space, so smaller networks with fewer parameters can be used, speeding up rendering. KiloNeRF is first pretrained by distilling knowledge from a teacher NeRF model into the thousands of student MLPs to provide a good initialization. The tiny MLPs are then finetuned on images using NeRF's volume rendering loss. On test scenes, KiloNeRF achieves 2548x speedup over NeRF while attaining similar or better image quality metrics. The speedup comes from the smaller MLPs and optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination. KiloNeRF demonstrates real-time rendering is possible for NeRFs through a simple divide-and-conquer approach, enabling applications like virtual reality, while retaining NeRF's benefits of high quality novel views and low storage costs.

The paper proposes KiloNeRF, a method to significantly speed up neural radiance field (NeRF) rendering by representing a scene with thousands of tiny multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) instead of a single large MLP like in NeRF. Each tiny MLP only needs to represent a small region of the scene, allowing smaller networks to be used which are faster to evaluate. The scene is divided into a 3D grid, with each grid cell assigned an independent tiny MLP. To train this representation, first a regular NeRF model is trained and used as a teacher to distill knowledge into the thousands of student MLPs through mimicking outputs. The student MLPs are then fine-tuned on the training images. With distillation and other optimizations like empty space skipping and early ray termination, KiloNeRF achieves orders of magnitude speedup in rendering compared to NeRF, without loss in visual quality. For example, on a Lego scene KiloNeRF renders an 800x800 image in 26ms, 2548x faster than NeRF, enabling real-time rendering. The key ideas are decomposing the scene into many tiny MLPs so each only needs to represent a small region, distillation to effectively train this representation, and optimizations like empty space skipping to maximize speedup.
