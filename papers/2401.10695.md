# [LangBridge: Multilingual Reasoning Without Multilingual Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Language models (LMs) like Llama 2 perform poorly on reasoning tasks like math or coding when tested in low-resource languages outside of English. This is because most LMs are pretrained on English-heavy corpora.
- Specialized reasoning LMs like MetaMath and Orca 2 are adapted from Llama 2 weights and suffer from the same issue.
- Translating reasoning datasets to other languages and retraining is unscalable. Existing multilingual LMs also lack reasoning abilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce LangBridge, a novel zero-shot approach to adapt LMs for multilingual reasoning without multilingual supervision.
- Leverage a multilingual encoder (mT5) and introduce a small trainable layer between mT5 and the reasoning LM specialized in English.
- Align representations using only English data based on the observation that mT5 produces moderately language-agnostic representations.
- Show LangBridge enhances reasoning in math, coding and logical reasoning across 11 languages.

Main Contributions:
- Propose LangBridge, a simple yet effective zero-shot approach to impart multilingual reasoning abilities in LMs using just English supervision.
- Show strong gains over baselines on benchmarks like MGSM, HumanEval-MT and BBH-BN across multiple languages.
- Match or exceed specialized reasoning models adapted with multilingual data.
- Provide analysis attributing LangBridge's effectiveness to language-neutral characteristics of mT5 representations.
- Enable extending state-of-the-art English reasoning models to low-resource languages easily.

In summary, LangBridge enables adapting reasoning LMs for multilingual use without needing translated data, through a model alignment technique capitalizing on multilingual encoders' language-agnostic representations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces LangBridge, a zero-shot approach to adapt language models for multilingual reasoning tasks without requiring multilingual supervision, by bridging a multilingual encoder model with a reasoning-specialized model using minimal trainable parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing LangBridge, a novel approach to adapt language models to solve multilingual reasoning tasks without explicitly training them on multilingual data. 

Specifically, LangBridge operates by "bridging" two independently pretrained models - one specialized in understanding multiple languages (e.g. mT5 encoder) and one specialized in reasoning (e.g. Orca 2). It introduces a small number of trainable parameters between these two models to align them.

Although trained only on English data, LangBridge is shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models across multiple languages, especially low-resource languages. This allows adapting reasoning-specialized LMs like MetaMath or Orca 2 to support more languages without needing translated training data.

So in summary, the key contribution is a zero-shot method to impart multilingual reasoning abilities to LMs by leveraging the language-neutral representations from a multilingual encoder. This helps narrow the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- LangBridge - The name of the proposed approach to adapt language models for multilingual reasoning without needing multilingual supervision. Operates by bridging two models, one specialized in understanding multiple languages (e.g. mT5 encoder) and one specialized in reasoning (e.g. Orca 2).

- Zero-shot multilingual adaptation - LangBridge aligns the two models using only English data for training, but generalizes to enhance performance on multiple languages at test time without seeing multilingual training data. Resembles zero-shot cross-lingual transfer approaches. 

- Mathematical reasoning - One of the main task categories used to evaluate LangBridge, by applying it to the MetaMath model for mathematics. Also tested on multilingual math word problem benchmarks like MGSM.

- Code completion - Another evaluation category for LangBridge by applying it to the Code Llama model and evaluating on multilingual code completion.

- Logical reasoning - Third main category for evaluating LangBridge by applying it to the Orca 2 model and testing on multilingual logical reasoning datasets.

- Multilingual representations - The efficacy of LangBridge is analyzed to be based on the language-agnostic characteristics of representations from multilingual encoder models like mT5.

- Low-resource languages - LangBridge is shown to enhance reasoning capabilities especially for underrepresented languages in model pretraining data, helping to mitigate the discrepancy between high-resource and low-resource language performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the LangBridge method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that the efficacy of LangBridge stems from the language-agnostic characteristics of multilingual representations. What evidence does the paper provide to support this hypothesis? How convincing is this evidence?

2. The paper aligns specialized language models (e.g. MetaMath, Code Llama) with multilingual encoders. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using specialized LMs versus more general LMs? How does the choice impact multilingual reasoning performance?  

3. LangBridge introduces minimal trainable parameters between the encoder and LM, keeping the LM frozen. What is the motivation behind this design choice? How sensitive are the results to freezing the LM versus allowing end-to-end fine-tuning?

4. The paper evaluates LangBridge on math, coding, and logical reasoning tasks. What characteristics of these tasks make the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer approach viable? Would the approach work as well for more open-ended language generation tasks?

5. Could the LangBridge approach be extended to even more languages by using an encoder with broader multilingual support? What practical challenges might limit the scalability to 100+ languages?  

6. The paper trains LangBridge models on English data only. What types of English training data would be most effective at facilitating transfer to other languages? Could curating the English data help boost performance further?

7. LangBridge improves performance on under-resourced languages much more drastically than high-resource ones. Why does this disparity exist? What modifications could further improve high-resource language performance?

8. Accidental translation cases reveal the model sometimes discerns the language despite language-agnostic representations. Is this behavior problematic? How prevalent is it across languages and does frequency correlate with representation language-neutrality?

9. How sensitive are the results to the choice of encoder model architecture, size, and pretraining technique? Could encoder enhancements like language-neutrality techniques improve LangBridge further?

10. The paper demonstrates LangBridge for reasoning tasks. Could the approach effectively impart multilingual abilities beyond reasoning to dialog, search, translation, etc.? What challenges might arise in these settings?
