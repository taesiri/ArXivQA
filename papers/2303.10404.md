# [MotionTrack: Learning Robust Short-term and Long-term Motions for   Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10404)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be how to develop a multi-object tracker that can maintain continuous trajectories for each target even in challenging scenarios with dense crowds and extreme occlusions. 

The key points are:

- The main challenge in multi-object tracking (MOT) is maintaining a continuous trajectory for each target between frames. Existing methods have difficulties in dense crowd scenes where motion patterns are complex, and when targets are occluded for long periods where appearance features change.

- The paper proposes MotionTrack, a tracking framework that learns robust short-term and long-term motions to associate trajectories across a range of distances. 

- For dense crowds, an Interaction Module is designed to model interactions between targets and estimate their complex motions. 

- For extreme occlusions, a Refind Module based on target history trajectories is proposed to re-identify lost targets after long periods.

- Experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, indicating MotionTrack's ability to maintain target identities even in challenging scenarios.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that learning robust short-term and long-term motion patterns can improve multi-object tracking performance in dense crowd and occlusion scenarios. The Interaction and Refind Modules are designed to address these challenges.
