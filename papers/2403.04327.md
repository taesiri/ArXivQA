# [ProMoAI: Process Modeling with Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "ProMoAI: Process Modeling with Generative AI":

Problem:
- Process modeling is important for analyzing and optimizing organizational workflows, but requires significant manual effort and expertise. 
- Traditional approaches are inaccessible to non-experts due to the need for specialized knowledge.
- There is a need for intuitive tools that can automatically generate process models from textual descriptions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ProMoAI, a novel tool that uses large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 for automated process model generation. 
- It employs advanced prompt engineering so LLMs can accurately interpret textual process descriptions and generate executable Python code to build process models using the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL).
- Validation rules and a secure execution environment ensure reliability. 
- An interactive loop allows users to provide feedback to refine the generated models.

Key Contributions:
- Automates the creation of BPMN and Petri net process models from textual descriptions using LLMs' natural language capabilities.
- Introduces innovative prompt design for guiding LLM-based process model generation.
- Allows non-experts to create complex process models without specialized knowledge. 
- Enables optimization of generated models through user feedback.
- Provides model export and visualization using standard notations.
- Ensures reliability through validation rules and controlled code execution.
- Designed to leverage improvements in LLMs for better process understanding and modeling.

In summary, ProMoAI pioneers the application of LLMs for intuitive and automated process modeling, significantly reducing the barriers to creating and refining accurate process models.
