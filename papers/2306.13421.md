# [Long-range Language Modeling with Self-retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- Proposes a new architecture called Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT) for long-range language modeling. RPT has a native retrieval ability built into the model architecture and training.

- RPT takes a chunk of text as input, retrieves semantically-relevant chunks from earlier in the document to provide context, and fuses the representations of retrieved chunks into the model to better predict the next chunk.

- The retriever component is trained jointly with the language model using a semantic objective. The goal is to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of generating the subsequent chunk, as evaluated by a reference language model. 

- Evaluated on long-range LM tasks like books, code, and math writing. RPT improves retrieval quality and perplexity compared to strong baselines like RETRO and TRIME.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating retrieval tightly into the model architecture and training process from scratch will improve long-range language modeling performance by enabling the model to leverage relevant context from anywhere in the document history. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed RPT model and experiments on various long-range LM datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 From my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) from scratch. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. Proposing the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), which is a RALM where the retriever component is trained jointly from scratch as an integral part of the language model. This differs from prior work that typically adds retrieval as a module on top of a pretrained LM.

2. Presenting a training approach where the retriever is trained with a semantic objective to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of generating the next chunk according to a reference LM. This provides a useful learning signal compared to just using lexical similarity.

3. Evaluating RPT on several long-range language modeling datasets and showing improved perplexity compared to strong baselines. The results demonstrate the benefit of deeply integrating retrieval into the LM architecture and training.

4. Analysis showing that RPT can retrieve higher quality chunks compared to retrievers relying only on lexical signals. This further validates the advantage of the proposed semantic training objective.

In summary, the key innovation is enabling stronger joint training of the retriever and LM through the model architecture and semantic training approach. By deeply integrating retrieval into the LM, RPT demonstrates improved language modeling capabilities. The authors argue this can pave the way for a new generation of pretrained LMs with native retrieval abilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main point of the paper:

The paper proposes the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), a new language model architecture that integrates retrieval as a core component by training a retriever jointly with the model from scratch to retrieve semantically relevant context from earlier in a long document to help predict upcoming text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper presents a novel architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented language model from scratch. Most prior work in retrieval-augmented LMs has focused on adding retrieval components to already pretrained LMs rather than training them jointly from scratch. The work is most similar to TRIME in this regard, but differs in using a more semantic training signal and representation-level fusion of retrieved context.

- For the task of modeling long texts, this paper demonstrates strong performance compared to prior work like the Memorizing Transformer and Block-Recurrent Transformer. The use of chunked cross-attention to fuse retrieved representations seems to be beneficial for long-range dependencies in texts. 

- Compared to methods like REALM and FiD that focus more on knowledge-intensive tasks, this work is tailored to long-form text generation by using a decoder-only architecture. The repeated chunk-level retrieval is better suited for long documents rather than one-time retrieval based on an initial prompt.

- The retriever training method is related to EPR and Atlas, which also use a reference LM to provide a semantic training signal. However, those methods start from a pretrained foundation, while this work trains the full model jointly from scratch.

- The analysis provides some useful insights into the tradeoffs between lexical and semantic signals for supervision. It appears lexical signals are surprisingly effective for certain domains like code, while semantic signals have more of an advantage for books/literature.

Overall, this paper pushes forward joint training of retrieval-augmented LMs with a novel architecture and training procedure tailored for long texts. The joint training from scratch and representation-level integration of the retriever seem to provide benefits over prior work. More analysis on scaling up the models and retriever training would be interesting future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Scaling up RPT. The authors suggest exploring larger and more capable RPT architectures and training them on ever-larger datasets to learn even richer semantic representations for retrieval. This could enable improved performance on long-range tasks.

- Investigating alternate training objectives and supervisory signals for the retriever component beyond the scoring LM approach. Other signals like contrastive learning could potentially improve retrieval quality. 

- Exploring alternate fusion mechanisms for integrating retrieved context beyond chunked cross-attention. Other fusion approaches may be able to more effectively incorporate retrieved information.

- Pre-training the full RPT architecture from scratch on large corpora before fine-tuning on downstream tasks. The authors envision RPT as a foundation for the next generation of pretrained LMs.

- Adapting techniques like re-attention to allow fine-tuning RPT on downstream tasks to adapt the retriever. This could enable beneficial co-adaptation of the retriever and decoder for specific applications.

- Extending RPT to encoder-decoder architectures and other modalities like images/video to develop multi-modal retrieval-augmented models.

- Analyzing different chunking strategies such as adaptive chunk sizes and sliding windows. The optimal approach likely depends on factors like domain and context length.

- Investigating whether recurrent components could complement the self-attention mechanism in RPT to better model long-range dependencies.

In summary, the core directions focus on scaling up RPT, exploring alternative training signals and integration mechanisms, pre-training and adaptation techniques, and extending the overall RPT paradigm to new domains and modalities. The authors position RPT as a promising path toward more capable and efficient language models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel architecture and training procedure for a retrieval-augmented language model called the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT). RPT trains a retriever jointly from scratch with the language model, allowing them to adapt to one another during training. The retriever takes representations from the language model to compute chunk embeddings and perform semantic retrieval of relevant context from earlier in the document. The retrieved chunks are then fused into the language model representations through chunked cross-attention layers. A key contribution is training the retriever with an auxiliary loss that encourages retrieving chunks that increase the probability of generating the subsequent text chunk, according to a reference language model. Experiments on modeling long documents like books, code, and math writing show RPT improves perplexity over strong baselines by retrieving better context. The work demonstrates the potential for integrating retrieval natively into language model pretraining.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), a retrieval-augmented language model where the retriever component is trained jointly from scratch as an integral part of the model architecture and training process. RPT takes as input a chunk of text and computes query representations using the LM representations. These queries are used to retrieve relevant chunks from earlier in the document, with the goal of increasing the probability of generating the subsequent chunk. 

RPT employs two key ideas: 1) An architecture where retrieved chunks are fused into the LM representations to augment text generation. 2) A training procedure where the retriever is trained using a semantic objective to retrieve chunks that improve perplexity according to a reference LM. Experiments across four long-range language modeling datasets demonstrate that RPT improves retrieval quality and perplexity compared to strong baselines by deeply integrating retrieval into the model. The authors argue RPT provides a path toward a new generation of pretrained LMs with native retrieval abilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), which is a retrieval-augmented language model designed for modeling long texts like books, articles, code, and scripts. RPT consists of a Transformer decoder stack split into two parts - a lower decoder that produces representations for a retriever component, and an upper decoder that fuses retrieved information back into the model through chunked cross-attention. The key ideas are: (1) The retriever uses representations from the lower decoder itself to perform retrieval, which the authors call "self-retrieval". (2) The retriever is trained with a semantic objective to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of generating the next chunk according to a reference scoring LM. Specifically, given a recently generated chunk, the retriever learns to retrieve earlier chunks in the document that improve the prediction of the subsequent chunk, where usefulness is evaluated by the scoring LM. This allows the retriever to retrieve based on semantic relevance rather than just lexical overlap. The model is trained end-to-end so that the retriever and decoder LM can adapt to each other. Experiments on modeling long texts like books, code, and papers show perplexity gains over strong baselines.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new architecture and training procedure called Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT) for long-range language modeling. 

- RPT aims to address the limitations of prior work on retrieval-augmented language models (LMs), where the retriever component is typically added after pretraining rather than trained jointly from scratch. This prevents the retriever from adapting to the LM.

- RPT has two main contributions:

1) It integrates a retriever natively into the LM architecture, where the LM computes query representations that are used by the retriever to retrieve relevant chunks from earlier in the document. The retrieved chunks are then fused into the LM's representations to help predict the next chunk. 

2) The retriever is trained using an auxiliary loss to encourage retrieving chunks that increase the probability of generating the subsequent text, according to a reference LM. This provides a semantic training signal.

- RPT is evaluated on long-range LM tasks like books, code, and math writing. It shows improved retrieval quality and perplexity compared to strong baselines.

So in summary, RPT addresses the limitations of prior work by proposing a new architecture and training approach to integrate retrieval more tightly into LMs for long-range language modeling. The key aim is improving retrieval quality and perplexity by training the retriever jointly from scratch as a native LM component.
