# [Long-range Language Modeling with Self-retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13421)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- Proposes a new architecture called Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT) for long-range language modeling. RPT has a native retrieval ability built into the model architecture and training.- RPT takes a chunk of text as input, retrieves semantically-relevant chunks from earlier in the document to provide context, and fuses the representations of retrieved chunks into the model to better predict the next chunk.- The retriever component is trained jointly with the language model using a semantic objective. The goal is to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of generating the subsequent chunk, as evaluated by a reference language model. - Evaluated on long-range LM tasks like books, code, and math writing. RPT improves retrieval quality and perplexity compared to strong baselines like RETRO and TRIME.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that integrating retrieval tightly into the model architecture and training process from scratch will improve long-range language modeling performance by enabling the model to leverage relevant context from anywhere in the document history. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed RPT model and experiments on various long-range LM datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

From my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) from scratch. Specifically, the key contributions are:1. Proposing the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), which is a RALM where the retriever component is trained jointly from scratch as an integral part of the language model. This differs from prior work that typically adds retrieval as a module on top of a pretrained LM.2. Presenting a training approach where the retriever is trained with a semantic objective to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of generating the next chunk according to a reference LM. This provides a useful learning signal compared to just using lexical similarity.3. Evaluating RPT on several long-range language modeling datasets and showing improved perplexity compared to strong baselines. The results demonstrate the benefit of deeply integrating retrieval into the LM architecture and training.4. Analysis showing that RPT can retrieve higher quality chunks compared to retrievers relying only on lexical signals. This further validates the advantage of the proposed semantic training objective.In summary, the key innovation is enabling stronger joint training of the retriever and LM through the model architecture and semantic training approach. By deeply integrating retrieval into the LM, RPT demonstrates improved language modeling capabilities. The authors argue this can pave the way for a new generation of pretrained LMs with native retrieval abilities.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the main point of the paper:The paper proposes the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), a new language model architecture that integrates retrieval as a core component by training a retriever jointly with the model from scratch to retrieve semantically relevant context from earlier in a long document to help predict upcoming text.
