# [An Evaluation Framework for Mapping News Headlines to Event Classes in a   Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02334)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a need for an automated way to map news headlines to event classes in a knowledge graph as part of event-based news monitoring and forecasting solutions. 
- Existing solutions rely on supervised classification methods requiring large manually labeled datasets, which is not feasible to cover a diverse range of event classes.
- There is currently no benchmark dataset or evaluation framework for evaluating unsupervised methods for this task.

Proposed Solution:
- Created a methodology and benchmark dataset of 110 Wikinews headlines manually mapped to event classes from Wikidata.
- Evaluated two classes of unsupervised methods using the benchmark:
  - Adaptations of classic entity linking systems like Falcon and Wikifier.
  - Pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models and large language models (LLMs) like GPT-J in a zero-shot setting.

Main Contributions:
- First benchmark dataset and evaluation framework for mapping news headlines to knowledge graph event classes.
- Analysis and comparison of different unsupervised methods, showing strengths and weaknesses of each.
- Entity linking and LLMs are complementary - ensemble approach combining both could improve performance.
- Analysis provides insights and future research directions, including extending dataset size, improving prompt engineering for LLMs, and developing ensemble methods.

In summary, the paper presented an important new task, benchmark dataset, initial analysis of methods, and insights to motivate and guide future work on knowledge-aware analysis of news events.
