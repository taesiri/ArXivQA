# [Using Left and Right Brains Together: Towards Vision and Language   Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10534)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large multi-modality models (LMMs) like GPT-3 can process textual and visual inputs but rely solely on linguistic reasoning for planning and decision making. They lack capabilities for visual imagination and reasoning.

- In contrast, human cognition utilizes both hemispheres of the brain - left for language, logic and sequential reasoning; right for spatial awareness and visual intuition. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Visual-Language Planning (VLP) framework to enable both visual and linguistic reasoning for multi-modality tasks.

- VLP has two key components working in parallel - Language Planning using LLM like ChatGPT to break down questions into logical steps, and Vision Planning using video prediction model to imagine potential future visual states.

- An LMM then synthesizes the language and vision plans to make the final decision, like the central decision making part of a human brain.

Key Contributions:
- Novel idea of incorporating visual planning along with language planning for multi-modality decision making, inspired by human brain's hemispheric functions.

- Implement VLP by integrating ChatGPT for language planning and Stable Diffusion for video prediction to realize the framework.

- Demonstrate VLP's superiority over standalone LMMs across vision-language tasks as well as pure vision and pure language tasks.

- Analysis shows both vision and language planning contribute positively. Vision planning is more useful for vision-centric tasks and language planning for linguistic tasks.

- Case studies illustrate how VLP results in more vivid, logical and contextually accurate responses compared to vanilla LMMs.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in enhancing multi-modality reasoning for AI systems by proposing and demonstrating a human brain inspired visual-language planning approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Visual-Language Planning (VLP) framework that conducts both language planning and vision planning to emulate the left and right hemispheres of the human brain, before making final decisions using a Large Multi-modality Model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1) Proposing Visual-Language Planning (VLP), a general multi-modal reasoning architecture, which involves both language planning (serves as left brain) and vision planning (serves as right brain).

2) Implementing Visual-Language Processing (VLP) by integrating advanced language generative models like ChatGPT with vision generative models like Stable Video Diffusion, enabling them to collaborate in solving complex problems. 

3) Showing that VLP not only significantly enhances performance in vision-language tasks but also demonstrates great potential in pure vision and language tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel VLP framework that conducts concurrent visual and language planning to enhance contextual awareness and task execution across different modalities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Visual-Language Planning (VLP) framework proposed in this paper:

1. The paper describes the Vision Planning branch as akin to the right hemisphere of the human brain, responsible for visual intuition and spatial awareness. But human visual processing involves many complex neural circuits and pathways. Does the paper's analogy of VP to the right hemisphere oversimplify the complexity of human visual cognition? How could the VP functionality be expanded to better capture elements of human visual processing?

2. The paper shows VLP improves performance on vision, language, and vision-language tasks. Does VLP also enable emergent capabilities beyond the original task formulations, similar to how the left and right hemispheres interact in the brain? For example, could it facilitate analogical reasoning by mapping between visual and textual concepts?  

3. The Vision Planning Selector separates out a Coarse Selector and Fine Selector. What motivates this separation of selecting whether to use vision planning versus selecting the best frames? Would an end-to-end learned selector work as effectively? How does the modular separation compare to visual attention mechanisms in human cognition?

4. For the Fine Selector, visual features are extracted using a CLIP encoder before selecting frames. How does the choice of visual encoder impact subsequent frame selection? Would an encoder pretrained on video tasks work better than the image-based CLIP encoder? Would a dynamical encoder that models frame sequences be more appropriate?

5. The Decision Maker uses a multi-round conversation strategy to query the LLM differently on vision and language plans. What are the limitations of this strategy when using state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4? Would a hybrid model that tightly integrates visual and language pathways be more effective as the Decision Maker?

6. The results show that ground truth future frames significantly improve performance over predicted future frames. What are the main failure modes of the video prediction models? How can video prediction be improved to better support Vision Planning? Are there other modalities beyond video frames that could inform Vision Planning?

7. Language planning is shown to be crucial when Vision Planning fails to select useful predicted future frames. This suggests potential benefits from fusing language and vision pathways earlier. Could Vision Planning be designed to take into account the textual query as well, similar to how human visual cognition is shaped by top-down linguistic context?  

8. Table 2 and Table 7 show that performance gains are much higher on descriptive reasoning compared to causal or temporal reasoning questions. Why does VLP have less impact on causal/temporal queries? Does directly providing future visual evidence hamper learning causal relationships? How could VLP functionality be designed to better support causal reasoning?

9. The paper demonstrates VLP for static image inputs and fixed video clips. How will performance be impacted for streaming video inputs, where the future is constantly unfolding? Will the system be able to dynamically interpolate and adjust vision plans over long horizons? Are reinforcement learning approaches better suited for such streaming operation?

10. Beyond improved performance on existing benchmarks, what novel vision-language tasks and capabilities could emerge from systems designed with dual visual and linguistic planning pathways as introduced in VLP? Could this approach ultimately enable richer scene understanding, via bidirectional grounding of visual and textual concepts?
