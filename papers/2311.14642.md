# [Continuous football player tracking from discrete broadcast data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14642)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for estimating continuous, full-pitch player tracking data in football matches using only highly discrete, incomplete player positions from broadcast footage. The method involves first building an autoregressive model to forecast player positions over time based on their past locations and the ball position. These forecasts are used to assign the sparse observed player positions in each frame to trajectories for individual players. With the trajectories assembled, the method then interpolates between points to create continuous paths. The algorithm is tested on open tracking data from one match, simulating broadcast data by subsampling player positions to those within 30 meters of the ball. It achieves strong performance, with a median error of 5.37 meters for non-visible player positions. The method compares well to previous event data-based approaches and could enrich datasets available to many clubs and researchers. The outputs retain some limitations in terms of error levels for detailed positioning analysis, but overall the technique provides a major improvement in creating approximate continuous tracking data from broadcast footage. Code is provided to apply the method to a dataset of over 200 matches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method to estimate continuous full-pitch player tracking data from discrete broadcast data by building a predictive model for player positions over time and interpolating between observed positions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of a novel method for estimating continuous, full-match tracking data of player positions from highly discrete, incomplete player positions recorded in broadcast footage. Specifically, the method only requires the team and player type (goalkeeper/outfield) to be recorded in each frame, without needing to identify individual players. This allows for approximate tracking data to be generated from broadcast footage at a similar level of effort to event data collection. The method is tested on open tracking data and made available for use on a dataset of over 200 matches.

In summary, the paper presents a practical approach to generate enriched tracking-style data from basic broadcast footage, helping to bridge the gap for clubs/researchers that lack access to high-end computer vision tracking but can collect some simple positional information from videos.

The paper focuses on developing a method to estimate continuous full-pitch tracking data for football players from discrete data collected from broadcast footage. It uses techniques like trajectory assignment, autoregressive modeling, and interpolation to generate estimated player positions over time. Key aspects analyzed include the error rates and performance of the position estimation, especially for players not visible in the footage ("off-camera"). Overall, the key terms reflect the paper's emphasis on generating and evaluating estimated player tracking data from limited broadcast inputs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that more data could allow for position-specific models to be built. What kinds of differences would you expect to see between models trained on data from different positions? How could the overall methodology be adapted to incorporate position-specific models?

2. The trajectory assignment step uses the Hungarian algorithm to match player identities between frames. What are some of the limitations of this approach? Could you propose an alternative assignment methodology that is more robust? 

3. The continuous path interpolation uses a velocity correction term. Explain the intuition behind this term and why it leads to more realistic paths compared to simple linear interpolation. How sensitive is the method to the choice of Î±?

4. The paper tests the method on a small dataset from Metrica Sports. What additional challenges do you anticipate in applying the method to the larger Statsbomb 360 dataset? How could the methodology be adapted to improve performance on this dataset?

5. Error analysis shows that dead ball situations are a major source of error. Propose a modification to the methodology to better handle these situations and reduce the associated errors.  

6. Figure 3 shows that error grows slowly with time since last observation. However, extremely long times since observation still produce unusable predictions. Suggest a method to determine when predictions should be discarded due to excessive uncertainty.

7. The method assumes player identities are not tracked between frames. How feasible do you think it would be to track identities? What modifications would need to be made to the method? What benefits would this provide?

8. The paper suggests video quality is too low for computer vision techniques at lower level matches. Do you think this limitation can be overcome in the next 5-10 years? How would this affect the relevance of the proposed method?

9. The method interpolation scheme in Equation 4 contains both a linear interpolation term and a velocity correction term. Justify why both terms are necessary to produce realistic paths. Can you think of any alternatives that would work as well or better?

10. The model is trained on only 2 matches from the Metrica dataset. If you had access to a larger training set, how could you modify the model structure or training process to take advantage of the additional data? What performance improvements would you expect?
