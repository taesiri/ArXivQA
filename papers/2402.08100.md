# [Investigating the Impact of Data Contamination of Large Language Models   in Text-to-SQL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08100)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown impressive capability for text-to-code generation tasks like translating text to SQL queries. However, their evaluation may be inflated due to "data contamination", where the test sets overlap with their pretraining data. 

- It is challenging to estimate data contamination for commercial LLMs with limited info about their training data. Also unclear if memorization drives the high performance in text-to-SQL tasks.

Proposed Solution
- Introduce a new text-to-SQL dataset "Termite" designed to not overlap with LLM pretraining data to test for contamination.

- Propose metric "DC-accuracy" to estimate data contamination by masking SQL schema in test sets and measuring LLM accuracy in predicting masked column names.

- Test robustness to adversarial modifications like removing foreign keys, which makes SQL generation harder without memorization.

Key Results
- GPT-3.5 shows 33% DC-accuracy on Spider dataset vs only 13% on Termite, indicating contamination.

- In text-to-SQL task, GPT-3.5 accuracy is 16-20% higher on Spider compared to Termite across query difficulties.

- Adversarial modifications degrade performance much more on Termite than Spider, confirming memorization's role.

Main Contributions  
- Method to estimate contamination for text-to-SQL in commercial LLMs 

- Termite dataset preserved from pretraining to enable uncontaminated evaluation

- Evidence that contamination causes overestimation of LLM capabilities on text-to-SQL tasks


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the impact of data contamination on GPT-3.5's performance in text-to-SQL translation, finding that contamination leads to overestimation of capabilities by comparing performance on known and novel datasets and analyzing robustness to adversarial input perturbations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The proposal of Termite, a new Text-to-SQL dataset designed to be unseen by large language models to enable uncontaminated evaluation. 

2) A method to estimate the presence of data contamination in LLMs on the Text-to-SQL task by measuring their ability to reconstruct masked database dumps from seen vs unseen datasets.

3) An analysis showing significant differences in GPT-3.5's text-to-SQL performance on the widely used Spider dataset compared to the new Termite dataset, indicating overestimation of capabilities due to data contamination. 

4) The demonstration that adversarial modifications which make the task harder have a greater negative impact on GPT-3.5's performance on the unseen Termite dataset compared to Spider, further confirming the role of memorization and data contamination in Spider results.

In summary, the key contribution is highlighting and providing evidence for the issue of data contamination leading to inflated metrics of LLM performance on text-to-SQL tasks, through the careful construction of an unseen dataset and analysis methodology. The paper calls for reexamination of benchmarks and capabilities claims relying solely on potentially contaminated test sets.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Data contamination - Refers to the issue where a model may have been exposed to or trained on data that overlaps with its test set, leading to inflated performance metrics. A main concept explored in this paper.

- Text-to-SQL - The task of translating natural language queries into SQL code. The authors investigate GPT-3.5's capabilities on this task.  

- Termite - The novel text-to-SQL dataset constructed by the authors to serve as unseen data for evaluating potential data contamination in models like GPT-3.5.

- Spider - A common benchmark text-to-SQL dataset that may have been used in GPT-3.5's pretraining. Used as the "seen" dataset.

- Adversarial table disconnection (ATD) - A method introduced in the paper to make the text-to-SQL task more difficult by removing structural information from the databases. 

- Zero-shot evaluation - The authors test GPT-3.5's text-to-SQL capabilities without any task-specific fine-tuning, in a zero-shot setting.

- Memorization - Also referred to as data contamination. The paper examines whether GPT-3.5's text-to-SQL performance is more due to memorization of training data rather than true understanding.

These are some of the key terms and concepts central to this paper and its experiments on assessing potential data contamination in text-to-SQL translation capabilities of models like GPT-3.5.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called Termite for evaluating text-to-SQL capabilities of models. What are some key considerations and steps taken in the construction of Termite to make it suitable for assessing potential data contamination issues?

2. The paper proposes a metric called DC-accuracy to quantify potential data contamination by measuring a model's ability to predict masked column names in database dumps. What are some limitations of using DC-accuracy and how could it be improved or supplemented with additional analysis? 

3. When evaluating GPT-3.5 on text-to-SQL using Termite and Spider, there is a notable performance gap. However, how can we further validate that this gap is primarily attributable to data contamination rather than other dataset biases?

4. The paper applies an adversarial table disconnection (ATD) technique to make text-to-SQL translation more challenging by removing structural information from the databases. Why is observing model robustness to ATD an effective indicator of memorization based on data contamination?

5. Could the differences in text-to-SQL performance on Termite vs Spider be alternatively explained by issues in prompt design rather than data contamination? How does the paper address or control for this?

6. What are some methodological limitations related to drawing conclusions about data contamination from evaluations focused only on GPT-3.5? How could analysis be extended to further models?  

7. How suitable is the Test Suite Accuracy metric used in the paper for making judgments related to data contamination? Could any of its properties positively or negatively bias results?

8. Do the findings indicate GPT-3.5 has no true text-to-SQL capabilities outside of memorization, or just that accuracy has been overestimated on benchmarks like Spider? What additional experiments could help further determine its actual capabilities?

9. For determining model robustness to ATD, are there any alternative techniques besides fully removing foreign key constraints that may reveal additional insights into the role of memorization?

10. What are some key takeaways from the paper's analysis that should influence research moving forward related to assessment of model performance, especially for code generation tasks?
