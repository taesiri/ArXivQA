# [ORCa: Glossy Objects as Radiance Field Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04531)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we convert everyday glossy objects with unknown geometry into "radiance-field cameras" that can estimate the 5D radiance field of their surroundings?

The key ideas and contributions are:

- Modeling reflections on glossy objects as projections of the 5D radiance field of the environment onto the object surface. 

- Converting the object surface into a "virtual sensor" by treating the intersection of camera rays with the object as virtual pixels that each view a part of the environment radiance field.

- Analytically computing the parameters (origin, direction, radius) of "virtual cones" through each virtual pixel to sample the environment radiance field.

- Jointly estimating the object geometry, diffuse radiance, and 5D environment radiance field from multi-view images. 

- Showing that the estimated 5D radiance field enables depth estimation, occlusion-aware rendering, and novel-view synthesis beyond the observer camera's field of view.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling reflections as projections of a 5D radiance field and converting the object into a virtual sensor enables perceiving and rendering the environment from the object's perspective. The paper aims to demonstrate this through joint learning of geometry, diffuse radiance, and the environment radiance field.
