# [Disentangling continuous and discrete linguistic signals in   transformer-based sentence embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11272)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentence embeddings encode both continuous (e.g. lexical semantics) and discrete (e.g. syntax) linguistic information. However, it is not clear how different types of information are encoded in the distributed representations.
- The goal is to disentangle different linguistic signals from transformer-based sentence embeddings and link them to more symbolic representations. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use diagnostic datasets focused on specific linguistic phenomena (subject-verb agreement in French, verb alternations in English) as a testbed.
- Compress sentence embeddings into a latent representation with separate continuous and discrete components using a variational autoencoder architecture. 
- Test whether targeted phenomena become more explicit when separated into continuous vs discrete latent variables.

Experiments:
- Test on artificial datasets with increasing lexical variation to evaluate impact on detecting linguistic patterns.
- Evaluate performance on multiple choice problems testing ability to capture targeted phenomena. 
- Do error analysis to understand what information is captured by discrete vs continuous latent variables.

Results:
- Discrete + continuous latent representation leads to higher performance compared to only continuous or discrete.
- Error analysis shows discrete part captures more structural violations, continuous part more impacted by lexical variations.
- Indicates syntactic and semantic information can be separated and made more explicit. 

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates syntactic and semantic signals can be disentangled from distributed sentence representations.
- Shows promise for linking such signals to more symbolic representations. 
- Provides insights into how different types of linguistic information are encoded by transformer models.
- Introduces diagnostic technique for probing representations using controlled datasets and latent variable models.

The key insight is that explicitly separating continuous and discrete variables in the latent space better captures targeted linguistic phenomena compared to standard sentence embeddings. This shows promise for improving interpretability.
