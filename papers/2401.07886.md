# [Learned Best-Effort LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07886)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learned Best-Effort LLM Serving":

Problem:
- Applications using large language models (LLMs) for user-facing features need to provide low latency responses to maintain good user experience. 
- Over-provisioning resources to handle fluctuating request loads is expensive. Using smaller models degrades quality.
- Existing model serving systems use static model allocation and do not adapt based on system load.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a "best-effort serving system" that dynamically routes requests between multiple LLM sizes to balance latency and quality.
- Uses a learned router based on deep reinforcement learning to pick the model for each request based on system state.
- State encodes task type, model batch sizes, and request rate. Action is model to route request to. 
- Reward function balances quality and meeting latency deadlines. Supports both hard and soft deadlines.
- Allows flexibility for developers to customize quality-latency tradeoffs.

Main Contributions:
- Learned router outperforms static routing baselines on both stable and unpredictable workloads.
- Maintains 10x higher availability than static routing. 
- Achieves 96%+ of peak performance 4.1x more often than static routing.
- Shows robustness to shifts in task distribution and arrival patterns.
- Achieves much higher performance per hardware unit than static routing.
- Applicable to a variety of system environments and requirements.
- Provides a new serving paradigm for low-latency LLM applications.

In summary, the paper presents a best-effort serving system with a learned router that can dynamically trade off quality and latency to maximize overall performance based on system state. Key benefits are higher availability, quality of service, and hardware efficiency compared to static serving baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a learned best-effort large language model serving system that dynamically routes requests to different sized models based on system load and task information in order to maximize overall performance across fluctuating workloads.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm of best-effort serving for low-latency large language model (LLM) applications. The key ideas are:

1) Using a learned router to dynamically route incoming requests to different LLM models of varying quality and latency, in order to provide the best possible quality of service given changing system load and task distribution. 

2) Formulating LLM serving as a reinforcement learning problem where the router maximizes a flexible performance metric that captures both quality and latency based on application needs.

3) Showing that this approach of learned best-effort serving provides higher availability, increased performance, cheaper serving, and more flexibility compared to traditional static serving methods.

4) Demonstrating the applicability of the approach to a variety of settings including hard deadlines, soft deadlines, different deadlines per task, etc.

In summary, the paper presents the concept of learned best-effort serving as an efficient paradigm for low-latency LLM applications and shows its advantages over status-quo static serving baselines.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a best-effort serving system that uses deep reinforcement learning to route requests between multiple LLMs of varying sizes. How does the state representation used to train the routing policy capture information about the system load, tasks, and models? What other information could potentially be incorporated?

2. The reward function balances quality and latency. How is the tradeoff parameterized? Could different reward functions lead to policies that optimize for other objectives like fairness or priority? 

3. The paper evaluates performance under both hard and soft deadlines. What are the tradeoffs in using hard versus soft deadlines? In what types of applications might one be preferred over the other?

4. Unpredictable workloads with bursts in arrival rate are common in practice. How does the learned policy compare to baselines in unpredictable workloads? What specifically allows it to handle variability better?

5. The paper argues the policy is robust to distribution shift in tasks. What evidence supports this claim? What types of distribution shift is it robust to and why? Are there limitations?

6. Serving smaller models alongside a large model is argued to not inhibit the large model's serving ability. What is the justification for this? How are resources divided between models on the GPUs?

7. The policy learning algorithm, network architecture, and hyperparameters are largely fixed in the paper. How sensitive is the overall approach to these choices? What tuning was performed and what still needs to be explored? 

8. The paper evaluates on a simple setup with set of fixed OPT model sizes. How can the approach extend to more complex environments with heterogeneous hardware and dynamic model loading?

9. Autoscaling methods are discussed as alternatives. How do the learned policies compare and contrast with autoscalers? What are the tradeoffs between the two approaches?

10. The discussion argues flexibility in customizing for specific applications. What components are most amenable to customization on a per-application basis? What challenges exist in specializing the system?
