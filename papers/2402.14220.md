# [Estimating Unknown Population Sizes Using the Hypergeometric   Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14220)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The hypergeometric distribution models discrete count data when sampling occurs without replacement from a finite population. It captures the dependence between category counts unlike the multinomial distribution.
- Estimating the parameters of this distribution is important for modeling many real-world scenarios involving finite populations and sparse/under-sampled data. 
- However, there is a gap in existing methods to estimate the distribution when both the total population size and the size of constituent categories are unknown, which is a common problem setting.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel method to estimate the unknown hypergeometric population sizes using maximum likelihood. 
- They use a continuous relaxation of the likelihood to enable optimization. The estimates are thresholded to satisfy constraints.
- The method is extended to a VAE framework to model mixtures of hypergeometric distributions conditioned on a latent variable. This handles under-sampled, high-dimensional sparse count data.

Key Contributions:
- First empirical demonstration that jointly estimating total population size and category sizes is tractable, even with severe under-sampling.
- Proposed method outperforms multinomial and Poisson likelihoods in accuracy of estimates and learning useful latent representations.
- Demonstrated applications in NLP (estimating passage complexity) and biology (recovering true gene expression counts in single-cell data).
- Addresses gap in literature regarding hypergeometric parameter estimation. Enables improved modeling of finite, dependent count data.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel hypergeometric likelihood-based method to estimate unknown population sizes from under-sampled count data. Experiments show it accurately recovers parameters and outperforms other likelihoods. The method promises modeling improvements in many real-world scenarios involving dependent discrete data and unknown population sizes.
