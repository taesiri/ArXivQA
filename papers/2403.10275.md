# [A Question on the Explainability of Large Language Models and the   Word-Level Univariate First-Order Plausibility Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10275)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent large language models (LLMs) like BERT exhibit a tradeoff between excellent performance and lack of explainability. 
- Explainability of LLMs is usually studied for a single trained model, but the training uses randomness that impacts explainability.
- Prior work showed explanations can significantly differ between equivalent models (similar accuracy) on compatible inputs. 
- There is a need to characterize the sensitivity of LLM explanations to training randomness.

Proposed Solution:
- Focus on a case where word-level, univariate, first-order explanations are analyzed.
- Define signal of explanations as variance of words' attention means over models. 
- Define noise as mean of words' attention variances over models.  
- Compute signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to quantify informativeness of explanations.

Contributions:
- Show for a French text classification task that explanations from CamemBERT have lower signal and higher noise compared to a simpler feature-based model.
- Highlight that combining LLM accuracy and explainability may require moving beyond word-level univariate first-order explanations.
- Discuss possibility of using more complex explanations based on word tuples, multivariate attention, and higher-order analysis.
- Raise open question on whether accuracy and explainability represent an unavoidable tradeoff.

In summary, the paper formally analyzes the sensitivity of LLM explanations to training randomness, shows limitations of simple explanation methods, and raises the question if more complex explanation methods could improve LLM explainability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper questions whether large language models can provide explanations as simple yet informative as those from basic models, or if improving their explainability requires moving beyond simplistic assumptions about what explanations humans can plausibly understand.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

It proposes a quantitative characterization of the sensitivity of large language models' (LLMs) explanations to the randomness used during training. Specifically, it introduces definitions of "signal", "noise", and "signal-to-noise ratio" (SNR) for explanations, under the assumption that only simple, word-level, univariate, first-order explanations are plausible for human readers (the "(1,1,1) plausibility assumption"). 

It then shows experimentally, using a text classification case study with the CamemBERT LLM and a simpler feature-based model, that under this assumption the explanations from CamemBERT have lower signal and SNR than the feature-based model. 

The paper concludes that either the (1,1,1) plausibility assumption needs to be challenged and more complex explanations considered, or there is an unavoidable tradeoff between accuracy and explainability when comparing simple models to large language models. So it raises the question of whether both high accuracy and high explainability can be achieved with a single model.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Explainability of large language models (LLMs)
- Sensitivity of explanations to training randomness
- Word-level univariate first-order plausibility assumption
- Definitions of signal, noise, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for explanations
- Comparison of explanations from CamemBERT (transformer) vs simpler feature-based model
- Conclusion that simpler models have higher signal and lower noise under the plausibility assumption
- Discussion of potential for more complex explanations (word tuples, multivariate, higher-order statistics) to improve LLM explainability

In summary, the key terms cover the concepts of explainability, sensitivity to randomness, statistical definitions of signal and noise, comparisons between different models, and the tradeoffs around simple vs complex explanations for large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes defining the signal and noise of explanations in order to quantify their sensitivity to model randomness. What are the specific mathematical definitions given for signal and noise? How exactly do they capture the informativeness and variability of explanations?

2. The paper makes a "word-level univariate first-order plausibility assumption" to justify using only the mean attention values of explanations. What does this assumption state? Why is it needed to define signal and noise? What are its limitations?

3. The authors compute the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of explanations under this assumption. What does a low SNR imply about the informativeness of explanations? Could you conceive of cases where a low SNR may not imply low informativeness?

4. The authors state that their statistical notion of signal may diverge from a more semantic one. Can you elaborate on what a semantic definition of signal may look like? How might it differ and why might it be important?

5. The paper concludes that simpler models may provide more informative explanations than large language models under the proposed framework. What evidence supports this conclusion? Are there ways the conclusion could be challenged or expanded?  

6. The authors propose investigating whether more complex explanations with tuples of words and higher order statistics could improve explanations from large language models. What challenges do you foresee in getting human understanding of such explanations?

7. The experimental methodology involves generating multiple equivalent models and compatible inputs. What considerations went into the selection of these models and inputs? How else could appropriate model and input pairs be selected?

8. The paper relies entirely on post-hoc explanations produced through layer-wise relevance propagation. What issues could arise from relying solely on a post-hoc method? How important is it to design inherent explainability into models?

9. The authors use attention-based explanations that highlight important words/phrases. What other forms of explanations exist for text classification? What metrics could capture their sensitivity apart from signal and noise?

10. The paper studies sensitivity to randomness for a single text classification task. How might the conclusions change if applied to other NLP tasks like machine translation, question answering etc? What task-specific factors need consideration?
