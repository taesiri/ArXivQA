# [DeepSeek-VL: Towards Real-World Vision-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05525)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
There is a significant performance gap between most open-source large multimodal models (LMMs) and proprietary models in terms of real-world performance and user experience. The key issues are: (1) Over-reliance on instruction tuning rather than extensive pretraining; (2) Instruction tuning datasets are not representative of real usage scenarios; (3) Vision encoders operate on low resolution inputs which limits detailed understanding; (4) There is often degradation of language skills after prolonged multimodal training.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents DeepSeek-VL, an open-source LMM aimed at adept real-world performance. The key aspects are:

(1) Diverse and large-scale pretraining data encompassing web screenshots, PDFs, OCR, charts, textbooks etc. to represent real-world scenarios.

(2) Instruction tuning dataset based on a manually-curated taxonomy of real user test cases for better alignment with practical applications.  

(3) Hybrid vision encoder combining semantic features from a text-aligned encoder and detailed features from a high-resolution encoder for efficient 1024x1024 image encoding.

(4) Joint language-multimodal training strategy to preserve language skills. Gradual adjustment of modality ratios and a "warm-up" approach manages competitive dynamics between vision and language.

Main Contributions:

- A systematic methodology for multimodal model development targeting real-world performance through data curation, model architecture and training strategy. 

- The DeepSeek-VL model family, available in 1.3B and 7B parameter sizes, which demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance on vision-language tasks while maintaining language performance.

- Superior real-world experience as a chatbot across diverse tasks like diagrams, web pages, math, literature etc. as evidenced by human evaluation.

- Public release of models to promote further research and innovation in multimodal AI.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents DeepSeek-VL, an open-source large multimodal model designed for real-world vision and language understanding applications, which achieves strong performance by focusing on diverse and scalable data construction, an efficient hybrid vision encoder architecture, and a training strategy that balances integration of vision while preserving language model capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents DeepSeek-VL, an open-source large multimodal model designed for real-world vision and language understanding applications. Its main contributions include:

1) Comprehensive vision-language data construction from diverse real-world sources to ensure the model's ability to handle practical contexts like web screenshots, PDFs, OCR, charts, and knowledge content. It also creates an instruction tuning dataset based on a taxonomy of real user scenarios to improve user experience.

2) A hybrid vision encoder architecture that efficiently encodes high-resolution 1024x1024 images within a fixed token budget to capture both semantic and detailed visual information. This enables handling of tasks requiring high resolution like dense OCR and visual grounding.

3) An effective vision-language pretraining strategy that integrates LLM training from the beginning and carefully manages the competitive dynamics between vision and language modalities. It gradually adjusts the modality ratio over time to facilitate balanced integration and prevent degradation of language capabilities.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an open-source multimodal model specially designed through comprehensive data construction, model architecture innovations, and training strategy optimizations to achieve superior real-world vision and language understanding performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a "hybrid vision encoder" that combines a high-resolution encoder (SAM-B) and a low-resolution encoder (SigLIP-L). What motivated this design choice compared to using a single high-resolution encoder? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper introduces a 3-stage training methodology. Can you explain the motivation and objective behind each stage? What role does each stage play in the overall training process?  

3. The paper finds that simply mixing language and multimodal data leads to degradation in language capabilities. How exactly does the "joint language-multimodal training" strategy address this? What is the impact of varying the mixing ratio?

4. The "modality warmup" strategy is proposed to stabilize training. Can you explain how this strategy works? What problems does it aim to solve and why is it effective?

5. What motivated the design choice of incorporating a vision-only self-supervised encoder like SAM-B? How does using vision-only encoders compared to text-image encoders impact overall performance?

6. The paper explores different strategies for combining visual features along sequence and embedding dimensions. What are the tradeoffs involved? Which method works best and why?

7. What are some ways the Vision-Language adaptor design is optimized in the paper? How do factors like using separate vs shared MLPs impact performance?  

8. The paper finds that directly mixing modalities decreases training efficiency. How does the proposed "modality group training" method address this? What efficiency gains does it provide?

9. How is the model evaluation strategy adapted for the smaller 1.3B model during pretraining experiments? What techniques are used to obtain more reliable results?

10. What are some limitations of the proposed method? What directions for future work are identified to further advance multimodal modeling?
