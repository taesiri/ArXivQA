# [Finding Waldo: Towards Efficient Exploration of NeRF Scene Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04508)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have become popular for compactly representing 3D scenes and novel view synthesis. However, a key use case that has been largely ignored is exploring the scene space encoded by a NeRF model to find desired views that meet certain criteria (e.g. improving image composition, maximizing object saliency). 

- This problem of "scene exploration" has not been formally defined or addressed before. There are no existing methods suitable as baselines.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formally defines the scene exploration framework: Given a NeRF model of a scene, find the camera pose and viewing angle that renders a novel view adhering to some user-defined criteria related to appearance and/or geometry.

- Since no baselines exist, the paper proposes two naive methods:
   1) Guided Random Search (GRS): Randomly samples poses guided by training pose distribution
   2) Pose Interpolation-Based Search (PIBS): Interpolates between high-scoring pose pairs
   
- The paper then views scene exploration as a constrained optimization problem and proposes Evolution-Guided Pose Search (EGPS) based on a genetic algorithm. EGPS performs crossover and mutation on high-scoring poses to efficiently explore promising areas of pose space.

Key Contributions:
- First paper to formally define scene exploration for NeRF models to search for novel views meeting user criteria
- Proposed two baseline methods (GRS and PIBS) for scene exploration
- Developed a criteria-agnostic and efficient evolution-based method (EGPS) for scene exploration
- Performed extensive experiments on improving image aesthetics, quality and saliency, showing EGPS outperforms baselines

The paper highlighted limitations around NeRF artifacts and criteria sensitivity, and outlined directions for future work in robust criteria functions, multi-criteria exploration, and pose trajectory exploration.
