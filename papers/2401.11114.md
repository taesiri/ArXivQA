# [DengueNet: Dengue Prediction using Spatiotemporal Satellite Imagery for   Resource-Limited Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11114)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Dengue fever is a major public health challenge in developing countries due to poor sanitation infrastructure and limited healthcare systems. Timely detection of dengue outbreaks is critical for prevention but requires data collection approaches that many lower-middle income countries (LMICs) lack resources for.  

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes using publicly available high-resolution satellite imagery as an accessible data source for early dengue outbreak prediction. They introduce DengueNet, an architecture that combines Vision Transformer (ViT), Radiomics and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to extract spatiotemporal features from satellite images and forecast weekly dengue cases at the municipality level.

- A scalable framework leveraging Sentinel Hub extracts and processes multi-spectral Sentinel-2 imagery into time-series data. Custom preprocessing handles noise removal and feature extraction. 

- DengueNet feeds these satellite image features into LSTM layers to capture temporal dynamics. The LSTM outputs are connected to a neural network that predicts dengue incidence.

Main Contributions:

- Scalable satellite image extraction framework for reproducible access to freely available data

- Innovative DengueNet model architecture for spatiotemporal modeling of satellite imagery to predict dengue outbreaks

- Demonstration of feasibility and predictive capability of forecasting dengue solely from satellite images, with DengueNet achieving mean average error between 5-114 cases across five Colombian cities

- Potential for satellite-image based modeling to promote more equitable early dengue warning systems in resource-constrained countries and improve prevention strategies

In summary, the paper presents a novel satellite imagery modeling approach to predict dengue outbreaks, requiring only freely available data, with results showing this can produce actionable insights for dengue control in lower-resourced municipalities. The frameworks developed help democratize access and reduce barriers to advanced modeling for poorer regions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning model called DengueNet that leverages publicly available satellite imagery to predict dengue outbreaks, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained countries to improve prevention and control strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors introduce a scalable data collection and processing framework to extract time-series data from the Sentinel-2 satellite. 

2) They propose a novel preprocessing pipeline that can effectively eliminate noises and extract spatiotemporal features from the collected satellite imagery.

3) Their model, DengueNet, shows positive results, indicating dengue forecasting with time-series satellite imagery alone is a feasible approach for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited resources.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of using freely available satellite imagery and a novel DengueNet architecture to predict dengue cases in resource-constrained settings like LMICs. The scalable data framework and effectiveness of the predictive model on real-world data are the key contributions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using Sentinel Hub for satellite data extraction. Can you expand more on the specific steps and settings used in Sentinel Hub to collect the multi-spectral satellite imagery time series? What challenges did you face with using this platform?

2. You utilized cloud and cloud shadow removal techniques in your preprocessing pipeline. Can you elaborate on why this is an important step for satellite imagery? What thresholding percentile values did you find worked best for detecting clouds and shadows? 

3. For the Vision Transformer (ViT) module, you mention using transfer learning from a model pre-trained on ImageNet. What modifications, if any, did you make to the pre-trained ViT model before fitting it to the satellite data? How did you determine the appropriate input size to the model?

4. The Feature Engineering module extracts first order and higher order statistical features. What specific features did you extract and why did you choose those? How did you determine which features were most relevant for the task? 

5. You concatenated the outputs of the ViT and Feature Engineering modules before feeding into the LSTM networks. What was the motivation behind using two separate spatial feature extraction modules? What unique perspectives does each module contribute?

6. You trained and evaluated a separate model for each municipality rather than a unified model. What factors motivated this decision? Do you think a unified model could have worked as well? What changes would be needed?

7. For the LSTM module, how did you determine the optimal number of LSTM layers to use? Did you experiment with any other sequence modeling architectures like GRUs? If so, how did their performance compare?

8. In the ablation studies, the inclusion of both feature extraction modules improved performance over either one alone. However, the cloud/shadow removal did not have a large impact. Why do you think that is the case? 

9. You evaluated your model on 5 different municipalities. What similarities or differences did you notice in the model performance across locations? What factors do you think contributed to that?

10. You mentioned the potential for using satellite imagery to promote health fairness and equity. Can you expand on specific ways this type of machine learning model could help improve accessibility and quality of care? What are some limitations or risks that should also be considered?
