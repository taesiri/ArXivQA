# [LiFi: Lightweight Controlled Text Generation with Fine-Grained Control   Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06930)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing methods for controlled text generation rely on discrete, categorical, and exclusive control codes, which ignore variance in attribute strengths and overlapping attributes. This limits their ability to capture nuances in language and interconnections between attributes. 

- Methods that fine-tune the entire language model are costly. Methods that only update part of the model lack control strength.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes Lifi, a lightweight controlled text generation method using fine-grained control codes. 

- Lifi first trains an attribute classifier to automatically generate continuous, relative, non-exclusive control codes reflecting attribute strengths.

- Small adapters are inserted into each layer of a pre-trained language model (keeping the original model fixed). Adapters specialize towards different attributes. 

- During training, only the adapters are updated. Control codes guide adapter fusion to steer text generation.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces fine-grained, continuous control codes that capture variance in attribute strengths and interconnections between attributes

- Achieves controlled text generation via efficient adapters with minimal overhead (~0.04% parameters)

- Outperforms strong baselines on sentiment control, topic control and a new task of stylistic novel writing

- More robust as handles overlapping attributes and is less prone to over-specialization compared to baselines

- Framework allows easy incorporation of abundant unlabeled data to improve generation

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient and effective approach for controlled text generation using fine-grained control signals derived automatically from data.
