# [Reinforcement Learning from Delayed Observations via World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically assume that agents receive immediate feedback about the effects of their actions. However, in many real-world applications, observations can be delayed due to physical or technological constraints. These delays challenge the fundamental assumption in RL and can significantly impact the performance of algorithms. Prior work has studied delays in fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), but delays in partially observable MDPs (POMDPs) have received little attention. POMDPs with delays, where observations provide partial information about latent state transitions, are an important practical setting for applying RL.

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes using world models, which have shown success in integrating past observations and learning latent dynamics, to address observation delays in POMDPs. World models learn a latent state representation along with dynamics and observation models. The key insight is that world models reduce delayed POMDPs to delayed MDPs in the latent space. Thus, concepts from delayed MDPs can be combined with world model techniques for POMDPs. 

The authors adapt the model-based RL algorithm Dreamer V3 as a case study. Two main strategies are explored: 1) An extended actor that conditions the policy on the latent state and past actions, converting the problem into an extended MDP, 2) A latent actor that imagines the current latent state and conditions the policy only on that. Additionally, a simpler memoryless actor and an agnostic baseline are evaluated.

Contributions:
- Establish a link between delays in MDPs and POMDPs via world models, allowing novel combinations of techniques
- Propose three methods to incorporate world models into delayed RL 
- Conduct extensive experiments in both vector and visual environments. For the first time, benchmark delayed RL on visual control tasks.
- Demonstrate that world models can effectively handle partial observability under delays, where existing approaches struggle. The extended actor approach improves performance by ~30% over the agnostic baseline.

In summary, this paper pioneers the application of world models to tackle a key practical challenge in RL - observation delays. The proposed techniques offer a simple yet powerful way to achieve delay-robust learning in visually rich and partially observed environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using world models to handle observation delays in partially observable reinforcement learning environments by reducing delayed POMDPs to delayed MDPs in the learned latent space.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing to use world models to address observational delays in partially observable environments (POMDPs). The key insight is that world models can reduce delayed POMDPs to delayed MDPs, allowing existing techniques for delayed MDPs to be applied.

2) Presenting two strategies for adapting the Dreamer model-based RL algorithm to handle delays - an "Extended Actor" that conditions the policy on an extended state containing past actions, and a "Latent Actor" that imagines the current latent state. 

3) Conducting extensive experiments evaluating these strategies on continuous control tasks, including visual environments which had not been previously benchmarked for delayed RL. The results demonstrate improved resilience to delays compared to prior methods and a naive baseline.

4) Formalizing the link between delays in MDPs and POMDPs, allowing concepts from both settings to be combined in a novel way.

In summary, the main contribution is using world models to enable delayed reinforcement learning in partially observable environments, along with empirical validation and formalization of key ideas.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using world models to handle delayed observations in POMDPs. How does utilizing the latent space of a world model help address delays compared to working directly in the observation space? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper discusses reducing a DPOMDP to a DMDP using a world model. Explain this reduction and discuss why handling delays in the latent MDP induced by the world model can be easier compared to tackling delays directly in the POMDP formulation.

3. The Extended actor method utilizes the extended state in the latent space as input to the policy network. Discuss the rationale behind this design and why it can capture the necessary information to act optimally despite delays. What are its limitations?

4. The Latent actor method predicts the current latent state from historical information and uses that to select actions. Explain why this approach may fail to work well for long delays and how errors could accumulate over imagination steps.

5. The Memoryless actor variant relies solely on the last observed latent state without explicitly tracking past actions. Discuss the theoretical justifications for why this could work and also situations where it would fail to capture necessary information.

6. While world models can learn successfully from delayed data, the distribution of samples changes compared to the undelayed setting. Elaborate why this distribution shift occurs and how it could impact various components of the learning process.

7. The results show that the Extended method outperforms a naive baseline by 30% on average. Analyze these results and discuss what factors contribute to its superior performance over alternative strategies.

8. The paper benchmarks delayed RL with visual inputs for the first time. Explain why evaluating delays in visual tasks is crucial and what additional challenges imaging observations introduce. 

9. The Agnostic baseline exhibits some degree of resilience to delays without knowing delay lengths. Speculate on why this approach still succeeds while failing gracefully, and what factors contribute to performance decline as delay increases.

10. The experiments constrain delays to discrete fixed lengths for simplicity. Discuss how the proposed methods could be extended to handle variable, random delays and what modifications would need to be made.
