# [Multi-Directional Subspace Editing in Style-Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we identify meaningful orthogonal subspaces in the latent space of StyleGAN that allow editing of individual facial attributes with minimal changes to other attributes?The key points are:- The paper aims to find disentangled semantic directions in the StyleGAN latent space that control specific facial attributes. - They propose discovering orthogonal subspaces, where each subspace corresponds to one attribute. - Editing within a subspace allows "multi-directional" edits of a single attribute. - Orthogonality between subspaces promotes disentanglement, so changing one attribute does not affect others.- This allows creating a diverse range of edited images by altering vectors in different directions within an attribute's subspace.- They evaluate disentanglement capabilities quantitatively and compare against state-of-the-art image editing techniques.So in summary, the main research question is how to identify orthogonal disentangled subspaces in StyleGAN's latent space to enable controlled editing of facial attributes separately. The key hypothesis is that using orthogonal subspaces will improve disentanglement and editing capabilities compared to prior singular direction models.
