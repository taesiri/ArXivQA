# [An Integrated System for Spatio-Temporal Summarization of 360-degrees   Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02576)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents an integrated system for spatiotemporal summarization of 360-degree videos. The system first classifies if the video was captured with a static or moving camera using a decision mechanism that analyzes phase correlation in different regions. It then employs one of two state-of-the-art saliency detection methods suited for each camera type - ATSal for moving and SST-Sal for static. The detected salient regions are used to form spatio-temporally correlated sub-volumes showing events of interest. These are stitched into a 2D video which is then summarized temporally by a variant of the CA-SUM method trained on 360-degree videos to produce saliency-aware importance scores. Quantitative experiments validate the accuracy of the decision mechanism in selecting suitable saliency detectors. Comparisons on two 360-degree saliency datasets show ATSal performs better on moving camera videos while SST-Sal is superior for static cameras. Qualitative analysis provides further insight into the pros and cons of the saliency methods and shows the trained video summarization approach produces more representative summaries than conventional approaches. The integrated system enables end-to-end spatiotemporal summarization of 360-degree video to create useful condensed overviews.
