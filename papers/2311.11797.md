# [Igniting Language Intelligence: The Hitchhiker's Guide From   Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Language Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11797)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a comprehensive paragraph summarizing the key points of this paper:

This paper provides an in-depth overview of the evolution from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques to the emergence of language agents powered by large language models (LLMs). It investigates the fundamental mechanics of CoT, finding that it works effectively when the LLM has ample parameters and the relevant parametric knowledge pieces are interconnected. CoT identifies and bridges atomic knowledge pieces through intermediate reasoning steps. The paper then explores the paradigm shifts in CoT techniques across prompting patterns, reasoning formats, and application scenarios. For instance, CoT has expanded from manual to automated prompt engineering and from textual formats to structured representations. CoT has also enabled multilingual, multimodal, and general-purpose applications.  Furthermore, the paper chronicles how CoT catalyzes LLMs to understand instructions and interact with environments as language agents. It proposes a conceptual framework encompassing perception, memory, and reasoning for agents. Multimodal perception, memory search structures, and interleaved thought-action iterations can enhance these abilities. Finally, the paper discusses open challenges regarding generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, safety, and evaluation for advancing research on CoT, LLMs, and language agents.
