# [Unlocking Instructive In-Context Learning with Tabular Prompting for   Relational Triple Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13741)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Relational triple extraction (RTE) aims to identify structured information from text. Current in-context learning (ICL) methods for RTE still face two key challenges: (1) how to design effective prompting formats suitable for RTE, and (2) how to select high-quality samples as demonstrations for few-shot prompting.  

- Existing methods typically recast RTE as a text-to-text generation task, which causes a mismatch between pre-training and inference. They also utilize only surface language features for sample selection, lacking consideration of triple semantics.

Proposed Solution:
- A tabular prompting format called \textsc{TableIE} is introduced, which incorporates explicit table structure into prompts. This frames RTE as a table generation task, producing more organized outputs.

- An instructive ICL (I$^2$CL) framework is proposed to select high-quality samples from unlabeled data based on test set, considering triple semantics. 

- A triple-level similarity metric based on Pompeiu-Hausdorff distance is used to measure sample similarities. A retrieval model is trained on pre-extracted unlabeled data to select samples.

- Three sample selection strategies are introduced: top-k based, balance-based, and coverage-based. Each is suitable for different test data distributions.

Contributions:
- \textsc{TableIE} prompting achieves better performance than text-based formats, with lower costs and higher efficiency.

- I$^2$CL consistently improves over baselines by effectively selecting samples as demonstrations for few-shot prompting.

- The proposed similarity metric and selection strategies advance the state-of-the-art in few-shot RTE using ICL.

In summary, this paper introduces an effective tabular prompting design and sample selection framework to advance few-shot RTE through ICL, tackling key challenges in prompt engineering and sample quality.
