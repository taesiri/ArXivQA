# [Enabling Large Language Models to Generate Text with Citations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14627)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we build an open-domain question answering system that provides natural language answers with supporting evidence from textual sources?Specifically, the paper seems focused on developing methods for an end-to-end question answering system that can:1) Retrieve relevant textual passages from a large corpus to answer natural language questions.2) Synthesize the information from the retrieved passages into a natural language answer. 3) Provide citations to the passages within the answer text to ground the claims made.The authors propose and evaluate different methods for retrieval, answer generation, and citation within such an end-to-end open-domain QA system. The key research questions appear to be:- How should the system retrieve evidence passages given a natural language question?- How should the system incorporate and synthesize multiple retrieved passages into a concise, coherent answer? - How can the system provide citations to the evidence sources within the answer text?- How can we automatically evaluate the overall quality of such systems on dimensions like fluency, correctness, and appropriate citation?So in summary, the main research focus seems to be on techniques for building end-to-end open-domain QA systems that can provide explanatory answers with citations to textual evidence, and evaluating such systems automatically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. They propose a new method for text generation called masked language modeling (MLM). MLM randomly masks some percentage of the input tokens and then trains the model to predict the original tokens at those masked positions. This allows the model to learn good representations of text.2. They show that pre-training a Transformer model using MLM on a large corpus yields state-of-the-art results on multiple downstream NLP tasks like question answering, textual entailment, sentiment analysis etc.3. They demonstrate that the MLM pre-training objective is particularly effective for learning bidirectional representations compared to left-to-right language model pre-training. MLM helps the model learn contextual representations by looking at words in context from both directions.4. They release BERT - Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, which is a pre-trained Transformer model using MLM. They show that BERT outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on various tasks with minimal task-specific architecture modifications.5. They analyze BERT representations and show they encode both syntactic and semantic information about the input text. They also analyze the effect of different hyperparameter choices.In summary, the key innovations of the paper are proposing masked language modeling for pre-training, releasing pretrained BERT models and showing their effectiveness on multiple NLP tasks, and analyzing the learned representations. The pretrained BERT models have had a big impact on advancing NLP.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing better retrieval systems and strategies for integrating retrieval into language models. The paper shows there is still substantial room to improve retrieval quality and retrieval-augmented language generation.- Building long-context language models. The experiments demonstrate current models struggle to incorporate multiple documents due to limited context sizes. Developing models that can process longer context would be beneficial.- Advancing language models' ability to synthesize information from multiple documents. The paper finds current models struggle to faithfully integrate facts from multiple documents. Improving multi-document reasoning is an important challenge. - Training models to generate text with citations, rather than just prompting. The authors note the lack of supervised training data currently, but suggest collected human-written examples that demonstrate citing could allow for directly training models to generate citations.- Evaluating models on more complex reasoning tasks. The current datasets focus on simpler fact-based questions. Testing citation generation on tasks requiring mathematical reasoning, multi-hop reasoning, etc. is an interesting direction.- Developing better automatic evaluation methods, especially for citation quality. The paper discusses limitations of the current metrics, like handling partial citation support. Improving evaluation to align better with human judgments is an open area.In summary, the key suggestions are advancing retrieval, long-context modeling, multi-document reasoning, training with citation demonstrations, evaluating on harder tasks, and improving automatic evaluation. Advancing these areas would substantially improve the capability of language models to accurately cite sources when answering questions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new method for few-shot learning that combines meta-learning with language modeling. The key idea is to leverage the knowledge stored in large pre-trained language models like BERT to rapidly adapt to new tasks from just a few examples. The model consists of a standard BERT-based encoder and a task-specific classifier head. During meta-training, the encoder parameters are learned across a distribution of NLP tasks while the classifier head is re-initialized and trained separately for each task. This allows the encoder to develop general linguistic representations that can be fine-tuned quickly for new tasks. At meta-test time, the pretrained encoder is frozen and only the classifier head is updated for adaptation on the few examples of a new task. Experiments on few-shot text classification, sequence labeling, and sentence pair modeling show significant improvements over previous meta-learning methods. By incorporating knowledge from pre-trained language models, the proposed approach is able to efficiently adapt and generalize from extremely limited labeled data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the given paper:The paper proposes a new model called the Transformer-XL for sequence learning tasks like language modeling and machine translation. The key innovation is a novel neural architecture that enables learning long-term dependencies in sequences without sacrificing computational efficiency. The Transformer-XL incorporates a segment-level memory that allows it to store representations from previous segments. By re-using these past hidden states, the model is able to build connections between the current segment and relevant context from thousands of steps earlier. Experiments demonstrate strong improvements on multiple benchmarks. For example, the Transformer-XL obtains state-of-the-art results on enwiki8, text8, and WikiText-103, outperforming previous models like LSTM-based RNNs and the original Transformer. Overall, the Transformer-XL represents an important advance in being able to model much longer sequences than previously possible.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The authors propose a new self-supervised pretraining objective called Masked Region Modeling (MRM) for vision transformers. MRM randomly masks out local regions in an image and trains the model to recover the missing regions based on the surrounding visual context. Specifically, random square regions of an input image are masked out, and the model is trained to predict the masked content by looking at the surrounding visible parts of the image. The authors show that pretraining vision transformers with MRM improves downstream task performance compared to pretrained models like BEiT. A key advantage of MRM is that it encourages the model to build an understanding of spatial relations and local semantics in images. By training the model to inpaint masked image regions using visual context, MRM helps the model learn useful visual representations for downstream tasks.
