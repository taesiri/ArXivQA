# [360DVD: Controllable Panorama Video Generation with 360-Degree Video   Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06578)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- 360-degree panoramic videos offer immersive experiences but are costly to capture in real life. Generating such videos is useful but challenging as existing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models struggle to handle the differences in content distribution and motion patterns compared to standard videos.

Proposed Method: 
- The paper proposes a controllable 360-degree video generation pipeline called 360DVD. It leverages a lightweight 360-Adapter module along with 360 Enhancement Techniques to transform standard T2V models into generating high-quality panoramic videos based on text prompts and optional motion guidance.

- The 360-Adapter receives motion conditions and outputs modulated features to feed into the diffusion model encoder, adapting it to the panorama domain without altering its generative capabilities.

- The 360 Enhancement Techniques include a latitude-aware loss to focus more on lower distortion regions, a latent rotation mechanism to enhance left-right continuity macroscopically, and a circular padding scheme for pixel-level continuity.

- A new panoramic video dataset WEB360 with enhanced captions using 360 Text Fusion based on multiple narrow-FoV images and ChatGPT is collected to train the model.

Contributions:
- Proposes the first diffusion model based method for controllable text-conditioned 360-degree panoramic video generation.

- Introduces effective components including 360-Adapter and 360 Enhancement Techniques to transform standard T2V models into panoramic video generation while preserving their priors.

- Constructs a new high-quality panoramic video dataset WEB360 with detailed text descriptions using 360 Text Fusion.

- Experiments demonstrate the ability to generate diverse, high-quality and controllable panoramic videos superior to baseline approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes 360DVD, a controllable 360-degree video diffusion model that leverages a lightweight 360-Adapter module and 360 Enhancement Techniques to transform standard text-to-video models into panorama video generators that can create high-quality, coherent 360-degree videos conditioned on text prompts and motion guidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would summarize the main contributions as:

1. Proposing 360DVD, a controllable 360-degree panorama video generation diffusion model. 360DVD transforms pre-trained text-to-video models to generate panorama videos using a lightweight 360-Adapter module and assisted 360 Enhancement Techniques.

2. Designing 360 Enhancement Techniques including a latitude-aware loss and two mechanisms to enhance the content and motion quality of generated panorama videos.

3. Introducing a new high-quality dataset named WEB360 comprising ~2,000 panoramic videos, with each video accompanied by a detailed caption enhanced through a proposed 360 Text Fusion method.

4. Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate 360DVD's effectiveness in creating high-quality, diverse, and consistent 360-degree panorama videos based on textual prompts and optional motion guidance.

In summary, the key innovation is proposing a full pipeline leveraging diffusion models to generate controllable and high-quality panorama videos, which contrasts with prior work that focused almost exclusively on panorama image generation. The introduction of the new WEB360 dataset and 360 Text Fusion method also aim to spur progress in this direction.
