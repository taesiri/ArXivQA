# [Global and Local Prompts Cooperation via Optimal Transport for Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Global and Local Prompts Cooperation via Optimal Transport for Federated Learning":

Problem:
- Federated learning allows decentralized collaboration between clients without sharing their local private data. However, current federated learning methods have high communication costs and lack the ability to handle heterogeneous data distributions across clients (both label shift and feature shift).

- Although vision-language models like CLIP have shown promising capabilities, directly training CLIP under the federated setting remains challenging due to the substantial communication overhead. Prompt learning adapts such models to downstream tasks via only learning additional prompt parameters, enabling efficient federated prompt learning.

- Despite recent progress, existing federated prompt methods still lack specialized designs to systematically address severe data heterogeneity issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called FedOTP that introduces efficient collaborative prompt learning strategies to capture diverse category traits on a per-client basis. 

- Specifically, for each client, FedOTP learns a global prompt to extract consensus knowledge among clients, and a local prompt to capture client-specific characteristics. 

- It then employs Unbalanced Optimal Transport (relaxing one equality constraint) to align local visual features with global and local prompts, striking a balance between consensus and personalization.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore the mechanism of prompts' cooperation in federated learning under severe data heterogeneity.

- Proposes FedOTP, a federated learning framework utilizing unbalanced OT to enhance the collaboration between global and local prompts, effectively addressing both label shift and feature shift.

- Experiments on various datasets demonstrate FedOTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Visualizations also showcase FedOTP's ability to balance consensus & personalization.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions regarding specialized federated prompt learning tailored for personalized learning, with a novel global-local prompt cooperation mechanism via optimal transport. Experiments verify its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning framework called FedOTP that trains both a global and a local prompt for each client and uses unbalanced optimal transport to align local visual features with these prompts to effectively address data heterogeneity characterized by domain discrepancy and imbalanced class distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors propose a federated learning framework called FedOTP (Federated Prompts Cooperation via Optimal Transport) that introduces efficient collaborative prompt learning strategies to capture diverse category traits on a per-client basis. Specifically, each client learns a global prompt to extract consensus knowledge among clients, and a local prompt to capture client-specific category characteristics.

2. FedOTP utilizes unbalanced Optimal Transport to align local visual features with the global and local prompts, striking a balance between global consensus and local personalization. This allows FedOTP to effectively deal with severe data heterogeneity characterized by domain discrepancy and imbalanced class distributions. 

3. Through extensive experiments on datasets with various types of heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that FedOTP outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning methods. The results verify the effectiveness of the global-local prompt cooperation mechanism via optimal transport in FedOTP.

4. Visualization results confirm that the global prompts in FedOTP concentrate on common features among clients while the local prompts capture individual client-specific details. This shows the ability of FedOTP to balance consensus and personalization.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a novel federated learning framework FedOTP that introduces global-local prompt cooperation via optimal transport to address data heterogeneity across clients. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative visualizations verify its effectiveness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Federated learning - The paper proposes a federated learning framework called FedOTP. Federated learning is a distributed machine learning approach that enables model training on decentralized data.

- Prompt learning - The paper explores integrating prompt learning, which adapts pretrained models like CLIP to downstream tasks by training small prompt parameters, into federated learning.

- Global and local prompts - The key idea of FedOTP is training both a global prompt to capture consensus knowledge and a personalized local prompt for each client to learn client-specific traits.

- Optimal transport (OT) - FedOTP utilizes unbalanced optimal transport to align local visual features with the global and local prompts to balance consensus and personalization.

- Data heterogeneity - The paper aims to address severe data heterogeneity in federated learning, including label shift (imbalanced class distributions) and feature shift (domain discrepancies).

- Personalized federated learning (PFL) - By training personalized local prompts, FedOTP can effectively perform personalized federated learning to adapt to heterogeneous statistical distributions across clients.

In summary, the key focus is using optimal transport to enable cooperation between global and local prompts in order to perform robust personalized federated learning in the presence of heterogeneous data.
