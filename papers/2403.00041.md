# [Global and Local Prompts Cooperation via Optimal Transport for Federated   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00041)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Global and Local Prompts Cooperation via Optimal Transport for Federated Learning":

Problem:
- Federated learning allows decentralized collaboration between clients without sharing their local private data. However, current federated learning methods have high communication costs and lack the ability to handle heterogeneous data distributions across clients (both label shift and feature shift).

- Although vision-language models like CLIP have shown promising capabilities, directly training CLIP under the federated setting remains challenging due to the substantial communication overhead. Prompt learning adapts such models to downstream tasks via only learning additional prompt parameters, enabling efficient federated prompt learning.

- Despite recent progress, existing federated prompt methods still lack specialized designs to systematically address severe data heterogeneity issues.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel framework called FedOTP that introduces efficient collaborative prompt learning strategies to capture diverse category traits on a per-client basis. 

- Specifically, for each client, FedOTP learns a global prompt to extract consensus knowledge among clients, and a local prompt to capture client-specific characteristics. 

- It then employs Unbalanced Optimal Transport (relaxing one equality constraint) to align local visual features with global and local prompts, striking a balance between consensus and personalization.

Main Contributions:
- First work to explore the mechanism of prompts' cooperation in federated learning under severe data heterogeneity.

- Proposes FedOTP, a federated learning framework utilizing unbalanced OT to enhance the collaboration between global and local prompts, effectively addressing both label shift and feature shift.

- Experiments on various datasets demonstrate FedOTP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Visualizations also showcase FedOTP's ability to balance consensus & personalization.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions regarding specialized federated prompt learning tailored for personalized learning, with a novel global-local prompt cooperation mechanism via optimal transport. Experiments verify its effectiveness.
