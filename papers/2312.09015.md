# [Uncertainty in GNN Learning Evaluations: A Comparison Between Measures   for Quantifying Randomness in GNN Community Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09015)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper addresses issues with the evaluation of graph neural network (GNN) models for community detection, which is an important unsupervised learning task with applications across domains. The authors demonstrate that inconsistencies in evaluation procedures, like failing to optimize hyperparameters and not accounting for randomness, can produce misleading results that impede understanding and progress. They propose a framework for more consistent evaluation and compare optimized versus default hyperparameters for several models, revealing significantly better performance with optimization. To quantify randomness, they analyze different ranking consistency metrics, identifying the Wasserstein distance-based metric as most robust. Key conclusions are that standardized evaluation procedures are critical for reliable benchmarks, hyperparameter optimization markedly impacts comparisons, and properly measuring ranking randomness allows assessing result consistency. Overall, this thoughtful analysis highlights current evaluation weaknesses in GNN community detection and provides constructive solutions towards improved, transparent assessments that can better inform research and adoption of methods.
