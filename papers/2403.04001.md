# [Bidirectional Progressive Neural Networks with Episodic Return Progress   for Emergent Task Sequencing and Robotic Skill Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Developing lifelong learning capabilities in robots that allow them to autonomously acquire new skills over time is an important challenge. Key aspects lacking in current machine learning methods include the ability to learn skills in an interleaved manner (as humans do) and enable bidirectional transfer of skills among tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new multi-task reinforcement learning framework called "Episodic Return Progress with Bidirectional Progressive Neural Networks (ERP-BPNN)". It has two main components:
  1) Bidirectional Progressive Neural Network (BPNN) architecture: Allows bidirectional skill transfer among task-specific modules without catastrophic forgetting. This enables positive transfer of knowledge in both forward and backward directions without requiring sequential mastering of tasks.
  2) Episodic Return Progress (ERP) intrinsic motivation signal: Guides autonomous task switching during training by selecting at each step the task that has shown the most learning progress recently. This results in emergent interleaved learning.

Key Contributions:
- Novel BPNN architecture that enables online bidirectional skill transfer among tasks, unlike prior progressive networks that only allow forward transfer after sequential convergence on tasks.
- New ERP intrinsic motivation signal for guiding task switching by detecting learning progress. Results in human-like emergent interleaved training.  
- Application of the framework to enable learning and skill transfer of reaching skills among morphologically different robots (2-DOF to 4-DOF arms).
- Systematic evaluation showing faster convergence and improved performance of ERP-BPNN across multiple metrics compared to baselines.

In summary, the key novelty is in allowing human-inspired autonomous interleaved multi-task learning with bidirectional skill transfer among tasks for lifelong robot learning. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the approach for transfer learning among physically different robots.
