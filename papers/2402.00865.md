## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing feature shaping methods for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection rely on rules manually designed for specific model architectures and OOD datasets. This limits their generalization ability across different models and datasets. The paper aims to develop a more generalizable feature shaping method for OOD detection.

Proposed Solution:
1. The paper first formulates an abstract optimization framework to encompass all feature shaping methods for OOD detection. The framework involves finding a shaping function that maximizes some detection performance measure.

2. A concrete instance of the framework is then proposed with a piecewise constant shaping function. An optimization objective is formulated to maximize the expected difference between maximum logit values for in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. 

3. Through analysis, the paper shows that existing methods like ReAct, BFAct and VRA-P approximate the optimal shaping function obtained by solving the proposed optimization problem.

4. Further, a novel method is proposed to optimize the shaping function using only ID data, by removing the OOD-related term in the optimization objective. A closed-form solution is derived.

Main Contributions:
1. Provides an optimization view to understand and compare existing feature shaping methods.

2. Proposes a new feature shaping method that can be optimized using only ID data and achieves strong OOD detection performance across diverse datasets and model architectures.

3. Comprehensive experiments highlight limitations of existing methods on new datasets and models. The proposed method generalizes better.

4. Analysis provides insights into the effect of different feature values for OOD detection, explaining the form of optimal shaping function.

In summary, the paper develops a principled optimization framework for feature shaping and uses it to design a novel method that generalizes well across models and datasets for OOD detection.
