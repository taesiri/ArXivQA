# [FineControlNet: Fine-level Text Control for Image Generation with   Spatially Aligned Text Control Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09252)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces FineControlNet, a novel method for fine-grained control over image generation using both text prompts and spatial constraints like human poses. It allows controlling the appearance and identity of individual instances in an image through instance-specific text prompts aligned to corresponding poses. During diffusion model inversion, embeddings of text prompts and poses are separated, conditioned in parallel on copies of the latent vector, and composited using pose-derived attention masks, enabling distinct text control per instance. Experiments demonstrate superior instance-level text consistency over baselines, with graceful performance declines given high instance counts or spatial overlap. Qualitative results showcase controlled generation of multiple people with specified identities harmonized within coherent scenes. By spatially aligning text to geometry in latent space, FineControlNet pushes state-of-the-art text-to-image generation towards more detailed user control. Limitations like implausible scenes and misaligned poses highlight opportunities for future work.
