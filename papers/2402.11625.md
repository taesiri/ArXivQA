# [SpeCrawler: Generating OpenAPI Specifications from API Documentation   Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Manually creating OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) for REST APIs is labor-intensive. At the same time, online API documentation websites have heterogeneous structures and formats, making it challenging to automatically generate OAS from them. Prior rule-based methods have faced difficulties in generalizing across diverse API documentations.  

Proposed Solution - SpeCrawler:
The paper proposes SpeCrawler, a multi-stage system to generate comprehensive OAS automatically from online API documentation webpages. It combines rule-based algorithms and large language models (LLMs).

Key stages:
1) Scraping - Extract all API request-response example pairs from webpages using rules and heuristics. 
2) Base OAS Generation - Use LLM to create a skeleton OAS structure from request examples. Break down generation into smaller tasks for better performance.
3) Enrichment - Extract relevant API descriptions from webpages and use LLM to generate structured data to enrich base OAS. Customize output format for requests (TSV) and responses (JSON) based on their nature.

The carefully designed pipeline and decomposition into subtasks enable SpeCrawler to generalize across heterogeneous API documentations by leveraging capabilities of LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- A novel end-to-end system SpeCrawler to automatically create comprehensive OAS from diverse API documentation webpages
- Empirical analysis highlighting LLMs' ability to overcome variety in API documentations by using subtask decomposition and customized output formats
- Comparative assessment showing enhanced precision and recall over other LLM-based solutions

The system significantly reduces manual effort in crafting OAS, aiding streamlined integration across API-driven systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces SpeCrawler, a multi-stage system that combines rule-based algorithms and large language models to automatically generate comprehensive OpenAPI Specifications from diverse API documentation websites.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is introducing SpeCrawler, an innovative multi-stage methodology designed to automatically generate comprehensive OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) from online API documentation. Specifically:

- SpeCrawler combines rule-based algorithms and generative large language models (LLMs) to address limitations of LLMs while showing robustness and generalization capabilities across varied HTML structures in API documentation. 

- It is a comprehensive system that utilizes LLMs to generate OAS from diverse API documentation through a carefully crafted pipeline involving scraping, base OAS generation, and enrichment stages. 

- By creating a standardized OAS format for numerous APIs, SpeCrawler aims to streamline integration processes within API orchestrating systems and facilitate incorporating tools into LLMs.

- The paper demonstrates SpeCrawler's efficacy through empirical evidence and case studies, leveraging capabilities of LLMs to handle heterogeneous API documentation.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing SpeCrawler as an automatic solution to generate OAS from API documentation by harnessing LLMs, showing improved performance over existing rule-based and machine learning approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions dividing the OpenAPI specification (OAS) generation into multiple subtasks. What were these subtasks and what was the rationale behind this design choice? 

2. The scraping stage identifies request-response pairs from API documentation. What techniques were used to align requests to responses given that a single page may document multiple APIs?

3. When generating the base OAS, the paper breaks down request/response examples into segments based on line thresholds. How were suitable thresholds determined? What impact would this have on the quality of the generated OAS?

4. Enrichment relies on extracting a minimal HTML scope containing key information. What were the ranking criteria used by the algorithm to select the best scope among candidates? How robust is this to variations in webpage structure?

5. During enrichment generation, why was a TSV format chosen for requests and a JSON schema format chosen for responses? What are the tradeoffs of each representation? 

6. When selecting in-context examples for the LLMs, HTML tag frequency distributions were used to measure similarity. Why this choice of metric? Would other measures like DOM tree distance also be reasonable?

7. For the end-to-end evaluation, what are some likely sources of noise in the human-annotated dataset used? How significantly could this impact conclusions about relative LLM performance?

8. The Granite model performed better than competitors without specialized tuning. To what architectural factors of this model might this be attributed? What prompts future investigation?

9. Compared to baseline approaches, where does the SpeCrawler pipeline offer the most significant advantages? Is further refinement of individual stages needed to realize the full potential? 

10. The paper discusses applicability for generating OpenAPI specs of tools used with LLMs. What unique challenges exist in this domain? Would the methodology proposed translate effectively?
