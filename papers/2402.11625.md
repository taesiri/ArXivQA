# [SpeCrawler: Generating OpenAPI Specifications from API Documentation   Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11625)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Manually creating OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) for REST APIs is labor-intensive. At the same time, online API documentation websites have heterogeneous structures and formats, making it challenging to automatically generate OAS from them. Prior rule-based methods have faced difficulties in generalizing across diverse API documentations.  

Proposed Solution - SpeCrawler:
The paper proposes SpeCrawler, a multi-stage system to generate comprehensive OAS automatically from online API documentation webpages. It combines rule-based algorithms and large language models (LLMs).

Key stages:
1) Scraping - Extract all API request-response example pairs from webpages using rules and heuristics. 
2) Base OAS Generation - Use LLM to create a skeleton OAS structure from request examples. Break down generation into smaller tasks for better performance.
3) Enrichment - Extract relevant API descriptions from webpages and use LLM to generate structured data to enrich base OAS. Customize output format for requests (TSV) and responses (JSON) based on their nature.

The carefully designed pipeline and decomposition into subtasks enable SpeCrawler to generalize across heterogeneous API documentations by leveraging capabilities of LLMs.

Main Contributions:
- A novel end-to-end system SpeCrawler to automatically create comprehensive OAS from diverse API documentation webpages
- Empirical analysis highlighting LLMs' ability to overcome variety in API documentations by using subtask decomposition and customized output formats
- Comparative assessment showing enhanced precision and recall over other LLM-based solutions

The system significantly reduces manual effort in crafting OAS, aiding streamlined integration across API-driven systems.
