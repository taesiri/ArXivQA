# [Learning 3D-aware Image Synthesis with Unknown Pose Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07702)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis without relying on pre-estimated 3D pose distributions? 

The key hypothesis is that by designing a pose-free generator that can infer poses directly from latent codes, along with a pose-aware discriminator, it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art 3D-aware image generation without needing any pose priors.

In summary, the paper aims to remove the dependence on pose priors in existing 3D-aware image synthesis methods, which often require careful tuning of pose distributions or pose annotations. By inferring poses directly from latent codes, the proposed method called PoF3D can learn to approximate the true underlying pose distribution in a dataset automatically during adversarial training.
