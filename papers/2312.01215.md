# [RNb-NeuS: Reflectance and Normal-based Multi-View 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01215)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Multi-view stereo (MVS) methods are good at reconstructing 3D geometry but struggle with non-Lambertian surfaces and lack of textures. In contrast, photometric stereo (PS) methods excel at recovering high-frequency details and material properties but have poor low-frequency geometry. 

Recently proposed multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) methods try to get the best of both worlds by jointly solving MVS and PS in a multi-objective optimization. However, conflicting objectives can lead to losing high-frequency details.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a simpler approach to MVPS by decoupling MVS and PS. High-quality reflectance and normal maps are first obtained per view using state-of-the-art PS methods. These maps are then fused through a novel reparameterization that combines them into vectors of simulated radiances under varying illumination.

The reparameterized radiances are integrated as input data into a neural volume rendering pipeline based on signed distance functions. This allows optimizing a single objective for reconstructing a 3D surface that best explains the simulated radiances while regularizing the geometry.

Main Contributions:

- A reflectance and normal reparameterization that enables their seamless integration as input data in neural volume rendering, avoiding conflicting optimization objectives.

- First approach to exploit reflectance as an additional prior in MVPS.

- Flexible paradigm compatible with any PS method, calibrated or uncalibrated.

- State-of-the-art quantitative results on the DiLiGenT-MV benchmark, with unprecedented level of high-frequency detail reconstruction. Significantly improved performance on high curvature and low visibility areas.

- Conceptual simplicity, yet remarkably high performance compared to recent complex deep MVPS techniques.
