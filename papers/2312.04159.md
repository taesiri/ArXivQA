# [Zero-Touch Networks: Towards Next-Generation Network Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04159)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Zero-Touch Networks (ZTNs) and Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) within the context of 5G and Beyond (5G+) networks. As next-generation networks grow more complex, traditional manual approaches for management become inefficient. Accordingly, ZSM has emerged as an automated management solution to optimize network performance through techniques like machine learning. However, ZSM faces challenges like effective model selection and tuning. To address this, the paper explores automated machine learning (AutoML) which automates the machine learning pipeline, increasing efficiency. A case study demonstrates an online AutoML pipeline predicting 5G application throughput, outperforming ML approaches and adapting to traffic changes. This facilitates automated network service management, improving service quality. While ZSM shows promise across domains like resource allocation, traffic control, energy efficiency and security, refinements are needed. Nonetheless, ZSM and AutoML will play a key role in enabling next-generation networks to fulfill future demands. The paper provides a holistic analysis of ZTN applications, ML challenges, potential solutions like AutoML, and future research directions.
