# [Building Guardrails for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01822)

## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this paper include:

- Guardrails - The core technology focused on in the paper for safeguarding and filtering LLMs. Discussed extensively. 

- Large language models (LLMs) - The AI models that guardrails aim to safeguard. Central topic.

- Requirements - Categories like unintended responses, fairness, privacy, and uncertainty/hallucinations that guardrails need to address. 

- Conflicting requirements - Guardrails need to balance properties like safety and intelligence/creativity. 

- Systematic approach - The paper advocates for carefully building guardrails using rigorous software engineering processes.

- Neural-symbolic methods - Advanced techniques proposed for implementing complex guardrail requirements.

- Multidisciplinary collaboration - Needed to properly determine context-specific guardrail requirements.

- Sociotechnical theory - Cited framework for bringing together social and technical considerations.

- Verification and testing - Crucial for ensuring guardrail quality according to standards.

In summary, key terms cover guardrails themselves, the models they safeguard, the requirements they implement, the systematic approach to build them, the techniques to realize them, and the processes to assure them.
