# [JointMotion: Joint Self-supervision for Joint Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Motion prediction for autonomous driving is to predict the future trajectories of traffic agents. Most recent approaches perform marginal prediction, predicting trajectories for each agent individually. 
- Joint motion prediction aims to model interactions between agents by predicting a joint set of trajectories for all agents in a scene. However, joint prediction requires learning complex scene-wide representations.

Method:
- The paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method called "JointMotion" to accelerate and improve joint motion prediction. 
- It has two complementary SSL objectives:
   1) Scene-level objective: Matches embeddings of all motion sequences in a scene to the environment context embedding (e.g. map, traffic lights). This connects likely motions to environments.
   2) Instance-level objective: Reconstructs masked elements of motion sequences, lanes, traffic lights from non-masked elements. This refines representations.
- The instance-level modeling uses a complete set of 10 agent features (position, dimensions, acceleration etc.) unlike prior work.   

Contributions:
- Show that explicit scene-level SSL objectives outperform implicit ones for joint prediction.
- The two objectives are complementary and combining them works best.
- JointMotion outperforms recent contrastive and autoencoding SSL methods for motion prediction.
- It improves state-of-the-art joint prediction methods like Scene Transformer, HPTR and Wayformer by 3-11% on metrics like minFDE.
- Enables effective transfer learning between two benchmark datasets.

Main highlights:
- Novel SSL method with scene and instance-level objectives tailored for joint motion prediction
- Significantly outperforms prior SSL techniques and SOTA models for the task
- Enables learning complex scene-wide representations required for modeling interactions


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a self-supervised learning method for joint motion prediction of multiple agents in autonomous driving, with complementary scene-level and instance-level objectives that connect motion sequences to environment context and perform masked reconstruction to refine representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A scene-level self-supervised learning objective that connects motion and environments via similarity learning. This aims to learn a joint embedding space for motion sequences and environment context so that the model implicitly learns which motion is likely in a given environment, including traffic rules and interaction amongst agents.

2. A complementary instance-level objective of masked instance modeling that refines the learned representations. This reconstructs masked elements of motion sequences, lane polylines, and traffic light states from non-masked elements and environment context. It uses a more complete set of object features compared to prior work, including agent dimensions, orientation, speed/acceleration profiles etc.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal of these two complementary self-supervised pre-training objectives that accelerate training and improve precision of motion prediction models. The combination of the scene-level and instance-level objectives is shown to outperform prior pre-training methods like contrastive learning or autoencoding approaches.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The proposed method has two complementary self-supervised learning objectives: connecting motion and environments, and masked instance modeling. Can you explain in detail how each of these objectives works and how they are complementary?

2. The connecting motion and environments objective matches embeddings of motion sequences and environment context. What encoders are used to generate these embeddings and how exactly is the similarity between them maximized?

3. The masked instance modeling objective reconstructs masked elements of motion sequences, lane polylines, and traffic light states. What are the key differences between the features reconstructed in this method compared to prior work like Traj-MAE and Forecast-MAE?

4. How does the masked instance modeling objective differ in its implementation for models that use late fusion versus early fusion of multimodal encoder outputs? Can you explain the decoder architectures used in each case?

5. Why is transfer learning between datasets like Waymo and Argoverse challenging for motion prediction models? How does the proposed method enable more effective transfer learning between these datasets?

6. How exactly does the proposed method model interaction between agents during joint motion prediction? Does it have any limitations in terms of modeling complex multi-agent interactions?

7. The experiments compare the proposed method against contrastive (PreTraM) and autoencoding (Traj-MAE, Forecast-MAE) pre-training objectives. What are the key differences in results and which objective performs the best overall?

8. For the experiment training Scene Transformer models, what scheduling is used for pre-training versus fine-tuning? How do the compute resources used for pre-training and fine-tuning compare?

9. When evaluating on the WOMD dataset, what post-processing technique is used to adjust predicted confidences? Why is this an important step for joint motion prediction?

10. How competitive is the proposed method against recent state-of-the-art techniques for joint motion prediction like GameFormer and MotionDiffuser? What are some areas where further improvements could be made?
