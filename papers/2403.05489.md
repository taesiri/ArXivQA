# [JointMotion: Joint Self-supervision for Joint Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05489)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Motion prediction for autonomous driving is to predict the future trajectories of traffic agents. Most recent approaches perform marginal prediction, predicting trajectories for each agent individually. 
- Joint motion prediction aims to model interactions between agents by predicting a joint set of trajectories for all agents in a scene. However, joint prediction requires learning complex scene-wide representations.

Method:
- The paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method called "JointMotion" to accelerate and improve joint motion prediction. 
- It has two complementary SSL objectives:
   1) Scene-level objective: Matches embeddings of all motion sequences in a scene to the environment context embedding (e.g. map, traffic lights). This connects likely motions to environments.
   2) Instance-level objective: Reconstructs masked elements of motion sequences, lanes, traffic lights from non-masked elements. This refines representations.
- The instance-level modeling uses a complete set of 10 agent features (position, dimensions, acceleration etc.) unlike prior work.   

Contributions:
- Show that explicit scene-level SSL objectives outperform implicit ones for joint prediction.
- The two objectives are complementary and combining them works best.
- JointMotion outperforms recent contrastive and autoencoding SSL methods for motion prediction.
- It improves state-of-the-art joint prediction methods like Scene Transformer, HPTR and Wayformer by 3-11% on metrics like minFDE.
- Enables effective transfer learning between two benchmark datasets.

Main highlights:
- Novel SSL method with scene and instance-level objectives tailored for joint motion prediction
- Significantly outperforms prior SSL techniques and SOTA models for the task
- Enables learning complex scene-wide representations required for modeling interactions
