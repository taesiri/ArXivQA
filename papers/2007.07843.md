# [Few-shot Scene-adaptive Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the introduction, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to perform effective anomaly detection in videos of a new scene using only a few example frames from that scene. The key ideas are:- Most existing anomaly detection methods require a large amount of training data from each specific scene and do not generalize well to new scenes. - The authors propose a new problem formulation called "few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection" where the goal is to adapt an anomaly detection model to a new target scene using only a few example frames.- They propose a meta-learning based approach to tackle this problem. The model is trained on multiple scenes during meta-training. This allows it to learn how to quickly adapt to a new scene with few examples.- During meta-testing, the model can be adapted to a new target scene with just a few frames, and then perform anomaly detection on the remaining videos from that scene.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a meta-learning approach can enable effective few-shot adaptation of anomaly detection models to new scenes/datasets. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on multiple datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces a new problem called few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection. This is motivated by limitations of previous anomaly detection methods, which require a large amount of training data from each target scene and have limited generalization abilities. The proposed new problem aims to detect anomalies in a new scene using only a few frames from that scene.2. It proposes a novel meta-learning based approach to solve this new problem. The key idea is to train a model on a variety of scenes/tasks during meta-training, so it learns how to quickly adapt to a new target scene using just a few examples. 3. It demonstrates through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets that the proposed approach significantly outperforms alternative methods on few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection. For example, it shows over 20% improvement in AUC compared to baselines.4. It proposes a new backbone network architecture based on generative models and sequential modeling using convolutional LSTM and adversarial training. This is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard anomaly detection benchmarks.In summary, the main contribution is introducing and providing an effective solution to a new problem setting called few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection, which is highly relevant for real-world deployment of anomaly detection systems. The proposed meta-learning approach is shown to substantially improve over alternatives.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a new few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection problem for video surveillance, where the goal is to quickly adapt an anomaly detection model to a new target scene using only a few example frames, and presents a meta-learning based approach to learn how to adapt models effectively with few target scene samples.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research in the field of anomaly detection in videos:- The paper introduces a new problem formulation called "few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection" which aims to detect anomalies in a new scene using only a small number of example frames from that scene. This is a practically useful setting not explored in prior work. - Most prior anomaly detection methods assume training and test data come from the same distribution/scene. This paper shows experimentally that performance drops significantly when a model trained on one scene is applied to a new unseen scene.- The proposed meta-learning approach for few-shot scene adaptation is novel. The idea of using videos from multiple scenes during meta-training to learn how to adapt is creative. To my knowledge, no prior work has applied meta-learning for video anomaly detection across scenes.- The backbone architecture (r-GAN) proposed for the anomaly detection model leverages recent advances like GANs and ConvLSTM. It outperforms a prior state-of-the-art method by Liu et al. This represents an improvement in video anomaly detection itself, beyond the meta-learning contribution.- The comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed meta-learning approach for few-shot adaptation. The method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches. Especially impressive are the big gains in cross-dataset testing.- The idea of quick scene adaptation with few examples could be applicable for other video analysis tasks beyond anomaly detection. This could be an interesting future direction to explore.In summary, this paper makes multiple strong contributions - a new problem setup closer to real applications, a novel meta-learning approach for this problem, an improved anomaly detection backbone architecture, and extensive experiments showing significant gains. The new problem formulation and the effectiveness of the meta-learning idea are the most novel aspects in my opinion compared to prior anomaly detection work.
