# [Few-shot Scene-adaptive Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07843)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the introduction, the central research question addressed in this paper is how to perform effective anomaly detection in videos of a new scene using only a few example frames from that scene. The key ideas are:- Most existing anomaly detection methods require a large amount of training data from each specific scene and do not generalize well to new scenes. - The authors propose a new problem formulation called "few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection" where the goal is to adapt an anomaly detection model to a new target scene using only a few example frames.- They propose a meta-learning based approach to tackle this problem. The model is trained on multiple scenes during meta-training. This allows it to learn how to quickly adapt to a new scene with few examples.- During meta-testing, the model can be adapted to a new target scene with just a few frames, and then perform anomaly detection on the remaining videos from that scene.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that a meta-learning approach can enable effective few-shot adaptation of anomaly detection models to new scenes/datasets. The paper aims to demonstrate this through experiments on multiple datasets.
