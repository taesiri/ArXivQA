## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates privacy-aware energy consumption modeling for connected battery electric vehicles (BEVs) using federated learning (FL) methods. The authors implement and evaluate various FL algorithms, including FedAvg and FedPer, on data from 10 BEVs under simulated real-world driving conditions. They find that the FedAvg-LSTM model achieves the best performance, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) of the prediction by up to 67.84% compared to baseline models. The impact of different experimental parameters like number of iterations, data splitting ratio, and input data size are analyzed. Decentralized FL approaches are also explored by testing on good and weak performing models, demonstrating the efficacy of FL for this task. The proposed methods enable improved energy consumption predictions while maintaining user privacy. Their framework leverages distributed data sources and edge-cloud computing infrastructure to overcome data privacy concerns and enhance accuracy and efficiency for EV energy modeling. The findings provide recommendations for implementing FL-based methods for BEV energy prediction in various real-world systems.
