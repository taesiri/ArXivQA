# [ZeRO: Memory Optimizations Toward Training Trillion Parameter Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to enable efficient training of extremely large deep learning models with hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters using current generation hardware. The key hypothesis is that by optimizing memory usage and removing redundancies, it is possible to scale model sizes much further on existing hardware compared to current approaches.

Specifically, the paper proposes a new system called ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer) that removes redundancies in model states like parameters, gradients, and optimizer statistics across data parallel processes. This allows much larger models to be trained without running out of memory. The paper analyzes the memory consumption and communication overhead tradeoffs of ZeRO compared to standard data parallelism and model parallelism approaches. It hypothesizes that ZeRO can enable training models orders of magnitude larger than current state-of-the-art on existing hardware, while retaining high efficiency.

The central research question is whether optimizations like ZeRO can push the boundaries on how large of a model can be efficiently trained on current hardware. The paper aims to demonstrate that with the right optimizations, we can effectively train models with hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters on today's GPU clusters, which was previously thought to be infeasible.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we overcome the limitations of data and model parallelism to efficiently train extremely large deep learning models with trillions of parameters on today's hardware?

The key limitations identified with existing data and model parallelism approaches are:

- Data parallelism replicates model states (parameters, gradients, optimizer states) across devices, wasting memory. It cannot efficiently train models beyond ~1.5 billion parameters.

- Model parallelism partitions model states across devices to save memory, but results in fine-grained communication and computation that does not scale well, especially across nodes. Existing systems like Megatron-LM top out at ~20 billion parameters.

To address these limitations, the paper proposes Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), which has two main components:

- ZeRO-DP: Partitions model states across data parallel processes instead of replicating, while retaining the coarse-grained communication of data parallelism for efficiency. This enables training models with trillions of parameters using data parallelism alone.

- ZeRO-R: Reduces activation memory overhead, optimizes temporary buffers, and defeats memory fragmentation to further improve memory efficiency. 

The central hypothesis is that ZeRO can overcome the limitations of existing data and model parallelism to efficiently train models with trillions of parameters on today's hardware by optimizing memory usage while retaining high computational efficiency. The results demonstrate training a 100 billion parameter model at over 15 petaflops on 400 GPUs, significantly outperforming prior art.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a novel solution called Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) to optimize memory usage and boost training speed of very large deep learning models. The key ideas are:

- ZeRO-DP eliminates redundancy in data parallel training by partitioning optimizer states, gradients, and model parameters across GPUs instead of replicating. This reduces memory usage while retaining the efficiency of data parallelism. 

- ZeRO-R further optimizes residual memory for activations, buffers, and fragmentation.

- Together, ZeRO enables training models that are significantly larger (e.g. 100B parameters) on today's GPU clusters compared to current systems like Megatron-LM.

- The paper shows ZeRO can train models over 170B parameters, which is over 8x larger than prior art. It achieves 10x higher throughput and super-linear scaling up to 400 GPUs.

- ZeRO also simplifies large model training by removing the need for complex model parallelism in many cases.

- The techniques enable the training of Turing-NLG, the world's largest language model with 17B parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is developing and demonstrating ZeRO, a set of optimizations that advance the state-of-the-art in large model training by enabling much bigger model sizes, faster training speed, improved scalability and usability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a novel system called Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) for efficient large-scale deep learning training. The key ideas are:

- ZeRO-DP (Data Parallelism): Removes redundancy in model states (parameters, gradients, optimizer states) across data parallel processes to reduce per-device memory. This allows training models with billions of parameters using just data parallelism, without needing model parallelism.

- ZeRO-R (Residual memory): Optimizes activation memory, temporary buffers, and memory fragmentation to reduce the "residual" memory overhead beyond model states.

- Combines benefits of data and model parallelism: Achieves memory efficiency of model parallelism and compute/communication efficiency of data parallelism.

- Enables training models >100x larger than state-of-the-art on same hardware. Trains up to 170B parameter models efficiently on 400 GPUs vs 20B with prior work.

- Achieves 10x higher throughput and super-linear scalability for large models.

- Simplifies large model training by removing need for model parallelism in many cases.

In summary, ZeRO provides a suite of optimizations that enable unprecedented scales and performance for large model training on existing hardware. The techniques demonstrate the ability to train models with over a trillion parameters, which was previously infeasible.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper introduces Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), a set of optimizations to reduce memory footprint and enable efficient training of extremely large deep learning models up to trillions of parameters. Here are some key points on how it compares to other related work:

- Compared to standard data parallelism, ZeRO provides much better memory efficiency by partitioning model states like gradients and parameters instead of replicating across devices. This allows ZeRO to scale to arbitrary large model sizes as long as there are enough devices. Data parallelism alone hits a memory limit around 1.5B parameters.

- Compared to model parallelism frameworks like Megatron, ZeRO achieves equally good or better memory efficiency without the scaling limitations of model parallelism. Megatron scales well within a multi-GPU server but efficiency degrades quickly beyond one server due to lower inter-node communication bandwidth. ZeRO does not have this problem.

- For activation memory, ZeRO introduces optimizations like partitioned activation checkpointing to remove replication compared to model parallelism approaches. Other work like activation recomputation/checkpointing can reduce activation memory but ZeRO is complementary and goes further. 

- For temporary buffers, ZeRO uses constant size buffers unlike approaches where buffer size scales with model size. For memory fragmentation, ZeRO uses novel defragmentation strategies.

- Overall, ZeRO provides a comprehensive system of memory optimizations that work together to push the envelope on model scale, achieving over 8x bigger models and 10x higher throughput than state-of-the-art like Megatron.

In summary, ZeRO provides fundamental innovations in memory efficiency for distributed training that outperform existing data and model parallelism approaches. The results enable unprecedented model sizes not possible before with standard hardware.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on training large deep learning models:

- The main contribution of this paper is the ZeRO (Zero Redundancy Optimizer) system, which optimizes memory usage to enable training models with over 100 billion parameters. This significantly advances the state-of-the-art, as prior works like Megatron-LM have topped out at around 10-20 billion parameters.

- ZeRO takes a hybrid approach combining insights from data parallelism (good scaling efficiency) and model parallelism (good memory efficiency). Most prior works focus on one or the other. ZeRO aims to get the best of both worlds.

- Compared to model parallelism methods like mesh-tensorflow and Megatron-LM, ZeRO does not require changes to the model architecture itself. This makes ZeRO more accessible to researchers without distributed training expertise.

- Unlike some other approaches that offload parameters to CPU memory, ZeRO keeps everything on GPUs to avoid slow CPU-GPU transfers. It focuses on optimizing GPU memory usage.

- ZeRO demonstrates strong scalability up to 400 GPUs on a distributed cluster. Prior model parallelism techniques like Megatron-LM show good intra-node scalability but degrade sharply past one node.

- The techniques in ZeRO like partitioned optimizer states and gradients are novel and complementary to prior work on checkpointing activations or quantization/compression.

- ZeRO enables new state-of-the-art results, including a 17 billion parameter Turing-NLG model, demonstrating its real-world impact.

In summary, ZeRO pushes the envelope on extremely large model training by creatively combining insights from data and model parallelism and engineering an efficient distributed memory optimization system. The results significantly advance research in this domain.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of training extremely large deep learning models with trillions of parameters on current hardware. The key question is how to fit and train such massive models given limited device memory.

The current solutions of data parallelism and model parallelism have limitations in memory efficiency and scaling efficiency, respectively. Data parallelism replicates all model states across devices, wasting memory. Model parallelism partitions states across devices for memory efficiency but results in too fine-grained computation and communication that does not scale well. 

The paper proposes Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) to optimize memory usage while retaining high efficiency. ZeRO-powered data parallelism removes redundancy in model states like gradients and optimizer states while minimizing communication overhead. This enables linear memory reduction with data parallelism degree while maintaining near ideal scaling efficiency. Combined with model parallelism, ZeRO can fit models with trillions of parameters on today's hardware.

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of extremely large model training by optimizing memory usage through ZeRO while retaining computational and communication efficiency. The key innovations are in removing redundancy across data parallel processes and retaining efficiency through careful communication scheduling.
