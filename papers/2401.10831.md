# [Understanding Video Transformers via Universal Concept Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10831)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Understanding Video Transformers via Universal Concept Discovery":

Problem:
- Understanding the hidden representations within neural networks is important for issues like accountability, safety, and innovative model design. 
- For images, much research has analyzed CNN and transformer representations, revealing how they process information from low-level cues to high-level concepts across layers. 
- However, little is known about the inner workings of video transformers, which have extra complexity from the temporal dimension. What spatiotemporal mechanisms do they use? Are any mechanisms universal across models trained on different tasks?

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper introduces the first concept-based interpretability algorithm for video transformers, called Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD).
- VTCD segments a video transformer's intermediate features into spatiotemporal "tubelets" using SLIC clustering. The tubelets act as proposals that are clustered across videos into human-interpretable concepts.
- A new noise-robust concept ranking method called CRIS is proposed to quantify each concept's importance to the model's predictions.
- VTCD concepts and importance scores are mined across models to find "Rosetta" concepts that represent universal information.

Main Contributions:
- VTCD enables interpretability of video transformers via open-world spatiotemporal concept discovery, validated quantitatively and qualitatively.
- Analysis reveals common mechanisms like early layers encoding positional information while later layers form object representations - even in self-supervised models. 
- Some concepts are universally shared between diverse models, suggesting intrinsic ways video transformers represent videos.
- Pruning unimportant VTCD concepts can enhance efficiency and performance of fine-grained video transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the first algorithm for unsupervised discovery and ranking of human-interpretable spatiotemporal concepts within video transformer models, enabling an analysis of their decision-making and revealing universal representations across tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing the first concept discovery and explanation methodology specifically tailored for video transformers. In particular:

1) The paper introduces the Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm for decomposing video transformer representations into human-interpretable concepts without using any labels. This includes efficient approaches for generating spatiotemporal tubelet proposals and clustering them into concepts.

2) The paper proposes a new method called Concept Randomized Importance Sampling (CRIS) to quantify the importance of concepts in transformer models. This method is designed to handle redundancy across attention heads.

3) The paper analyzes concepts discovered by VTCD across several video transformers trained on different datasets and tasks. It identifies shared, "Rosetta" concepts that emerge universally irrespective of the training procedure. 

4) The paper shows how VTCD can be used to prune unimportant attention heads from video transformers, improving efficiency and performance when targeting specific classes.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the first methodology for concept-based interpretability of video transformers and using it to gain new insights into their inner workings and representations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes generating spatio-temporal tubelet proposals via SLIC clustering in the model's feature space. What are the key advantages of this approach over using superpixels or random crops in the input space? How does clustering in feature space help alignment with the model's representations?

2. The paper adapts Convex Non-negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) for concept clustering since regular NMF cannot handle negative values that arise from GeLU activations. What modification does CNMF make to enable handling negative values? How does this constrain the factorization?  

3. The paper proposes a new concept ranking method called CRIS to handle redundancy and robustness of transformer heads. How does CRIS differ from existing gradient-based or occlusion-based concept ranking methods? Why do those methods fail for transformers?

4. The discovered concepts reveal that the TCOW model solves occlusion reasoning by first identifying possible distractors in mid layers before tracking the target in later layers. What does this suggest about the model's approach to disambiguation? How might we have designed the model differently based on this insight?

5. For the SSv2 action recognition task, the paper shows the model learns to identify containers before dropping events occur. What does this reveal about the fine-grained spatiotemporal reasoning process? How surprising is it that this emerges in a self-supervised model?

6. The paper introduces the idea of mining for Rosetta concepts shared between models. What similarity metric is used to match concepts between models? How is the computational complexity handled when matching between many models?

7. What universal computational patterns and representations does the paper discover via Rosetta concept analysis? How do these vary across model layers and between supervised vs. self-supervised models? 

8. The paper shows improved efficiency and accuracy by pruning heads using VTCD. What underlying assumption enables this? How does the number of heads pruned allow controlling tradeoffs between accuracy and efficiency?

9. Could the VTCD approach be applied to models beyond video transformers? What components would need to be adapted to handle different architectures? What new challenges might emerge?

10. The paper focuses on analyzing model keys rather than queries and values. What justification is provided for this choice? How might analyzing queries and values provide complementary insights in future work?
