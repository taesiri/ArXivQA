# [FlightLLM: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with a Complete   Mapping Flow on FPGAs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 suffer from heavy computation and memory overheads due to their explosive growth in model size. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, requiring 660 TOPS for a single inference.
- Model compression techniques like sparsification and quantization can reduce these overheads but GPUs and existing accelerators cannot efficiently process the resulting irregular sparsity patterns and mixed precisions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes FlightLLM, a complete mapping flow to enable efficient LLM inference on FPGAs. 
- It utilizes FPGA-specific resources like DSPs and heterogeneous memory to address the challenges of low computation efficiency, underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads when mapping compressed LLMs to FPGAs.

Key Contributions:
- Configurable sparse DSP chain to support different sparsity patterns with 1.6x higher computation efficiency
- Always-on-chip decode scheme with mixed precision support to boost memory bandwidth from 35.6% to 65.9% 
- Length adaptive compilation to reduce instruction storage from TBs to GBs, enabling deployment of real-world LLM models

Evaluated on the LLaMA2-7B model on a Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA, FlightLLM achieves 6.0x higher energy efficiency and 1.8x better cost efficiency compared to a NVIDIA V100S GPU. It also demonstrates 1.2x higher throughput than a NVIDIA A100 GPU when evaluated on a Xilinx Versal VHK158 FPGA.

In summary, the paper innovatively tackles the challenges of mapping compressed LLMs to FPGAs through customized sparse compute and memory access schemes, enabling significant improvements in efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FlightLLM, an efficient FPGA-based inference accelerator for large language models that utilizes configurable sparse DSP chains, an always-on-chip decode scheme, and a length adaptive compilation method to address the challenges of low computation efficiency, underutilized memory bandwidth, and large compilation overheads.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a configurable sparse DSP chain to support different sparsity patterns and improve computation efficiency by 1.6x with block-wise and N:M sparsity.
