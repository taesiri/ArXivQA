7. Expanding applications: Applying AutoML techniques to new domains like robotics, drug discovery, particle physics where complex pipelines are used but automation is lacking.

In summary, the key future directions are: better integration of AutoML components, meta-learning, multi-fidelity optimization, data-efficient learning, interpretability, theory development, and expanding applications. The overall goal is to develop more powerful, practical and scalable end-to-end AutoML systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper "A Comprehensive Survey of Automated Machine Learning":

The paper provides a comprehensive review of the field of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), which aims to automate the end-to-end process of applying machine learning. The authors define AutoML as a composition of four key problems: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter optimization (CASH), which selects and configures pipelines of data processing, feature engineering, and modeling algorithms; Neural Architecture Search (NAS), which automates neural network design; Meta-learning, which leverages experience with past tasks to accelerate learning on new tasks; and Automated Machine Learning Systems, which integrate these capabilities into end-to-end systems. The review covers the motivation, history, taxonomy, methods, applications, benchmarks, and open challenges for each of these four AutoML subfields. Overall, the authors argue that while AutoML has made significant progress, the field is still nascent and substantial research is required to achieve the overarching goal of fully automated machine learning with minimal human input.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in two paragraphs:

The paper proposes a new neural architecture search method called NASNet. The key idea is to design a search space where architectures are constructed by stacking together building blocks called "cells". The cells themselves are small neural networks, represented as directed acyclic graphs, whose connections and operations are optimized by a controller using reinforcement learning. After finding high-performing cells on a small dataset like CIFAR-10, the authors demonstrate that transferring these cells to construct larger networks for ImageNet leads to excellent results. 

Specifically, the controller uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to explore the search space. It is trained to predict two types of cells - normal and reduction - which are alternated when stacked together into the full architecture. Once good cell designs are found, constructing NASNet simply involves selecting the number of cells to use. On CIFAR-10, a NASNet achieves 3.3% error with 3.1 million parameters, while the largest NASNet achieves over 82% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, comparable to state-of-the-art hand-designed models but using 43% fewer parameters. The key contributions are a novel hierarchical search space and one of the first demonstrations that transferring cells from small to large datasets is an effective strategy.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper "Neural Architecture Search: A Survey":

The paper provides a comprehensive survey of neural architecture search (NAS) methods, which aim to automate the design of neural network architectures. The key components of NAS that the paper focuses on are the search space, search strategy, and performance estimation strategy. For search space, the paper reviews common spaces like NASNet-style hierarchical spaces, MobileNet-style spaces, and unrestricted spaces. For search strategy, it covers evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, gradient-based methods, and more. To evaluate candidate architectures during the search, the paper discusses strategies like training from scratch, weight-sharing among candidates, and predictive modeling of performance. Overall, the survey gives a broad overview of the core elements of modern NAS techniques, analyzing the trade-offs between search spaces, strategies, and performance estimation approaches.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper "Automated Deep Learning: Think Outside NAS and HPO" provides a comprehensive review of the field of automated deep learning (AutoDL). The key problems/questions it is addressing include:

1. AutoDL has been dominated by a focus on neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO). However, there is much more to AutoDL than just these two subfields. The paper provides a broader perspective on AutoDL research across the entire deep learning workflow.

2. Existing AutoDL surveys tend to take a narrow technical dive into one or two sub-areas like NAS and HPO. This paper aims to bridge connections between the different AutoDL subfields and assess the overall landscape. 

3. With the rapid growth of research in AutoDL, there is a need for more rigorous assessment criteria beyond just model accuracy. The paper proposes 10 criteria (novelty, accuracy, efficiency, etc.) to critically evaluate AutoDL work.

4. The end goal of AutoDL is full automation of the DL workflow. However, most current research still requires substantial human effort and design choices. The paper discusses obstacles and opportunities towards closing this gap.

5. AutoDL inherits much from the broader field of AutoML but also has unique challenges like model complexity. The paper aims to distinguish AutoDL progress relative to AutoML.

In summary, the key focus is providing a more holistic perspective on AutoDL research and identifying where the field currently stands and where opportunities for progress exist in terms of automation, benchmarking, integration, and moving beyond a narrow accuracy-driven perspective. The paper serves both as a review resource and a commentary on improving AutoDL practices.
