# [Grounding Foundation Models through Federated Transfer Learning: A   General Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17431)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a federated transfer learning framework for grounding foundation models (FTL-FM). It formulates three objectives for FTL-FM: (1) transfer the knowledge of a server's foundation model to optimize clients' domain models, (2) leverage clients' domain knowledge to enhance the server's foundation model, and (3) co-optimize both the server's and clients' models. Based on this, a detailed taxonomy is constructed to categorize FTL-FM works according to the knowledge transfer approach, information protected, and protection mechanism. The paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods based on this taxonomy, analyzing their techniques and relationships to the FTL-FM formulations. It also overviews critical efficiency and privacy preservation methods for FTL-FM. Open challenges are discussed, including improving utility, privacy, efficiency and robustness of FTL-FM, addressing model ownership issues, and managing tradeoffs between conflicting objectives like privacy and utility. Promising future directions are highlighted such as continual learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, integrating machine unlearning for privacy, and extending FTL-FM to edge AI systems. Overall, this paper makes significant contributions towards establishing a systematic framework, taxonomy and overview of the emerging FTL-FM field.

 This paper proposes an FTL-FM framework that formulates problems of grounding foundation models through federated transfer learning, constructs a taxonomy to categorize FTL-FM works, systematically reviews state-of-the-art methods, overviews efficiency and privacy techniques, and discusses opportunities and future directions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper include:

1) Proposing an FTL-FM framework that formulates three settings of grounding foundation models through federated transfer learning. 

2) Constructing a taxonomy to categorize state-of-the-art FTL-FM works based on the FTL-FM framework and specific research issues.

3) Systematically reviewing FTL-FM works using the proposed taxonomy, analyzing their technical details, and discussing their relationships with the FTL-FM framework formulations.

4) Providing an overview of efficiency-improving and privacy-preserving methods that are important for FTL-FM.

5) Discussing open opportunities and future research directions for FTL-FM based on a comprehensive investigation of existing works.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an FTL-FM framework to formulate the problem of grounding foundation models via federated transfer learning, along with a taxonomy to categorize and systematically review relevant works. The discussions on efficiency, privacy, and future directions also provide useful insights into this emerging research field.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an FTL-FM framework with three key objectives (settings). Could you elaborate on the differences and relationships between these three objectives? What are some potential scenarios or use cases suited for each objective?

2. The taxonomy categorizes FTL-FM works along several key dimensions like knowledge transfer approaches and protection methods. What are the pros and cons of different knowledge transfer approaches in adapting foundation models to downstream tasks? When would you choose one over the other? 

3. The paper discusses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods as a way to efficiently adapt large foundation models. Could you compare and contrast different PEFT techniques like adapter tuning, prompt tuning and LoRA? What factors influence the choice between them?

4. The paper reviews progressive, adaptive and emergent-ability based knowledge transfer. How do these advanced transfer methods differ from traditional knowledge distillation? What makes them better suited for transferring knowledge from large foundation models?

5. Differential privacy (DP) is commonly used for privacy protection in FTL-FM. What are some limitations of DP, especially when applied to complex language tasks? What other privacy protection methods could complement or improve upon DP?

6. What kinds of attacks are most concerning in FTL-FM systems - privacy attacks, backdoor attacks or something else? What makes FTL-FM potentially more vulnerable than conventional federated learning? 

7. The paper discusses opportunities like continual learning and machine unlearning for FTL-FM. How could these capabilities be useful when adapting and updating ever-evolving foundation models over time?

8. What are some unique efficiency and scalability challenges involved in deploying giant language models on resouce-constrained edge devices? How can federated learning and transfer learning help address these?

9. What innovative federated learning protocols or algorithms could enable seamless cloud-edge collaboration for online adaptation of foundation models? What factors need to be considered?

10. How can we design optimization objectives and constraints in FTL-FM systems to achieve optimal tradeoffs between critical factors like privacy, utility, efficiency and fairness?
