# [Stochastic Conditional Diffusion Models for Semantic Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16506)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing diffusion models for semantic image synthesis struggle to generate high-quality images, especially for small or rare object classes. The semantic information for these classes tends to get lost early in the diffusion process.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new discrete diffusion process called Label Diffusion with two key components:
   - Label Masking: Gradually masks semantic labels and converts them to an absorbing 'masked' state over the diffusion timesteps. Ultimately all labels become 'masked'.
   - Class-Wise Noise Scheduling: Masks labels for smaller/rarer classes slower over time compared to larger/more common classes. This retains semantic information for longer for the challenging classes.

- Noise schedule defined based on two terms:
   - ψc: Captures relative size of class c objects (smaller -> slower masking)  
   - φc: Captures relative rarity of class c in dataset (rarer -> slower masking)

- Scheduling generalizes linear/uniform schedule (when η→0) and no masking (when η→∞). Allows control over diffusion speed per class.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes Label Diffusion, a new discrete semantic diffusion process with label masking and class-wise noise scheduling.
- Demonstrates class-wise scheduling is more effective at retaining semantics, especially for small or rare classes.
- Provides formal analysis of noise schedule properties.
- Overall, enhances quality of semantically-consistent image synthesis compared to prior diffusion models.
