## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of a retention mechanism for sequence modeling in the RetNet architecture. Can you explain in detail how this retention mechanism allows for training parallelism while still enabling cost-effective inference? 

2. The paper discusses extending the retention mechanism to two dimensions for image processing. Can you walk through the mathematical formulation that enables bidirectional retention for images based on the Manhattan distance between token pairs?

3. The paper mentions combining causal masking and exponential decay in the retention matrix D. What is the motivation behind using exponential decay over other decay functions, and how does it interact with the causal masking?

4. When extending retention to 2D, the paper uses a Softmax normalization on the attention weights. What is the reasoning behind using Softmax versus other normalization approaches? How does this impact the model's attention distribution?

5. The paper explores using RetNet as the basis for Vision Transformers. In detail, how is the retention mechanism adapted to handle 2D image inputs in the Vision Transformer architecture? 

6. What modifications need to be made to the queries, keys, and values in the RetNet formulation when extending it from 1D sequences to 2D images? How do these changes align the retention mechanism with visual data?

7. The paper discusses both recurrent and parallel forms of the RetNet architecture. In what scenarios would one format be preferential over the other, and why does enabling both formats improve overall performance?

8. How do the inductive biases introduced with the RetNet architecture compare to those in the original Transformer? What unique advantages does RetNet offer in your view?

9. The paper proposes RetNet as a potential successor to Transformers for large language models. Do you see areas where RetNet would still struggle compared to Transformers? Why or why not?

10. What open questions remain regarding the optimal configurations and hyperparameter settings when applying RetNet architectures to language or vision tasks? What guidelines does the paper give?
