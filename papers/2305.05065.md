# [Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05065)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can a new single-stage generative retrieval paradigm for recommender systems outperform the traditional two-stage retrieve-then-rank approaches?2. Can representing items with semantically meaningful identifiers ("Semantic IDs") improve recommender system performance compared to using random atomic IDs?3. What new capabilities, like cold-start recommendations and diverse recommendations, emerge from using this new generative retrieval approach with Semantic IDs?The key ideas and components proposed to address these questions are:- Representing items with Semantic IDs, which are tuples of discrete codewords that capture semantic similarity between items. These are generated by quantizing content embeddings of items using an autoencoder called RQ-VAE.- Framing the sequential recommendation task as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, where the model is trained to autoregressively generate the Semantic ID of the next item given a sequence of previous item IDs. This allows retrieving candidates in one shot without needing an additional retrieval step.- Showing experimentally that this new Generative Retrieval approach called TIGER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sequential recommendation benchmarks.- Demonstrating new capabilities like being able to recommend new/cold-start items better by generating their Semantic IDs directly and tuning the diversity of recommendations by sampling Semantic ID tokens at different levels of the hierarchy.In summary, the core hypotheses are around whether this new generative retrieval paradigm along with semantically meaningful item representations can improve over traditional recommender systems. The paper presents TIGER as a way to test these hypotheses.
