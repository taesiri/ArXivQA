# [Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05065)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Can a new single-stage generative retrieval paradigm for recommender systems outperform the traditional two-stage retrieve-then-rank approaches?2. Can representing items with semantically meaningful identifiers ("Semantic IDs") improve recommender system performance compared to using random atomic IDs?3. What new capabilities, like cold-start recommendations and diverse recommendations, emerge from using this new generative retrieval approach with Semantic IDs?The key ideas and components proposed to address these questions are:- Representing items with Semantic IDs, which are tuples of discrete codewords that capture semantic similarity between items. These are generated by quantizing content embeddings of items using an autoencoder called RQ-VAE.- Framing the sequential recommendation task as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, where the model is trained to autoregressively generate the Semantic ID of the next item given a sequence of previous item IDs. This allows retrieving candidates in one shot without needing an additional retrieval step.- Showing experimentally that this new Generative Retrieval approach called TIGER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on sequential recommendation benchmarks.- Demonstrating new capabilities like being able to recommend new/cold-start items better by generating their Semantic IDs directly and tuning the diversity of recommendations by sampling Semantic ID tokens at different levels of the hierarchy.In summary, the core hypotheses are around whether this new generative retrieval paradigm along with semantically meaningful item representations can improve over traditional recommender systems. The paper presents TIGER as a way to test these hypotheses.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on recommender systems with generative retrieval compares to other research in the field:- It proposes a new paradigm of using a single-stage generative retrieval model rather than the traditional two-stage retrieve-then-rank approach. Most prior work uses dual-encoder models for retrieval followed by ranking.- It introduces the idea of representing items with Semantic IDs - tuples of codes generated from item content features like text. This is different from typical approaches that assign random atomic IDs. Using Semantic IDs allows sharing parameters for semantically similar items.- The paper shows state-of-the-art performance on sequential recommendation using the proposed TIGER model on several real-world datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the generative retrieval approach.- A key benefit highlighted is the ability to handle cold-start recommendations for new items. Since Semantic IDs are derived from content, they can be assigned to unseen items. This alleviates cold-start issues faced by methods relying on past interaction data.- The generative nature allows controlling diversity of recommendations by manipulating temperature. This is difficult for typical nearest-neighbor retrieval models.- The paper focuses on sequential/session-based recommendation while much prior work tackles general product recommendation. The techniques may also extend to non-sequential scenarios.- It uses a Transformer architecture for the sequence-to-sequence model unlike RNN/CNN models predominant in sequential recommenders. The Transformer memory acts as a soft index.Overall, this paper introduces a novel formulation of recommendation as generative sequence prediction using Semantic IDs. The results demonstrate improved accuracy and capabilities like handling cold-start. The ideas open up new research directions at the intersection of generative modeling and recommender systems.
