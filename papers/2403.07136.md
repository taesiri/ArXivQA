# [On the Limited Representational Power of Value Functions and its Links   to Statistical (In)Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07136)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Policy evaluation is a core problem in reinforcement learning. Model-free (value-based) methods like LSTD are computationally cheaper but sometimes statistically inefficient compared to model-based methods.
- Through analysis of several case studies, the paper finds puzzling evidence on efficiency of LSTD - efficient in some cases, very inefficient in other minor variations.

Proposed Explanation:  
- The root cause is that some problem structures cannot be encoded in value functions. This leads to an "information loss" when using value-based methods.
- Formally, information loss happens when a class of models $\mathbb{M}$ maps to the same value functions as a larger class of models $\mathfrak{M}$. Then value functions alone cannot exploit structure of $\mathbb{M}$.

Analysis and Contributions:
- In depth analysis of linear dynamical systems, including decoupled, diagonal and LQR variants. 
- Shows perfect correlation between information loss in value function space and statistical inefficiency of LSTD.
- Provides formal results linking LSTD to model-based methods on overly large model classes in cases with information loss.
- Concludes issue is not with LSTD but limitations of value-based representations. Problem specific structure needs to be incorporated into algorithms.

In summary, the paper offers a novel perspective on limitations of value-based RL methods by formalizing the concept of information loss. Through analysis of important problem classes, it makes a compelling case that information loss leads to statistical inefficiency of algorithms like LSTD. The insights help explain puzzling behavior of LSTD and point to directions for improving model-free algorithms.
