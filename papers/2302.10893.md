# [Fair Diffusion: Instructing Text-to-Image Generation Models on Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is how to instruct text-to-image generative models like Stable Diffusion to generate fairer and less biased outputs. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Generative text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion exhibit biases inherited from their training data and/or learned representations.2) It is possible to mitigate these biases and steer the models towards fairer outcomes by providing additional human instructions during inference/deployment. 3) A technique called "Fair Diffusion" can be used to provide textual instructions to the model to increase fairness and impartiality in the generated outputs.Specifically, the paper investigates gender and racial biases in occupations generated by Stable Diffusion. It hypothesizes that providing additional textual guidance to promote diversity (e.g. +female, +African American) during image generation can mitigate biases in the model's outputs. The central research questions revolve around identifying biases, developing effective instruction methods, and evaluating their ability to reduce biases and unfairness compared to the default model.In summary, the key hypothesis is that generative AI models exhibit biases, but providing targeted human instructions during inference can help address these issues and increase fairness in the models' outputs. The paper aims to demonstrate and evaluate this approach through empirical experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel strategy called "Fair Diffusion" to mitigate biases in text-to-image diffusion models after they have been deployed. Specifically, the authors:- Audit the publicly available Stable Diffusion model and its components (training data, text encoder, generated images) for gender occupation biases. They find evidence of biases in all components.- Propose Fair Diffusion, which allows instructing the model to reduce bias in its image generation outcomes by providing additional textual guidance. This gives users control over the model's fairness after deployment, without needing to modify the model's training process or data.- Evaluate Fair Diffusion empirically and show it can effectively shift the gender proportion of generated images towards any desired distribution, increasing fairness. For example, they generate more gender-balanced sets of images depicting various occupations.- Discuss opportunities and limitations of Fair Diffusion and post-deployment debiasing techniques. They argue it allows implementing different notions of fairness and can help promote fairness in society by controlling media depictions. But biases remain in the model components.In summary, the key innovation is Fair Diffusion, a strategy to mitigate unfair biases in diffusion models after deployment by exploiting their textual interface, giving users control over fairness. This is contrasted with typical debiasing techniques applied during training.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research on bias mitigation in generative AI models:- This paper focuses on evaluating and mitigating gender and racial biases specifically in text-to-image diffusion models, whereas much prior work has looked at biases in generative language models. Diffusion models for image generation are a relatively new but rapidly advancing technology, so this provides a timely analysis.- The authors take a novel approach of instructing the model to mitigate bias at deployment time, rather than techniques like data filtering or modifying the training process. This allows flexibility in implementing different definitions of fairness dynamically rather than being constrained by how the model was trained.- They analyze multiple components of a popular diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) including the training data, encoder, and generated outputs for biases. Many prior audits have focused only on individual model components. Evaluating the full pipeline provides insights into how biases propagate and interact between different stages.- To mitigate biases, they introduce "Fair Diffusion", which leverages the textual interface of diffusion models to provide additional guidance that steers generation towards fairer outcomes as defined by the user. This interactive approach allows user control over model fairness compared to automated debiasing techniques.- The proposed strategy is evaluated empirically on a large dataset of occupation images for gender biases. Most prior work has been theoretical or evaluated more narrowly. The scale of this analysis demonstrates Fair Diffusion's ability to shift output demographics in any user-specified direction.- They surface limitations around binary gender classification and the subjective nature of fairness definitions. Many papers present debiasing solutions without critically discussing their assumptions and restrictions. The discourse in this work around dual use, non-binary gender, and varied fairness ideals is an important contribution.In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive, empirical analysis of biases in a leading generative AI model paired with a novel, flexible user-driven mitigation technique applicable at deployment. The scale of the experiments and critical discussion around fairness make meaningful advances over related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Further disentangling the components of diffusion models (the training data, learned representations, and model outcomes) to better understand the sources of bias and how they interact. The authors found biases in all components but it is still unclear exactly how they originate and propagate. More analysis on this could help improve debiasing techniques.- Comparing different generative diffusion models in terms of fairness. The authors focused their analysis on Stable Diffusion but suggest it would be interesting to evaluate other models as well. This could reveal differences in how biases manifest across models.- Extending the analysis to image-to-image diffusion models, instead of just text-to-image. The authors propose applying their fairness strategy to models that can edit real-world images, not just generated ones.- Exploring non-textual interfaces for fair guidance, such as visual or multimodal instructions. The authors suggest their strategy could support encodings beyond just natural language text.- Further research into encoding gender as non-binary in generative models, instead of relying on binary gender classification tools. The authors acknowledge current limitations in representing gender diversity.- Developing mechanisms to automatically detect biases and unfairness, instead of relying solely on human intervention. The authors envision fair guidance could be automated if biased concepts are identified beforehand.- Considering the potential dangers of human interaction, such as adversarial attacks. The authors recognize risks if users have malicious intentions and suggest further detection mechanisms are needed.In summary, the authors point to several interesting directions for better understanding, measuring and mitigating biases in generative diffusion models. Both technical advances and consideration of the societal impacts seem important for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper introduces a novel strategy called Fair Diffusion to mitigate biases in text-to-image generative models like Stable Diffusion (SD). The authors first audit SD and its components (training data, CLIP encoder, generated images) for gender occupation biases. They find evidence of biases in all components, though the biases are not simply mirrored between training data and generated images. To address these biases, they propose Fair Diffusion, which provides textual instructions at inference time to guide the model towards fairer outputs according to the user's notion of fairness. Specifically, Fair Diffusion uses simultaneous positive and negative guidance to suppress biased concepts and promote fairer concepts in the generated images. Experiments on mitigating gender occupation stereotypes show that Fair Diffusion can successfully shift the gender distribution of generated occupational images towards a more balanced and fair outcome. The authors argue that instructing models at deployment is a practical way to increase fairness that gives control to the user. They also discuss limitations and societal impacts. Overall, this work demonstrates a novel strategy to mitigate unfairness in text-to-image models after deployment.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a method called Fair Diffusion for mitigating biases in diffusion models, which are a type of generative text-to-image model. The authors first evaluate the sources of bias in the components of the publicly available Stable Diffusion model, including its training dataset LAION-5B, the CLIP encoder used to embed text, and the generated images. They find evidence of gender and racial biases related to occupations in all components. To address these biases, they propose Fair Diffusion, which provides textual instructions to the model during inference to steer the image generation towards fairness. For example, the model can be guided to generate more images of female firefighters by providing edits like "-male firefighter" and "+female firefighter". Experiments demonstrate that Fair Diffusion can effectively shift the proportion of generated images for different identities like gender and race to match user-specified distributions. In summary, this work makes several contributions: (i) inspecting sources of bias in Stable Diffusion components; (ii) proposing Fair Diffusion, a novel strategy for instructing the model to mitigate bias by editing the image generation process based on textual guidance from the user; and (iii) empirically demonstrating that Fair Diffusion enables controlling the diversity and fairness of image generation. The authors highlight opportunities to use interactive systems like Fair Diffusion to align AI systems with user notions of fairness at deployment time.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The main method used in the paper is called Fair Diffusion, which is a strategy for mitigating biases in text-to-image generative models like Stable Diffusion. The key idea is to instruct the model on fairness after it has already been trained and deployed, without needing to modify the training data or re-train the model. Specifically, Fair Diffusion works by providing additional textual guidance to the model at inference time to steer the image generation towards fairer outcomes. For example, if generating images of "firefighters", the model can be guided with concepts like +“female” and -“male” to make the output more gender balanced. The user can control the strength and direction of these concepts to shift the bias towards their desired notion of fairness.Under the hood, Fair Diffusion builds on an existing image editing technique called Semantic Guidance that allows modifying diffusion models via textual concepts. By extending this with explicitly fair concepts, the initially unconditioned image generation becomes conditioned not just on the input text prompt but also additional user instructions for fairness. In this way, Fair Diffusion offers a practical approach to edit biases in a model after deployment and gives control to the user over the fairness of outcomes.
