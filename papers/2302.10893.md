# [Fair Diffusion: Instructing Text-to-Image Generation Models on Fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10893)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is how to instruct text-to-image generative models like Stable Diffusion to generate fairer and less biased outputs. The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Generative text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion exhibit biases inherited from their training data and/or learned representations.2) It is possible to mitigate these biases and steer the models towards fairer outcomes by providing additional human instructions during inference/deployment. 3) A technique called "Fair Diffusion" can be used to provide textual instructions to the model to increase fairness and impartiality in the generated outputs.Specifically, the paper investigates gender and racial biases in occupations generated by Stable Diffusion. It hypothesizes that providing additional textual guidance to promote diversity (e.g. +female, +African American) during image generation can mitigate biases in the model's outputs. The central research questions revolve around identifying biases, developing effective instruction methods, and evaluating their ability to reduce biases and unfairness compared to the default model.In summary, the key hypothesis is that generative AI models exhibit biases, but providing targeted human instructions during inference can help address these issues and increase fairness in the models' outputs. The paper aims to demonstrate and evaluate this approach through empirical experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel strategy called "Fair Diffusion" to mitigate biases in text-to-image diffusion models after they have been deployed. Specifically, the authors:- Audit the publicly available Stable Diffusion model and its components (training data, text encoder, generated images) for gender occupation biases. They find evidence of biases in all components.- Propose Fair Diffusion, which allows instructing the model to reduce bias in its image generation outcomes by providing additional textual guidance. This gives users control over the model's fairness after deployment, without needing to modify the model's training process or data.- Evaluate Fair Diffusion empirically and show it can effectively shift the gender proportion of generated images towards any desired distribution, increasing fairness. For example, they generate more gender-balanced sets of images depicting various occupations.- Discuss opportunities and limitations of Fair Diffusion and post-deployment debiasing techniques. They argue it allows implementing different notions of fairness and can help promote fairness in society by controlling media depictions. But biases remain in the model components.In summary, the key innovation is Fair Diffusion, a strategy to mitigate unfair biases in diffusion models after deployment by exploiting their textual interface, giving users control over fairness. This is contrasted with typical debiasing techniques applied during training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel strategy called Fair Diffusion to mitigate biases in text-to-image diffusion models by providing textual instructions that steer the model's generations towards fairer and more impartial outcomes, requiring no additional training or data filtering.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research on bias mitigation in generative AI models:- This paper focuses on evaluating and mitigating gender and racial biases specifically in text-to-image diffusion models, whereas much prior work has looked at biases in generative language models. Diffusion models for image generation are a relatively new but rapidly advancing technology, so this provides a timely analysis.- The authors take a novel approach of instructing the model to mitigate bias at deployment time, rather than techniques like data filtering or modifying the training process. This allows flexibility in implementing different definitions of fairness dynamically rather than being constrained by how the model was trained.- They analyze multiple components of a popular diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) including the training data, encoder, and generated outputs for biases. Many prior audits have focused only on individual model components. Evaluating the full pipeline provides insights into how biases propagate and interact between different stages.- To mitigate biases, they introduce "Fair Diffusion", which leverages the textual interface of diffusion models to provide additional guidance that steers generation towards fairer outcomes as defined by the user. This interactive approach allows user control over model fairness compared to automated debiasing techniques.- The proposed strategy is evaluated empirically on a large dataset of occupation images for gender biases. Most prior work has been theoretical or evaluated more narrowly. The scale of this analysis demonstrates Fair Diffusion's ability to shift output demographics in any user-specified direction.- They surface limitations around binary gender classification and the subjective nature of fairness definitions. Many papers present debiasing solutions without critically discussing their assumptions and restrictions. The discourse in this work around dual use, non-binary gender, and varied fairness ideals is an important contribution.In summary, this paper provides a comprehensive, empirical analysis of biases in a leading generative AI model paired with a novel, flexible user-driven mitigation technique applicable at deployment. The scale of the experiments and critical discussion around fairness make meaningful advances over related work.
