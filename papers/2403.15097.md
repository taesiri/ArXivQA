# [Argument-Aware Approach To Event Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15097)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Event linking connects event mentions in text to relevant knowledge base (KB) nodes. It is useful for applications like QA systems.
- Prior event linking work overlooks distinct event features and struggles with out-of-KB cases. Events have complex structures and can be better distinguished by examining arguments like time, location, participants. 
- Event KBs are limited, needing models to identify out-of-KB event mentions. This is overlooked in prior work.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce an argument-aware approach to improve event linking and handle out-of-KB cases
- First, augment input text with tagged event argument roles (e.g. time, location, participants) to help models recognize key event details  
- Generate synthetic out-of-KB training examples by manipulating event arguments of in-KB instances. This equips models to predict both KB and out-of-KB instances.
- Apply approach on existing retrieve-and-rerank architecture, adding a learned "NIL" class for out-of-KB prediction.

Contributions:
- Show event arguments improve linking performance 
- Propose method to create synthetic out-of-KB training data by altering event arguments 
- Demonstrate significant gains on both in-KB (+1%) and out-of-KB (+22%) test sets
- Analysis verifies argument tagging and synthetic data enhance model robustness

In summary, the paper introduces event argument-aware techniques to enhance event linking models, especially for out-of-KB generalization via controlled synthetic data creation.
