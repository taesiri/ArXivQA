# [Neural Link Prediction with Walk Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04375v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis appears to be that current graph neural network (GNN) based link prediction methods do not adequately leverage higher-order topological information from the graph structure. The key points are:- Link prediction is a highly topological task, so topology plays a more important role than in node classification.- However, current state-of-the-art GNN methods like SEAL encode topological information only indirectly through techniques like node labeling. This limits their ability to capture important higher-order patterns like network motifs. - The paper proposes a new pooling method called WalkPool that directly extracts higher-order topological features by encoding node representations into random walk transition probabilities.- WalkPool allows jointly learning topology-sensitive features rather than relying on hardcoded heuristics. It generalizes methods like counting short cycles.- Experiments show WalkPool achieves state-of-the-art performance on link prediction benchmarks, including on heterophilic graphs where topology-based heuristics normally fail.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that directly extracting higher-order topological features through techniques like WalkPool will improve link prediction performance compared to current GNN methods that only indirectly encode topology.
