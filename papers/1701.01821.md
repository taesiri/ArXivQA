# [Unsupervised Learning of Long-Term Motion Dynamics for Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01821)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is how to learn an effective video representation in an unsupervised manner that captures long-term motion dynamics and is useful for activity recognition. Specifically, the paper proposes an unsupervised learning framework to encode long-term motion dependencies in videos by learning to predict sequences of basic 3D motions over time. The key ideas are:- Describe motion as a sequence of "atomic" 3D flows by quantizing estimated dense 3D flows over time. This provides a compact and easy to model representation of motion. - Use an LSTM encoder-decoder model to predict sequences of these atomic 3D flows given a pair of input frames. The encoder has to learn a robust video representation with long-term motion dependencies in order to accurately reconstruct the flow sequences.- Evaluate the learned video representations on activity recognition tasks across multiple modalities (RGB, depth, RGB-D) and datasets without fine-tuning. Show state-of-the-art performance compared to other unsupervised video representation learning techniques.In summary, the main hypothesis is that learning to predict atomic 3D flow sequences in an unsupervised manner will encourage representations that capture useful long-term motion patterns for activity recognition. The results support this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
