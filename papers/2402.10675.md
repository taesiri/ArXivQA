# [German Text Simplification: Finetuning Large Language Models with   Semi-Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10675)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text simplification can help make information accessible for many groups including people with disabilities, but manually simplifying texts is time-consuming. 
- There is limited availability of German parallel text simplification data to train machine learning models.

Proposed Solution:
- A semi-synthetic dataset is created to address the data scarcity problem for German text simplification. 
- Simplified German texts are crawled from various sources like news websites.
- GPT-4 is used to generate synthetic everyday language versions to pair with the simplifications.
- Large Language Models are finetuned on this semi-synthetic parallel dataset.

Models:
- Different language models were evaluated including GPT-2 and Leo LM. 
- Different decoding algorithms were analyzed like greedy, beam search, sampling, and contrastive search. 
- Larger models with more parameters (up to 13B) achieved higher scores on automatic metrics like BLEU, METEOR, and SARI. 
- Rule-based metrics had some limitations in evaluating document-level simplification.

Contributions:
- The first semi-synthetic data approach for German text simplification addressing the data scarcity issue.
- Largest dataset for German document-level text simplification across multiple domains. 
- Evaluation showed language models effectively simplified real-world web content and retained content.
- Models and dataset are publicly released as a resource for the research community.

Limitations and Future Work:
- More targeted evaluation focusing on specific target user needs could be beneficial.
- Exploring methods to better fit the various styles of language simplification like easy language rules.

In summary, this pioneering study created a large semi-synthetic German language simplification dataset to tackle data scarcity, and effectively trained models that simplified and retained content from real-world websites. The public release of resources is a contribution for advancing further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a semi-synthetic dataset for German text simplification created by crawling existing simplifications and using GPT-4 to generate corresponding everyday language texts, then trains and evaluates Large Language Models on this data, demonstrating their ability to significantly simplify real-world online content while retaining meaning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Creating a corpus of parallel text simplification data in German based on a novel methodology of using synthetic data. Specifically, the authors crawled professionally simplified German texts and then used GPT-4 to generate corresponding "everyday language" texts to create input-simplified text pairs.

2) Training, evaluating, and releasing Large Language Model (LLM)-based language simplification models for German texts. The authors fine-tuned LLMs with up to 13 billion parameters on their semi-synthetic dataset and evaluated the models' ability to simplify real-world online texts.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing a new semi-synthetic data approach to address the data scarcity problem in German text simplification and leveraging this data to train effective LLM-based simplification models for German and release them publicly. The paper demonstrates the viability of synthetic data for training performant simplification models.

The paper introduces a semi-synthetic dataset for German text simplification created by crawling professionally simplified texts and using GPT-4 to generate corresponding texts in everyday language. This dataset is used to finetune and evaluate large language models for text simplification. The models are assessed using both automatic metrics like BLEU, METEOR and SARI as well as manual evaluation of content similarity. Different decoding algorithms like greedy search, beam search, sampling and contrastive search are analyzed. The limitations of current evaluation metrics are also discussed. Overall, the key focus is on using semi-synthetic data and LLMs to advance German text simplification.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel semi-synthetic approach for generating parallel text simplification data. Can you explain in detail the process used for creating synthetic source texts paired with real simplified texts? What role does GPT-4 play?

2. The paper trains Large Language Models (LLMs) on the semi-synthetic dataset. Can you describe the different LLMs explored, including their architectures and key parameters? What motivated the selection of these specific models? 

3. The paper compares four different decoding algorithms for generating simplified texts - greedy, beam search, sampling-based and contrastive search. Can you explain how each of these algorithms works and what their relative strengths and weaknesses are in the context of text simplification?

4. The paper analyzes the linguistic complexity of the synthetic texts compared to real web content and simplified texts across three domains - sports, celebrities and news. What metrics were used in this analysis? What were the key findings? What do the results indicate about the quality of the synthetic data?

5. The paper points out limitations of rule-based evaluation metrics like BLEU, METEOR and SARI for assessing quality in document-level text simplification. Can you explain these limitations in detail, giving relevant examples from the paper? How could the metrics be improved?

6. The decoding algorithms are configured with certain parameters, like number of beams, penalty alpha etc. What is the significance of these parameters? How were they tuned in this work? What effect do they have on the generated simplifications?

7. The paper evaluates the models on real-world online content from three German websites. What metrics were used to assess language complexity and content similarity? What do these results indicate about the practical applicability of models trained on semi-synthetic data?

8. The paper released the dataset and models publicly to enable further research. What are some ways the resources could be extended or improved in future work? What other models or training schemes could be explored?

9. The conclusion indicates that finetuning the models to adhere to specific simplification styles could be an interesting area for future work. Can you suggest some techniques to achieve this? What data resources would be needed?

10. The paper is limited to German text simplification. How could the overall approach be adapted to other languages with scarce parallel simplification data? What language-specific challenges might arise?
