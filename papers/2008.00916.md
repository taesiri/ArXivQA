# [Explainable Face Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we quantitatively evaluate and benchmark different approaches for explainable face recognition (XFR)?

The key points are:

- XFR aims to explain why a face matching system matches two face images, by identifying discriminative regions that are more similar between the matched pair compared to non-matched images. 

- Evaluating and comparing XFR methods is challenging due to the lack of ground truth for facial regions that contribute to matching decisions.

- The paper proposes a new quantitative evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" to benchmark different XFR algorithms. This involves synthetically generating inpainted face images where a facial region like the nose or eyes is modified. 

- The inpainting game measures how well an XFR method can identify the inpainted region as being discriminative for matching the original identity over the modified identity.

- Using this protocol, the paper provides a benchmark for 5 XFR methods on 3 face matchers, and shows that their proposed methods (DISE and Subtree EBP) outperform prior state-of-the-art.

In summary, the key research contribution is the inpainting game protocol for standardized quantitative evaluation and benchmarking of explainable face recognition algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Providing the first comprehensive benchmark and baseline evaluation for explainable face recognition (XFR). The paper defines a new evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" to quantitatively test XFR algorithms. 

2. Introducing a new inpainting dataset with synthesized triplets of face images to use with the inpainting game protocol. The dataset provides localized ground truth for evaluating saliency maps.

3. Evaluating five XFR algorithms, including two newly proposed methods (subtree EBP and DISE), as baselines on the inpainting game using three different face matchers. The new methods outperform prior state-of-the-art approaches.

4. Providing the first standardized benchmark results and analysis to compare XFR algorithms. This aims to encourage more research in explainable AI for face recognition.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be formally defining the XFR problem, proposing an evaluation methodology and dataset for it, benchmarking some algorithms, and promoting further research in this area. The paper provides the first comprehensive framework for quantitatively evaluating and comparing approaches for explaining face recognition systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on explainable face recognition (XFR):

- The paper provides the first comprehensive benchmark and evaluation protocol (the "inpainting game") for quantitatively evaluating XFR methods. Prior work has focused more on qualitative visualization studies. The inpainting game allows objective comparison of different XFR algorithms.

- The paper introduces two new XFR algorithms - subtree EBP and DISE - which outperform prior methods like excitation backprop (EBP) and contrastive/truncated contrastive EBP. This advances the state-of-the-art in the field.

- The study evaluates XFR methods on multiple face matchers (LightCNN, VGGFace2, ResNet-101), providing insights into how explanation methods vary across different networks. Prior work has mostly focused on a single network.

- The inpainting dataset provides controlled variation in facial identity to generate ground truth for evaluation. This is more systematic than using unmodified face images where ground truth is unclear.

- The scope is limited to white-box explanation methods that assume access to the face matcher's internal representations. Some prior work has explored black-box explanation methods as well.

- The focus is on explaining pairwise face matching rather than identification/retrieval among a large gallery. The explanations aim to highlight differences between similar faces.

- The work is limited to static images, whereas video face recognition is also an active area of research.

Overall, this paper makes significant contributions over prior work by introducing a principled quantitative evaluation framework, new state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluation on multiple networks, and a new inpainting dataset. This sets a strong baseline for future research on explainable face recognition.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing new XFR algorithms to further improve upon the performance of DISE and subtree EBP on the inpainting game benchmark. The authors see their work as establishing a new baseline, and hope to encourage further research in XFR using their quantitative evaluation protocol.

- Exploring different forms of explanation beyond saliency maps, such as synthesizing linguistic explanations for face matching decisions. The authors note that saliency maps are just one possible approach for XFR.

- Training new convolutional networks with interpretability and explainability in mind. For example, incorporating loss functions that encourage part separability, so the networks are more amenable to explanation.

- Exploring the cross-demographic failures and biases of face matching systems using XFR. The authors suggest XFR could enable auditing for issues like gender or ethnicity bias.

- Applying XFR to study different face matching algorithms, beyond the neural networks focused on in this paper. Using XFR to compare how commercial and academic systems represent and match faces.

- Leveraging XFR to increase trust and transparency for users of face recognition systems. The authors see this as a promising application for XFR research.

- Using ideas like XFR to provide explanations for other biometrics beyond faces, such as fingerprints or iris recognition systems.

In summary, the authors see their inpainting benchmark as a starting point, and outline many interesting directions to build on top of their initial XFR framework and results. Their quantitative evaluation methodology helps enable further progress in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark and baseline evaluation for explainable face recognition (XFR). The authors define a new evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" which uses triplets of images (probe, mate, nonmate) where the nonmate is synthesized by inpainting a facial region like the nose or eyebrows. This creates a doppelganger that differs only in the inpainted region. XFR algorithms are tasked with generating a saliency map that highlights probe regions that match the mate and not the nonmate, providing ground truth regions for evaluation. The authors provide a benchmark of five XFR algorithms on their new inpainting dataset and three facial matchers. They introduce two new top performing algorithms called subtree EBP and DISE that significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art methods. This work provides an important benchmark and evaluation protocol to drive further research in explainable face recognition.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces the first comprehensive benchmark and baseline evaluation for Explainable Face Recognition (XFR). The authors define a new evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" which uses triplets of images (probe, mate, nonmate) where the nonmate image is synthesized by inpainting a facial region like the nose or eyebrows to make it a different identity. The XFR algorithm must generate a saliency map highlighting which regions of the probe image match the mate image and differ from the nonmate. This provides ground truth for evaluating what image regions contribute to face matching. 

The authors provide a benchmark comparing five XFR algorithms on the inpainting dataset using three facial matchers. The benchmark includes two new algorithms: subtree EBP and Density-based Input Sampling for Explanation (DISE). Results show these new methods significantly outperform current state-of-the-art XFR algorithms. The inpainting game protocol and dataset allow objective comparison of XFR systems. Overall this work provides a new quantitative benchmark for research on explainable AI for face recognition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" for benchmarking and comparing different explainable face recognition (XFR) algorithms. The inpainting game uses triplets of images consisting of a probe image, a mate image, and a synthesized "nonmate" image where a facial region like the nose or mouth has been inpainted to alter the identity. The XFR algorithm must generate a saliency map highlighting the regions of the probe image that are most discriminative for matching the mate versus nonmate identity. The inpainted nonmate provides ground truth for evaluating the saliency map, since the algorithm should highlight the inpainted region. The paper benchmarks five XFR algorithms, including two new methods called subtree EBP and DISE, on this inpainting dataset using three different facial matchers. The inpainting game enables quantitative comparison and benchmarking of XFR methods using localized ground truth.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key problem this paper is addressing is how to explain why a facial recognition system matches two faces. Specifically:

- The paper notes that deep convolutional networks for facial recognition are traditionally considered "black box" systems, where it is not clear what features or regions of the face image the network uses to match faces. 

- The goal is to develop explainable face recognition (XFR) systems that can visualize and highlight the regions of a face image that are most important for matching that face to a particular identity. 

- This explanation can help build trust and transparency in facial recognition systems, and provide insight into the learned representations.

- A key challenge is generating ground truth data and evaluation protocols to quantitatively compare different approaches to XFR. The paper introduces a new "inpainting game" protocol for this purpose.

So in summary, the main problem is developing techniques to explain facial recognition matches, in order to open up the black box of these systems. The paper provides new methods, datasets and protocols to establish benchmarks for this nascent field of explainable face recognition (XFR).
