# Explainable Face Recognition

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we quantitatively evaluate and benchmark different approaches for explainable face recognition (XFR)?The key points are:- XFR aims to explain why a face matching system matches two face images, by identifying discriminative regions that are more similar between the matched pair compared to non-matched images. - Evaluating and comparing XFR methods is challenging due to the lack of ground truth for facial regions that contribute to matching decisions.- The paper proposes a new quantitative evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" to benchmark different XFR algorithms. This involves synthetically generating inpainted face images where a facial region like the nose or eyes is modified. - The inpainting game measures how well an XFR method can identify the inpainted region as being discriminative for matching the original identity over the modified identity.- Using this protocol, the paper provides a benchmark for 5 XFR methods on 3 face matchers, and shows that their proposed methods (DISE and Subtree EBP) outperform prior state-of-the-art.In summary, the key research contribution is the inpainting game protocol for standardized quantitative evaluation and benchmarking of explainable face recognition algorithms.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Providing the first comprehensive benchmark and baseline evaluation for explainable face recognition (XFR). The paper defines a new evaluation protocol called the "inpainting game" to quantitatively test XFR algorithms. 2. Introducing a new inpainting dataset with synthesized triplets of face images to use with the inpainting game protocol. The dataset provides localized ground truth for evaluating saliency maps.3. Evaluating five XFR algorithms, including two newly proposed methods (subtree EBP and DISE), as baselines on the inpainting game using three different face matchers. The new methods outperform prior state-of-the-art approaches.4. Providing the first standardized benchmark results and analysis to compare XFR algorithms. This aims to encourage more research in explainable AI for face recognition.In summary, the main contribution appears to be formally defining the XFR problem, proposing an evaluation methodology and dataset for it, benchmarking some algorithms, and promoting further research in this area. The paper provides the first comprehensive framework for quantitatively evaluating and comparing approaches for explaining face recognition systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research on explainable face recognition (XFR):- The paper provides the first comprehensive benchmark and evaluation protocol (the "inpainting game") for quantitatively evaluating XFR methods. Prior work has focused more on qualitative visualization studies. The inpainting game allows objective comparison of different XFR algorithms.- The paper introduces two new XFR algorithms - subtree EBP and DISE - which outperform prior methods like excitation backprop (EBP) and contrastive/truncated contrastive EBP. This advances the state-of-the-art in the field.- The study evaluates XFR methods on multiple face matchers (LightCNN, VGGFace2, ResNet-101), providing insights into how explanation methods vary across different networks. Prior work has mostly focused on a single network.- The inpainting dataset provides controlled variation in facial identity to generate ground truth for evaluation. This is more systematic than using unmodified face images where ground truth is unclear.- The scope is limited to white-box explanation methods that assume access to the face matcher's internal representations. Some prior work has explored black-box explanation methods as well.- The focus is on explaining pairwise face matching rather than identification/retrieval among a large gallery. The explanations aim to highlight differences between similar faces.- The work is limited to static images, whereas video face recognition is also an active area of research.Overall, this paper makes significant contributions over prior work by introducing a principled quantitative evaluation framework, new state-of-the-art algorithms, evaluation on multiple networks, and a new inpainting dataset. This sets a strong baseline for future research on explainable face recognition.
