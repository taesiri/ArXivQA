# [This Looks Like That, Because ... Explaining Prototypes for   Interpretable Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02863)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can visual prototypes learned by neural networks for image recognition be explained automatically to improve their interpretability and simulatability?The authors argue that just visualizing prototypes is insufficient for understanding what they represent and why they are considered similar to a given image by the model. They propose a method to quantify the importance of different visual characteristics (hue, shape, texture, etc.) for each prototype. This generates textual explanations to clarify the meaning of prototypes and reveal the model's reasoning process. The goal is to make prototype-based models like ProtoPNet more interpretable and improve simulatability, which is the ability of a human to reproduce the model's predictions based on the explanations. The authors test their approach on ProtoPNet prototypes and evaluate whether the explanations correspond to visual properties and help explain potentially misleading or ambiguous prototypes.So in summary, the main research contribution is an automated methodology to generate explanations that quantify the importance of visual characteristics for prototypes in order to improve the interpretability and simulatability of prototype-based models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method to automatically enhance visual prototypes with textual explanations about important visual characteristics. Specifically, the authors:- Propose automatically quantifying the influence of color hue, shape, texture, contrast and saturation to explain why a prototype-based image classification model considers two image patches to be similar. - Apply their method to prototypes learned by the ProtoPNet model. The explanations help clarify the meaning of prototypes, especially for cases where similarity is not obvious to a human.- Show that their global explanations, which explain prototypes in general, are robust and correspond to visually identifiable properties. The explanations can reveal if a prototype focuses on different aspects than a human might expect.- Demonstrate that their local explanations, which explain the similarity score for a specific test image, provide added insights compared to just showing prototype activation maps. The local explanations reveal why different test images get high similarity scores with the same prototype.- Analyze redundant prototypes and show that visually similar prototypes not necessarily have similar explanations, indicating that some prototypes complement each other.In summary, the key contribution is a general methodology to make any visual prototype-based classification model more interpretable by quantitatively explaining prototypes with respect to important visual characteristics. The automated approach disentangles localization and explanation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper: The paper presents a method to improve the interpretability of prototype-based image classification models by automatically generating explanations that quantify the influence of visual characteristics like color, texture, and shape on the model's similarity assessments between prototypes and images.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some key points about how this paper compares to other related research:- It focuses specifically on improving the interpretability of prototype-based image classification models. This is a relatively new but growing area of research as prototype models have emerged as intuitively interpretable alternatives to deep neural networks.- The paper introduces a novel method to quantitatively explain visual prototypes by evaluating the importance of different image characteristics like color, texture, shape etc. Most prior work has focused only on visualizing or highlighting prototypes, without providing explicit explanations.- The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to any prototype-based classification model. In contrast, many existing interpretability techniques are designed for specific model architectures. The generality of this approach is a notable strength.- The paper demonstrates the approach on ProtoPNet, a recently proposed prototype model. However other prototype models like ProtoTree or prototypical parts could also benefit from this explanation technique.- The experiments focus on evaluating whether the explanations seem reasonable and can detect unintuitive prototypes. Some related works have conducted human studies to more rigorously measure interpretability, but this type of quantitative evaluation is still rare.- For image data, most existing interpretability methods focus on CNNs rather than prototype models. So this paper provides a novel interpretation angle tailored to prototype methods.Overall, a key contribution is the introduction and evaluation of a generalizable approach to provide local and global explanations specifically for prototype models. The results demonstrate the potential for this technique to improve the interpretability of an important emerging class of deep learning models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Analysing potential interactions between visual characteristics in the importance scores. Currently, the scores treat characteristics as independent, but modifying one characteristic (e.g. texture) could slightly affect another (e.g. shape). The authors suggest future analysis to determine the extent of correlation between characteristics.- Extending the approach with additional visual characteristics or image modifications beyond the current hue, saturation, shape, texture and contrast. The modular nature of the method makes it easy to incorporate new transformations.- Applying the explanation approach to other prototype-based models beyond ProtoPNet, such as ProtoTree. The generality of the method makes it suitable for improving interpretability of any similarity-based prototypical image recognition model.- Using the global explanations that quantify prototype redundancy to reduce the number of prototypes. This could help limit explanation size and avoid misleading redundant prototypes.- Evaluating how well the explanations help actual users correctly simulate the model's reasoning. While current analysis focuses on the faithfulness of explanations, human studies could explicitly measure the effect on simulatability.- Adapting the approach to video recognition tasks with spatio-temporal prototypes. The image modifications could be extended to video characteristics like motion.In summary, the main future directions are exploring additional visual characteristics, applying the method to new prototypical models, leveraging the explanations to reduce prototypes, validating effects on users, and extending the approach to video domains. The modular nature of the method provides many possibilities for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a method for explaining visual prototypes learned by prototype-based image recognition models like ProtoPNet. The authors argue that only visualizing prototypes is insufficient for understanding what a prototype represents and why the model considers a prototype similar to an image. They propose automatically enhancing prototypes with textual quantitative explanations about the importance of visual characteristics like color, texture, and shape. Their method modifies characteristics of an image and analyzes how that impacts the prototype-image similarity score from the model. The characteristics that cause a large change in similarity when modified are deemed important by the model. Both global explanations for prototypes and local explanations for test images are generated. The authors apply their method to ProtoPNet and show it can reveal when prototypes focus on different attributes than a human might expect. The explanations improve model interpretability, especially for ambiguous prototypes, by explaining the model's reasoning process.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a method to explain visual prototypes learned by prototype-based image recognition models like Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet). Prototype-based models classify images by comparing patches in the image to learned prototypical patches and assigning a similarity score. However, the meaning of a prototype can be ambiguous to a human if it is just visualized without any explanation. The authors argue prototypes should be explained with respect to the model's reasoning, in order to improve interpretability. Their method automatically modifies characteristics like color, texture, and shape of images, and analyzes how these modifications influence the prototype-image similarity score assigned by the model. In this way, they quantify the importance of visual characteristics for each prototype. This results in textual explanations that reveal what characteristics the model deems important in a prototype. The authors apply their method to ProtoPNet prototypes and generate global explanations that summarize the importance of characteristics for each prototype, as well as local explanations that explain the similarity score between a prototype and a specific test image. Experiments confirm the global explanations generalize well across different datasets. The authors show the explanations are especially useful for 'misleading' prototypes that may be interpreted incorrectly by a human otherwise. By explaining such prototypes, the interpretability and simulatability of the model is improved. The simple and generic nature of their approach means it could extend any prototype-based image recognition model.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper presents a method to improve the interpretability of prototype-based image classification models by automatically enhancing prototypes with textual quantitative explanations about important visual characteristics. The approach involves modifying images by changing characteristics like color hue, texture, shape, contrast and saturation. Both the original and modified images are then passed through the prototype model to analyze the change in similarity scores assigned to prototypes. The difference in scores indicates the importance of that characteristic for a particular prototype. These importance scores are used to generate textual explanations that quantify the influence of visual properties for each prototype. Both global explanations that summarize a prototype's general strategy as well as local explanations for individual images are produced. This explanatory approach is designed to be model-agnostic and is demonstrated on the Prototypical Part Network, clarifying its prototype similarities which may not match human perception.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the issue of ambiguity and lack of explainability of visual prototypes learned by prototype-based image classification models like ProtoPNet. The key points are:- Prototype-based image classification relies on measuring the visual similarity between learned prototype images/patches and patches in a test image. The classification depends on how much a test image "looks like" a prototype.- However, perceptual similarity for humans can be different from the similarity learned by the classification model. Just visualizing prototypes is insufficient for a human to understand what a prototype exactly represents, and why the model considers a prototype and image patch to be similar.- Prototypes can be ambiguous and potentially misleading if the model's reasoning does not match human intuition. This hurts the interpretability and simulatability of the model.- The paper proposes a method to automatically enhance prototypes with textual explanations that quantify the influence of color, shape, texture and other visual characteristics that are important for the model's similarity assessment. - This helps clarify the meaning of prototypes, especially misleading ones, and improves the interpretability and simulatability of prototype-based image classification models.In summary, the key problem is the ambiguity and lack of explainability of visual prototypes, which the paper aims to address by automatically generating textual explanations of the prototypes.
