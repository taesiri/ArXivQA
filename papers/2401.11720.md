## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Graph Condensation: A Survey":

Problem: 
With the exponential growth in graph data across various domains, managing and processing large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. A key issue is the substantial computational demands of training graph neural networks (GNNs) on such large graphs, which hinders the feasibility of graph-based applications. To mitigate this problem, graph condensation (GC) has emerged as an effective graph reduction approach. GC focuses on synthesizing a small yet highly informative graph that can serve as a surrogate for the original large graph in training GNNs. However, GC is still an evolving field grappling with challenges including generalization, fairness, efficiency, and evaluation. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper provides a systematic taxonomy and review of GC methods. It categorizes GC techniques into four groups: effective GC, generalized GC, fair GC and efficient GC, based on key evaluation criteria - effectiveness, generalization, fairness and efficiency. The paper explores two fundamental GC components: (1) Optimization strategies like gradient matching, trajectory matching, kernel ridge regression and distribution matching; (2) Condensed graph generation methods for constructing node attributes and graph structure. It also discusses diverse applications of GC and highlights current challenges and future directions.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a taxonomy to categorize GC methods based on motivation and evaluation criteria, structuring knowledge and capturing underlying objectives driving research
- Provides a comprehensive review of latest GC advancements and an in-depth analysis of fundamental GC techniques 
- Discusses practical applications of GC and summarizes state-of-the-art from perspectives spanning effectiveness, generalization, fairness and efficiency
- Identifies current limitations of GC and suggests promising future directions, including GC for complex graphs, task-agnostic condensation, evaluation metrics and explainability

Overall, this paper offers researchers and practitioners an extensive understanding of the GC landscape, guiding future progress in this critical area of graph-based machine learning.
