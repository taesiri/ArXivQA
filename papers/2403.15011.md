# [Cell Tracking according to Biological Needs -- Strong Mitosis-aware   Random-finite Sets Tracker with Aleatoric Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Cell tracking algorithms achieve near perfect accuracy on technical benchmarks, however still lack long-term consistency required by biologists to analyze entire cell life cycles. This is because leading tracking-by-regression methods like EmbedTrack only consider local cues between frames, while biological metrics rely on preserving consistency across long sequences.

Solution:
This paper introduces two main contributions - 

1) Uncertainty estimation for tracking-by-regression: Leverages test time augmentation with shifted images to identify uncertain motion predictions. This relaxes the discrete output to probability densities indicating the likelihood of different motion hypotheses.

2) Mitosis-aware PMBM tracker: Incorporates the uncertainty-aware output to sample multiple association hypotheses over long sequences. It explicitly models expected cell lifetimes to penalize biologically unlikely mitosis events, helping resolve long-term tracking conflicts.  

Together, these contributions enhance long-term consistency while retaining local accuracy:

- Uncertainty estimation provides cues to identify heuristic matching behavior and areas like occlusions where the tracker may fail.

- The PMBM tracker maintains multiple global hypotheses over time, allowing the rectification of errors using future evidence. Cell lifetimes guide this process to avoid implausible mitosis detections.

Results:
The approach is evaluated on 9 datasets from the cell tracking challenge, showing substantial gains on biological metrics (up to 5.75x) over state-of-the-art like EmbedTrack. Technical metrics are on par with the baseline.

Main Contributions:
- Novel PMBM tracker incorporating uncertainty estimations and biological constraints 
- Mitosis-aware assignment costs based on expected cell lifetimes
- Enhanced long-term consistency and state-of-the-art biological metrics
- Analysis providing insights about uncertainty estimation for neural trackers

The key insight is that while neural trackers achieve strong technical benchmarks, biological applications require long-term consistency even at the cost of occasional local errors. The proposed approach effectively identifies and resolves these errors.
