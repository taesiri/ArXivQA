# [Structure-Aware Path Inference for Neural Finite State Transducers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13614)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural finite-state transducers (NFSTs) are expressive sequence transduction models that incorporate symbolic biases through a finite-state topology. However, training NFSTs requires marginalizing over latent alignment paths, which is intractable.

- Prior work proposed an inference network for NFSTs that generates alignment paths autoregressively using a sequential model, considering past path context and remaining input/output suffixes. 

- This paper explores whether incorporating explicit knowledge of the future possible alignments allowed by the NFST topology into the inference network can improve alignment path sampling.

Methods:
- Three alignment path sampling methods are compared:
   - SWA: Attends to encoded input/output strings
   - SWS: Encodes unaligned input/output suffixes
   - SWP (novel): Treats possible future alignments as a weighted FSM, encodes states/arcs

- All methods are autoregressive, use RNNs or Transformers to represent context. SWP additionally propagates information over possible future alignments graph.

- Train proposal distributions with fixed NFST model to minimize exclusive KL divergence estimated via importance sampling.

Results: 
- Evaluated on transliteration, navigation instructions, and synthetic cipher tasks. Alignment complexity varies.

- For monotonic alignment tasks, SWS performs best, no benefit from modeling future alignments graph. SWP underperforms, perhaps due to complexity.

- For cipher task where alignment knowledge is needed, SWP outperforms others by leveraging FST topology.

Conclusions:
- Explicitly modeling future alignment possibilities allowed by FST topology can help, but only when alignment is complex and non-local.

- For simpler cases, added complexity may hurt. Simpler methods already capture effective heuristics.

- More work needed to improve training of structured models like SWP and assess necessity of topological knowledge.
