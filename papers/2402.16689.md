# [Adaptation of Biomedical and Clinical Pretrained Models to French Long   Documents: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recently introduced French biomedical BERT models like DrBERT are limited to 512 token input lengths, which is insufficient for clinical notes that can contain thousands of words. 
- Long-sequence models can process much longer texts but have not been adapted for French biomedical domain.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce and compare three French biomedical long-sequence models based on Longformer architecture:
   - DrBERT-4096: Convert DrBERT weights to Longformer
   - DrLongformer-FS: Train Longformer from scratch on French biomedical corpus
   - DrLongformer-CP: Continue pretraining English Clinical-Longformer on French biomedical data
- Evaluate on 16 downstream biomedical and clinical tasks involving long sequences.

Key Findings:
- For BERT models, no major differences between training from scratch (DrBERT) vs continual pretraining (CamemBERT-bio)
- For Longformer models, continual pretraining (DrLongformer-CP) works better than converting BERT (DrBERT-4096) or training from scratch (DrLongformer-FS)  
- DrLongformer-CP outperforms most models on 11 of 16 tasks - benefits from English clinical data + French biomedical data
- Longformer models improve performance across most tasks regardless of sequence length 
- BERT models remain most efficient for NER tasks  

Main Contributions:
- First French biomedical models adapted for long sequences
- Analysis of different pretraining strategies for Longformer architecture
- Demonstrate performance gains from continual pretraining English then French models
- Show Longformer models benefit biomedical document classification tasks with long contexts


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper presents a comparative study of strategies for adapting French biomedical language models to longer input sequences using the Longformer architecture, finding that further pretraining an English clinical Longformer model on French biomedical data achieves the best performance on downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The introduction of French pretrained language models based on the Longformer architecture for processing long texts in the biomedical and clinical domains. The authors release three Longformer models adapted for French: DrBERT-4096, DrLongformer-FS, and DrLongformer-CP.

2) A comparative study analyzing different pre-training strategies for adapting the Longformer architecture to French biomedical text. The results show that further pre-training an English clinical Longformer model (Clinical-Longformer) on French biomedical data (DrLongformer-CP) achieves better performance than converting a French biomedical BERT model (DrBERT-4096) or pre-training a French biomedical Longformer from scratch (DrLongformer-FS).

3) Demonstrating that the proposed French biomedical Longformer models improve performance on a majority of downstream biomedical and clinical tasks, regardless of sequence length, compared to French BERT models. However, BERT models remain more efficient for named entity recognition tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating French biomedical Longformer models using different pre-training strategies, and showing they outperform BERT models on most tasks involving long input sequences.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What were the key motivations for adapting pretrained language models to process long sequences in French biomedical and clinical domains? Why is it important to handle long sequences for these domains?

2. What are the main limitations of models like BERT when applied to long clinical notes? How do the different sparse attention mechanisms in models like Longformer address these limitations?

3. What were the different pretraining strategies explored for adapting the Longformer architecture to French - converting DrBERT, pretraining from scratch, and continual pretraining? What were the key findings regarding the effectiveness of each strategy? 

4. Why did continual pretraining of the English Clinical-Longformer model on French biomedical data outperform the other pretraining strategies? What benefits did it provide over the other methods?

5. How exactly was the continual pretraining of the Clinical-Longformer model performed? What French biomedical datasets were used and what were the key optimization details?

6. What downstream tasks were used to evaluate the long-sequence models? Why was it important to select tasks with long input sequences to effectively evaluate the models?

7. How did the performance of BERT and Longformer models differ across tasks like NER, document classification, QA, and semantic textual similarity? What key conclusions can be drawn about the strengths of each model architecture?

8. For document classification tasks, how much performance gain did the Longformer models provide over BERT models? Did they mainly improve on long or short sequences?

9. How was the attention distribution analyzed for sample clinical documents? What key insights did this provide into why Longformer models outperformed on classification tasks?

10. What were the limitations of this study, both in terms of reproducibility and environmental impact? How can future work aim to address some of these limitations?
