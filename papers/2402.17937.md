# [Can an LLM-Powered Socially Assistive Robot Effectively and Safely   Deliver Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? A Study With University Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17937)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
University students face increased mental health challenges like anxiety, depression and suicidality. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment method, but requires daily homework assignments between therapy sessions which students often do not adhere to, limiting treatment efficacy. Methods to improve adherence could significantly improve outcomes.  

Solution:
The authors developed a socially assistive robot (SAR) named Blossom that utilizes an advanced large language model (LLM) to guide users through interactive CBT exercises aimed at reducing anxiety. They compared this robot-guided CBT against an LLM-powered chatbot and traditional CBT worksheets in a 15-day study with 38 university students.

Key Contributions:
- Developed prompt engineering methods to enable an LLM to safely and effectively guide users through CBT exercises on cognitive restructuring and coping strategies.

- Demonstrated through a user study that the SAR-guided CBT resulted in reduced general psychological distress over 15 days, on par with traditional CBT worksheets. The chatbot did not lead to such reductions.  

- Showed that the SAR yielded significant pre- to post-session reductions in anxiety on 6 out of 8 days, outperforming the chatbot (2 days) and worksheets (0 days), indicating better short-term relief.

- Provided insights through qualitative analysis into factors impacting adherence, highlighting the need for support accessibility over solely quantity of sessions.

- Showed promise for embodiment and LLMs to improve accessibility, user experience and outcomes of at-home CBT exercises as supplemental tools for therapists.

In summary, the paper presents a novel socially assistive robot leveraging LLMs that interacts with users to guide CBT exercises. Through a comprehensive user study, the authors demonstrate its potential to enhance adherence and reduce anxiety among university students.
