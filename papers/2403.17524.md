# [Provably Secure Disambiguating Neural Linguistic Steganography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Neural linguistic steganography suffers from the segmentation ambiguity problem which leads to decoding failures when the receiver tries to extract the hidden message from a detokenized stego text. This is due to ambiguous tokenization of words into subword tokens like BPE.
- Existing solutions modify token probabilities which makes them incompatible with provably secure steganography where the token distributions must remain unchanged.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel secure disambiguation method, SyncPool, based on ambiguity pool grouping and synchronous sampling. 
- Ambiguity pools group tokens with prefix relationships before embedding to eliminate uncertainty between ambiguous tokens and avoid information loss.
- A shared cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) selects a token from the ambiguity pool to synchronize sender and receiver.
- Does not change token distributions so can be integrated with provably secure steganography.

Main Contributions:  
- Analysis of segmentation ambiguity problems for provably secure steganography
- First provably secure disambiguating linguistic steganography method  
- Ambiguity pool grouping and synchronous sampling approach to eliminate ambiguity without altering language model distribution
- Theoretical security proofs provided
- Experiments show SyncPool eliminates decoding errors without compromising security or efficiency

In summary, the key innovation is a novel ambiguitiy resolution technique tailored for provably secure steganography that enables practical deployment without compromising security. The method is generically applicable across languages and models that use subword tokenization.
