# [GeT: Generative Target Structure Debiasing for Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10205)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How to generate high-quality pseudo labels for domain adaptation tasks that are robust to biases from both the source domain data and target domain class distribution?The key points are:1. The paper proposes a new method called GeT (Generative Target Structure Debiasing) to generate pseudo labels for domain adaptation that are debiased and discriminative. 2. Existing methods suffer from source domain bias when generating pseudo labels by relying too much on the source data. They also do not properly handle class distribution biases in the target domain.3. GeT consists of two main components to address these issues:- An online target generative classifier based on a Gaussian mixture model that models the intrinsic structure of the target data to avoid source bias and encourage discriminative features. - A structure similarity regularization framework that handles class imbalance in the target domain and avoids overconfident biased predictions.4. The overall approach aims to combine strengths of modeling the target data structure while leveraging knowledge of class similarities from the source domain.In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling the intrinsic target data structure while regularizing for class imbalance can generate improved pseudo labels for domain adaptation that are debiased and discriminative compared to existing approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new target structure regularization approach for domain adaptation (DA) tasks to deal with source data bias and class distribution bias. 2. It introduces an online target generative classifier based on a Gaussian mixture model to induce the target feature distribution into distinctive components weighted by class priors. This helps mitigate source data bias and enhance target class discrimination.3. It proposes a structure similarity regularization using an auxiliary distribution and embedding prototypes to avoid overconfidence and encourage balanced/discriminative pseudo labels. 4. It designs a classification expectation maximization framework to jointly optimize the generative classifier, structure regularization, and network parameters for pseudo label generation.5. It achieves competitive performance on several DA tasks and datasets, outperforming other regularization methods and some DA models with explicit feature alignment. In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new target structure regularization approach involving an online generative classifier and similarity regularization to deal with data/class distribution biases and generate high-quality pseudo labels for various DA settings. The method is shown to be effective across different datasets and DA scenarios.
