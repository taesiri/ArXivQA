# [How to Scale Your EMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13813)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How should the hyperparameters of an exponential moving average (EMA) be scaled when changing the batch size during stochastic optimization?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

The EMA momentum hyperparameter should be scaled exponentially with the batch size in order to preserve training dynamics and model performance across different batch sizes. 

Specifically, the paper proposes an "EMA Scaling Rule" which states that when changing the batch size by a factor of κ, the EMA momentum ρ should be scaled as ρ^κ.

The motivation is that model EMAs are commonly used in machine learning to improve generalization and robustness. However, prior work has not studied how to properly scale the EMA momentum when modifying the batch size, which is important for enabling faster training through increased parallelism. 

The paper aims to derive a principled scaling rule for EMA momentum, both theoretically using stochastic differential equation analysis and empirically across tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and self-supervised learning. The goal is to develop a practical tool to help scale training of EMA-based methods like semi-supervised learning and BYOL.

In summary, the key research question is how to scale EMA momentum with batch size, with the hypothesis that exponential scaling preserves optimization dynamics. The paper aims to validate this both theoretically and empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper appears to be deriving and validating an "EMA Scaling Rule" for how to scale the momentum parameter of an exponential moving average (EMA) when changing the batch size during training. The key points are:

- They theoretically derive a rule that the EMA momentum hyperparameter should be scaled exponentially with the batch size. For example, if doubling the batch size, the new EMA momentum should be the old momentum squared. 

- They validate this rule theoretically using stochastic differential equation analysis for SGD and adaptive methods like Adam. This shows the rule gives training dynamics independent of batch size.

- They empirically demonstrate the EMA Scaling Rule for various uses of EMAs during training: Polyak averaging, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning. In all cases, the rule was critical for matching training dynamics across batch sizes.

- For self-supervised methods like BYOL, they show combining the EMA rule with progressive batch size scaling enables scaling to very large batches (e.g. 24576) without performance loss.

In summary, the main contribution is deriving and validating a simple but important rule for how to scale EMA momentum when changing batch size during training, enabling stable training dynamics across batch sizes. This has implications for enabling large batch training in methods relying on EMAs.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper focuses specifically on deriving and validating a scaling rule for exponential moving average (EMA) momentum in the presence of stochastic gradient-based optimization. Other works have studied optimizer scaling rules more generally (e.g. for SGD and Adam momentum), but do not focus on EMA momentum scaling specifically. 

- The paper provides theoretical justification for the EMA scaling rule by deriving it both through an informal argument and more rigorously using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximations. This level of theoretical analysis is quite extensive compared to some other works that propose heuristic scaling rules.

- The paper validates the EMA scaling rule empirically across a wide range of models, datasets, and training regimes - including supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning. Many papers focus validation on just one domain. 

- For self-supervised learning, the paper shows how the EMA scaling rule enables scaling popular methods like BYOL and DINO to very large batch sizes (e.g. 24k+). Other works have struggled to scale these methods effectively.

- The paper proposes techniques like progressive scaling to deal with cases where scaling rules break down at very large batch sizes. This is a practical contribution compared to purely theoretical works.

- Overall, the paper provides one of the most extensive analyses and empirical validations of an optimizer scaling rule that I've seen. The combination of theory and practice makes a nice contribution compared to works that focus on just one aspect. The specific focus on EMA momentum scaling also carves out a useful niche.

In summary, the paper offers a fairly comprehensive treatment of EMA momentum scaling, with rigorous theory and extensive experiments across domains. It moves beyond just proposing a heuristic rule. The practical techniques and large-scale validation also help advance research on scaling popular self-supervised methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following future research directions:

- Investigating the scaling behavior and dynamics of EMA methods beyond SGD, such as adaptive methods like Adam. The authors derived SDE approximations for RMSProp and Adam with EMA, but did not formally prove closeness to the discrete iterations. Rigorously analyzing the scaling properties for adaptive methods would be an interesting direction.

- Studying the effect of EMA methods on optimization landscapes and minima. The authors provide some intuition that EMA helps models settle in flatter minima, but a more thorough theoretical and empirical analysis could reveal more insights. 

- Analyzing the perturbations and instabilities that can occur when transitioning batch sizes in methods like BYOL and DINO. The paper observes these effects but does not deeply investigate their causes. Better understanding these phenomena could lead to more stable scaling procedures.

- Extending progressive scaling ideas to schedule other hyperparameters like weight decay or dropout/regularization rates. The paper focuses on batch size and momentum, but dynamically adjusting other hyperparameters during training may also help preserve dynamics.

- Applying EMA scaling rules and progressive scaling to other self-supervised methods beyond BYOL and DINO. Seeing if these techniques successfully scale methods like SimCLR or Barlow Twins would demonstrate greater generality.

- Developing better theoretical understanding of when and why scaling rules fail at large batch sizes. The paper acknowledges limits to scaling rules, so characterizing their breakdown could guide development of more robust procedures.

- Exploring whether the insights around EMA scaling rules could apply in areas like reinforcement learning where EMA is also widely used. Testing the ideas in new domains would reveal their scope.

Overall, the paper develops solid theory and experiments around scaling EMA methods, but leaves open many avenues for extending this analysis further across optimizers, dynamics, scaling limits, methods, and problem domains.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a scaling rule for the momentum parameter of model Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) when changing the batch size during training. They first informally derive the scaling rule by assuming slowly changing gradients. They then formally prove its validity under more realistic gradient assumptions using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximations of optimization with an EMA. The EMA Scaling Rule states that when increasing the batch size by a factor of κ, the EMA momentum parameter should be raised to the power of κ. This ensures training dynamics are preserved across batch sizes. The authors empirically validate the EMA Scaling Rule in various scenarios where the EMA plays an increasing role in optimization, ranging from Polyak-Ruppert averaging to self-supervised learning. They show that the scaling rule enables matching training trajectories and model performance across batch sizes. The tools provided allow scaling methods like BYOL and DINO to large batch sizes not previously possible. Overall, the work provides a rigorous foundation and recipes for scaling optimization in the presence of model EMAs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces an EMA Scaling Rule for adapting model Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques when changing batch size during optimization. EMAs provide several benefits such as improving model robustness and generalization. While techniques exist for scaling other hyperparameters like the learning rate when changing batch size, a recipe for scaling EMA hyperparameters has been lacking. Through theoretical analysis using stochastic differential equations, the authors derive an EMA Scaling Rule which states that the EMA momentum hyperparameter should be scaled exponentially with the batch size.  

The EMA Scaling Rule is validated through extensive experiments on supervised learning, semi-supervised learning via pseudo-labeling, and self-supervised learning tasks. The experiments cover image classification, speech recognition, and self-supervised representation learning using ResNet and Vision Transformer architectures. Across all experiments, the EMA Scaling Rule enables matching training dynamics and final model quality when changing batch size compared to a baseline. Without properly scaling the EMA momentum, significant divergence from the baseline typically occurs. The work provides a practically useful contribution, enabling robust scaling of EMA-based techniques like BYOL and DINO self-supervised learning.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a scaling rule for the momentum of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) when changing batch size in stochastic gradient optimization. The main method is:

- They first derive an EMA Scaling Rule through intuition and under the assumption of slowly changing gradients. The rule states that when changing batch size from B to k*B, the EMA momentum hyperparameter should be exponentially scaled as rho^k, where rho is the original momentum. 

- They then rigorously validate this rule theoretically using stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximations of optimization with EMA. They prove the EMA Scaling Rule is correct in the SDE limit under realistic gradient noise assumptions.

- Finally, they empirically verify the EMA Scaling Rule across various settings where EMA plays an increasing role: Polyak-Ruppert averaging, semi-supervised learning via pseudo-labeling, and self-supervised learning methods like BYOL. The rule enables matching training dynamics and model performance when scaling batch size in all cases.

Overall, the main contribution is an EMA Scaling Rule validated theoretically and empirically, providing a recipe for adapting optimization with EMAs across batch sizes. This helps scale semi-supervised and self-supervised methods requiring EMAs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an EMA Scaling Rule for modifying the momentum hyperparameter when changing batch size. Can you explain in more detail how this rule was derived theoretically using stochastic differential equations? What assumptions were made?

2. The EMA Scaling Rule states that the momentum should be scaled exponentially with batch size. Intuitively, why is an exponential rather than linear scaling more appropriate? How does this relate to the effect of momentum in the EMA update over time?

3. For the noisy parabola experiments, the paper shows that the EMA Scaling Rule tracks the optimal momentum quite closely until around a scaling factor of 256. What causes the deviation at higher scaling factors? Does this indicate a limitation of the proposed scaling rule?

4. In the image classification experiments, what causes the gap between EMA-scaled and baseline trajectories at high scaling factors like 8 despite using the EMA Scaling Rule? Does this point to issues scaling batch normalization or optimization? 

5. How does the role of the EMA model in semi-supervised speech recognition with pseudo-labeling necessitate use of the EMA Scaling Rule? Why does the optimizer scaling rule breakdown have a bigger impact here?

6. For self-supervised learning with BYOL, what causes the performance gap at scale factor 8 even with the EMA Scaling Rule? How does progressive scaling help mitigate this issue?

7. The paper mentions an impulse perturbation measured at the student when increasing batch size for BYOL. What could be the cause of this phenomenon? How might it relate to the training dynamics of BYOL?

8. In the DINO experiments, why does a sharp batch size transition lead to collapse even with the EMA Scaling Rule? How does progressive scaling help prevent collapse here?

9. Are there any scenarios where the proposed EMA Scaling Rule would be expected to fail or lead to suboptimal results? What are its main limitations?

10. The EMA Scaling Rule relies on the optimizer having its own valid scaling rule. What are some optimizers without known scaling rules where applying this methodology could be problematic?
