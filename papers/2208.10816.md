# Improving Personality Consistency in Conversation by Persona Extending

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How to improve personality consistency in conversational agents/chatbots when responding to queries that fall outside of their predefined personas (referred to as the "out-of-predefined persona" or OOP problem)?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) A retrieval-prediction pipeline involving persona retrieval and selective persona-based response generation can help address the OOP problem and improve personality consistency. 2) Natural language inference can help select retrieved personas that are consistent with predefined personas.3) Modeling the relevance of personas using posterior information from the target response can help improve selection of appropriate personas during response generation.The paper proposes a pipeline consisting of a Persona Retrieval Model (PRM) and a Posterior-scored Transformer (PS-Transformer) to test these hypotheses. The PRM retrieves candidate personas using natural language inference to detect consistency with predefined personas. The PS-Transformer then selectively utilizes the most relevant personas during response generation based on posterior scoring. Experiments on a new IT-ConvAI2 dataset designed to highlight the OOP problem demonstrate improvements in personality consistency compared to baseline methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel framework to address the "out-of-predefined persona" (OOP) problem in dialogue generation. This involves two key processes - conflict-detecting persona retrieving and dialogue generation with selected personas.2. Being the first to leverage natural language inference (NLI) to estimate the coherence between candidate personas and predefined personas during persona retrieval. Experiments show their proposed PRM can gather better personas than other methods. 3. Proposing a novel PS-Transformer model that introduces a Target-Guided Persona Scorer to predict persona distributions instead of simply fusing them. This allows selecting the most suitable persona for response generation. The PS-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results on the IT-ConvAI2 and ConvAI2 datasets.4. Presenting a new challenging dataset called IT-ConvAI2 that highlights the OOP problem in personalized dialogue, to facilitate research in this direction.In summary, the main contributions are proposing a novel pipeline to address the OOP problem in personalized dialogue, using NLI for coherent persona retrieval, introducing persona scoring for selective persona fusion in generation, and releasing a new dataset to spur research on this problem. The proposed methods advance the state-of-the-art in personalized dialogue systems.
