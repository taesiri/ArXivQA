# Improving Personality Consistency in Conversation by Persona Extending

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How to improve personality consistency in conversational agents/chatbots when responding to queries that fall outside of their predefined personas (referred to as the "out-of-predefined persona" or OOP problem)?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) A retrieval-prediction pipeline involving persona retrieval and selective persona-based response generation can help address the OOP problem and improve personality consistency. 2) Natural language inference can help select retrieved personas that are consistent with predefined personas.3) Modeling the relevance of personas using posterior information from the target response can help improve selection of appropriate personas during response generation.The paper proposes a pipeline consisting of a Persona Retrieval Model (PRM) and a Posterior-scored Transformer (PS-Transformer) to test these hypotheses. The PRM retrieves candidate personas using natural language inference to detect consistency with predefined personas. The PS-Transformer then selectively utilizes the most relevant personas during response generation based on posterior scoring. Experiments on a new IT-ConvAI2 dataset designed to highlight the OOP problem demonstrate improvements in personality consistency compared to baseline methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a novel framework to address the "out-of-predefined persona" (OOP) problem in dialogue generation. This involves two key processes - conflict-detecting persona retrieving and dialogue generation with selected personas.2. Being the first to leverage natural language inference (NLI) to estimate the coherence between candidate personas and predefined personas during persona retrieval. Experiments show their proposed PRM can gather better personas than other methods. 3. Proposing a novel PS-Transformer model that introduces a Target-Guided Persona Scorer to predict persona distributions instead of simply fusing them. This allows selecting the most suitable persona for response generation. The PS-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results on the IT-ConvAI2 and ConvAI2 datasets.4. Presenting a new challenging dataset called IT-ConvAI2 that highlights the OOP problem in personalized dialogue, to facilitate research in this direction.In summary, the main contributions are proposing a novel pipeline to address the OOP problem in personalized dialogue, using NLI for coherent persona retrieval, introducing persona scoring for selective persona fusion in generation, and releasing a new dataset to spur research on this problem. The proposed methods advance the state-of-the-art in personalized dialogue systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel retrieval-prediction framework to tackle the out-of-predefined-persona problem in personalized dialogue systems, using natural language inference to retrieve consistent personas and a posterior-scored transformer model to select the most suitable persona for generating each response.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in personalized dialogue systems:- It focuses on tackling the out-of-predefined persona (OOP) problem, where existing approaches fail to generate reasonable responses when queries fall outside predefined personas. This is a novel focus compared to most prior work.- It proposes a two-stage pipeline involving persona retrieval (PRM) and response generation (PS-Transformer). The combination of retrieval and generation to handle OOP queries is a unique approach. - For persona retrieval, it leverages natural language inference (NLI) to select candidate personas that don't conflict with predefined ones. Using NLI for persona retrieval is novel.- For response generation, it introduces a target-guided persona scorer in the PS-Transformer to predict persona relevance distributions instead of fusing personas. Modeling persona distributions is a new technique.- It provides a new challenging dataset IT-ConvAI2 specifically designed to highlight the OOP problem, unlike most existing personalized dialogue datasets.- It achieves improved performance over strong baselines like TransferTransfo and BoB in both automatic and human evaluations. The gains are more substantial on the IT-ConvAI2 dataset.Overall, the focus on OOP queries, the pipeline approach combining retrieval and generation, and the novel techniques like NLI-based retrieval and persona scoring distributions seem to be unique contributions compared to prior personalized dialogue research. The new challenging dataset and the empirical improvements are also differentiating factors.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest include:- Exploring how the extended persona affects the next persona extension in multi-turn conversations. The authors propose a retrieval-to-prediction pipeline for extending personas to handle out-of-predefined persona (OOP) queries in single-turn conversations. They suggest generalizing this approach to multi-turn conversations where the extended persona may influence subsequent persona extensions. - Introducing large-scale commonsense knowledge graphs to infer new personas beyond the predefined global persona set. Currently, their proposed pipeline is limited to handling OOP queries within the global persona set constructed in advance. Leveraging knowledge graphs could allow inferring entirely new personas.- Further research into potential issues like agents fabricating inconsistent personas regarding gender, as noted in their case study. While they focus on extending coherent personas, fabricating inappropriate personas remains a problem to explore.- Incorporating otherposterior information beyond target responses into persona scoring/selection, such as listener feedback or dialog context. Their persona scoring uses target response guidance, but other posterior information could also help determine relevant personas.- Exploring different persona candidate ranking methods beyond their proposed natural language inference approach. There may be other effective ways to rank persona relevance and coherence.In summary, the main directions are generalizing to multi-turn dialogs, using knowledge graphs for broader persona coverage, addressing inconsistent persona fabrication, incorporating additional posterior information, and exploring alternative persona ranking methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel retrieval-to-prediction pipeline to address the out-of-predefined-persona (OOP) problem in personalized dialogue generation. The pipeline consists of two components: 1) A Persona Retrieval Model (PRM) that retrieves a new persona from a global persona collection for an OOP query, using natural language inference to select a persona consistent with predefined personas. 2) A Posterior-scored Transformer (PS-Transformer) that predicts a persona distribution considering the personas' relevance to the context query and actual personas used in the response. The PS-Transformer then generates a response incorporating the most relevant persona. The authors build a challenging Inadequate-Tiny-ConvAI2 dataset containing OOP queries and show their proposed pipeline improves consistency and quality of generated responses on this dataset and ConvAI2. Key ideas are leveraging natural language inference for coherent persona retrieval and modeling persona relevance for selective incorporation during generation.
