# [A Two-stream Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network for Skeleton-based Human   Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00409)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Human interaction recognition (HIR) aims to identify and understand interactive actions between multiple people, such as handshakes, hugging, etc. It is challenging due to the high dimensionality of video data and variability in interactions.  
- Existing methods using CNNs or Transformers alone have limitations in capturing both local specificity and global context. CNNs lack modeling of long-term dependencies while Transformers have high computational complexity and weak local feature learning.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a Two-stream Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network (THCT-Net) that combines CNN and Transformer to exploit their complementary strengths.

- The CNN stream uses a multi-branch framework to learn joint spatio-temporal features from skeleton sequences. It captures local joint features independently and fuses motion features using raw coordinates and temporal differences.

- The Transformer stream integrates 3D convolutions and multi-head self-attention. It models global context and inter-dependencies between interactive entities across space and time.

- The recognition results from the two streams are fused using parallel splicing to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Main Contributions:
- Novel two-stream hybrid architecture combining CNN and Transformer to model local and global context for human interaction recognition.

- New multi-branch CNN stream to automatically learn spatio-temporal joint features from skeleton sequences.

- Transformer stream with 3D convolutions and self-attention to capture global correlations.

- Significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art methods on three challenging datasets - NTU RGB+D, H2O, and Assembly101.

In summary, the paper presents a hybrid CNN-Transformer approach for modeling multi-granularity spatial, temporal and interactive relations to advance human interaction recognition. The two-stream design achieves new state-of-the-art results by effectively fusing local and global contextual information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a Two-stream Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network (THCT-Net) that combines CNN and Transformer models in parallel to exploit CNN's localization specificity and Transformer's global dependency modeling for improved skeleton-based human interaction recognition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new Two-stream Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network (THCT-Net) for human interaction recognition tasks, which uses Transformer self-attention module and traditional convolutional layers to learn multi-granularity context. 

2) Proposing a new multi-branch CNN framework that automatically learns joint spatio-temporal features from skeleton sequences. The framework includes independent learning of local features for each joint, integrating raw skeleton coordinates and temporal differences, and adding residual connections.

3) Conducting extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 120, H2O and Assembly101 datasets that consistently verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming most existing interactive action recognition methods.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing a hybrid CNN-Transformer network architecture that effectively models both local and global context for skeleton-based human interaction recognition and demonstrating superior performance over prior state-of-the-art methods.
