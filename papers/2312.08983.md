# [Interactive Humanoid: Online Full-Body Motion Reaction Synthesis with   Social Affordance Canonicalization and Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08983)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new task called online full-body motion reaction synthesis, where a virtual humanoid character reacts in real-time to the actions and motions of a human actor, optionally in the presence of objects. The authors construct two large-scale datasets - HHI for human-humanoid interaction covering 30 categories, and CoChair for human-object-humanoid interaction with diverse chairs and carrying patterns. They propose a novel social affordance representation that captures the human pose, object state, and their relationship over time. A key contribution is social affordance canonicalization, where they transform the actor motion into each object point's local frame to simplify the distribution. They also introduce social affordance forecasting to help the reactor better anticipate the actor's future moves. The proposed method with these components outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on quantitative metrics and generates more natural and prompt reactions. Experiments on their datasets and others demonstrate generating high-quality full-body reactions in challenging collaborative settings between humans and humanoids.
