# [An Expert is Worth One Token: Synergizing Multiple Expert LLMs as   Generalist via Expert Token Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16854)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
How to synergize multiple expert large language models (LLMs) into a unified generalist framework to leverage their specialized knowledge without requiring users to explicitly switch between different expert LLMs. Existing methods have limitations - prompt-based methods rely on properly designed instructions to invoke experts which is inefficient for implicit expertise, while router-based methods require retraining the router when new expert LLMs are added.

Proposed Solution:
Expert Token Routing (ETR): Represents each expert LLM as a special "expert token" in the vocabulary of a generalist "meta" LLM. The meta LLM can route to an expert by generating its corresponding token, allowing seamless collaboration without exposing complexity to users. ETR learns routing from existing datasets without extra annotations. New expert LLMs can be dynamically added by plugging in their trained expert tokens without modifying the frozen meta LLM.

Main Contributions:
1) Novel ETR method to unify multiple expert LLMs into a singular framework that conceals collaboration details, facilitating interaction like a single LLM.
2) Learns implicit expertise of experts from data without needing explicit depictions. Enables plug-and-play extension of new experts.
3) Comprehensive evaluation across 6 diverse expert domains shows ETR significantly outperforms existing multi-LLM paradigms. Establishes effectiveness of synergizing experts into generalist system.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective approach ETR for collaborating multiple expert LLMs in a singular generalist framework. Key advantages are supporting implicit expertise, dynamic extension of experts, and ease of use from user perspective. Experiments showcase robust performance improvements across diverse expert domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents Expert-Token-Routing, a framework that enables seamless integration and collaboration of multiple expert language models by encoding them as special tokens within the vocabulary of a meta language model for improved performance across diverse domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The introduction of a singular generalist framework that facilitates seamless integration and collaboration of expert LLMs. This framework not only supports learning the implicit expertise of expert LLMs from existing instruction dataset but also allows for dynamic extension of new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. The effectiveness of the framework is showcased across benchmarks that incorporate six diverse expert domains.

In other words, the paper proposes a new method called Expert-Token-Routing (ETR) to synergize multiple expert large language models (LLMs) into a unified generalist LLM system. ETR represents each expert LLM as a special token in the vocabulary of a meta LLM. This allows the meta LLM to route queries to the appropriate expert LLM by generating the corresponding expert token. A key advantage of ETR is its ability to learn implicit expertise of expert LLMs and to dynamically extend with new expert LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ETR across tasks requiring expertise in six diverse domains.
