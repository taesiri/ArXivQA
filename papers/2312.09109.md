# [VideoLCM: Video Latent Consistency Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09109)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes VideoLCM, a video latent consistency model that enables efficient high-quality video synthesis with minimal sampling steps. VideoLCM builds upon existing latent diffusion models for video generation and incorporates consistency distillation techniques to train the latent consistency model. Specifically, VideoLCM leverages a pretrained teacher video diffusion model and distills its knowledge into a student consistency model that learns to map points from any timestep to the trajectory start. Once trained, VideoLCM can generate videos with only 4-6 sampling steps while maintaining quality comparable to 50 steps, showcasing its potential for real-time synthesis. Experiments are conducted on text-to-video generation and compositional video synthesis tasks. Results demonstrate VideoLCM's efficiency and ability to produce visually appealing videos with temporal continuity using dramatically fewer steps than prior work. The paper introduces an effective baseline for fast video synthesis to the research community.
