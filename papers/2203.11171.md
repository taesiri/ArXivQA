# Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: Can introducing self-consistency over diverse reasoning paths improve the performance of chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning tasks? The key ideas are:- Chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise for improving language models' reasoning abilities, but still uses greedy decoding to generate a single chain of reasoning.- The authors propose that complex reasoning tasks often admit multiple valid reasoning paths leading to the correct solution. - They introduce a new decoding strategy called "self-consistency" that samples diverse reasoning paths from the language model, then aggregates answers by choosing the most frequent final answer.- The intuition is that if multiple reasoning paths give the same answer, there is greater confidence the answer is correct.- This approach is evaluated extensively across arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.- Results show large gains over greedy chain-of-thought prompting across tasks and model scales, achieving new state-of-the-art on many benchmarks.In summary, the central hypothesis is that sampling diverse reasoning paths and aggregating the most consistent answer can substantially improve performance of chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning. The results appear to validate this hypothesis across a range of models and reasoning tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new decoding strategy called "self-consistency" to improve the performance of chain-of-thought prompting with large language models on reasoning tasks. Specifically, the key ideas are:- Chain-of-thought prompting has shown promise for improving reasoning capabilities of language models by prompting them to generate an explicit reasoning process before outputting the final answer. - The paper proposes self-consistency as an improved decoding strategy over the greedy decoding used in prior chain-of-thought prompting work. - Self-consistency involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths from the language model's decoder, then aggregating the answers by choosing the most frequent final answer. This exploits the intuition that correct reasoning processes tend to agree on the final answer.- Empirically, self-consistency is shown to substantially boost accuracy over greedy decoding for chain-of-thought prompting on a range of arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, across multiple language models.- The method is simple, unsupervised, and does not require any additional training or annotation.In summary, the key contribution is proposing and demonstrating the effectiveness of the self-consistency decoding strategy to improve reasoning performance of language models prompted with chains of thought. The simplicity and unsupervised nature of the approach are also notable.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new decoding strategy called self-consistency for chain-of-thought prompting in large language models, which samples diverse reasoning paths from the model and marginalizes out the paths to pick the most consistent answer, improving performance on a range of reasoning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of improving reasoning in language models:- This paper introduces a novel method called "self-consistency" that improves the performance of chain-of-thought prompting in language models for reasoning tasks. Other recent work has focused on training additional models like verifiers or re-rankers to improve reasoning, which requires extra supervision. In contrast, self-consistency is unsupervised and works directly with off-the-shelf language models.- The idea of generating multiple diverse reasoning paths and aggregating answers is creative and different from prior work. Most existing work uses greedy decoding or beam search which can get stuck in local optima. Self-consistency explores the space of reasoning in a more global, probabilistic way.- The empirical gains from self-consistency over chain-of-thought prompting are quite significant, leading to new SOTA results on many reasoning benchmarks. These improvements are surprising given that other approaches require task-specific training. Self-consistency seems to robustly improve reasoning across tasks and model scales.- An interesting aspect is that self-consistency works by sampling from the decoder. Most prior work that uses sampling focuses on open-ended generation. This paper shows sampling can be useful even for tasks with fixed answers by coupling it with answer aggregation.- One limitation is that self-consistency incurs more compute cost than greedy decoding. But it's simple and doesn't require training anything extra. It would be interesting to see follow-up work that reduces the inference cost.Overall, self-consistency seems like a novel and meaningful contribution compared to prior work on improving reasoning in language models. The core ideas have not been explored before and appear generalizable. The empirical gains are substantial and could potentially impact how decoding is done for reasoning tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring other ways to introduce diversity into the reasoning paths besides sampling from the decoder, such as incorporating stochastic latent variables into the model architecture.- Applying self-consistency to other tasks beyond reasoning where intermediate reasoning steps are useful, such as program execution. The authors suggest self-consistency could be useful whenever there are intermediate steps that lead to a final output.- Using self-consistency to generate better training data, then fine-tuning the model so it can make accurate predictions in one inference pass rather than needing multiple samples at test time.- Extending self-consistency beyond cases where the final answer set is fixed, to open-ended text generation tasks. The authors suggest defining notions of consistency between multiple open-ended generations.- Improving the grounding of the generated reasoning paths, so they are more factual and avoid generating incorrect or nonsensical rationales.- Using the consistency between sampled outputs as an uncertainty estimate, to improve model calibration and allow the model to "know when it doesn't know".- Combining self-consistency with other methods like training re-rankers or additional verifiers to further improve results.In summary, the main future directions are exploring variants of self-consistency, applying it to new tasks, using it to improve training, and combining it with complementary methods to further boost accuracy and calibration. The authors focus on improving the diversity, consistency and grounding of the generated reasoning paths as ways to enhance the benefits of self-consistency.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new decoding strategy called self-consistency to improve chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models. Chain-of-thought prompting gets a model to generate a step-by-step reasoning process leading to an answer, but uses greedy decoding which can be error-prone. Self-consistency instead samples multiple diverse reasoning paths from the model, then aggregates by choosing the most frequent final answer, under the intuition that correct reasoning tends to reach consensus. Experiments over four language models (UL2, GPT-3, LaMDA, PaLM) on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning datasets show self-consistency substantially boosts accuracy over greedy decoding, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The method requires no training or fine-tuning, works off-the-shelf with pre-trained LMs, and is shown to be robust to choice of sampling scheme and imperfect prompts. The consistency between sampled paths also provides uncertainty estimates.
