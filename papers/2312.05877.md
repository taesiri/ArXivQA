# [Proceedings of the 2023 XCSP3 Competition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05877)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the proceedings of the XCSP3 Competition 2023, including the problem set, models, solvers, and results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is:

Presenting the proceedings of the XCSP3 Competition 2023, including the problem set, models, solvers, and results. Specifically, it provides:

- A description of the 36 constraint satisfaction and optimization problems selected for the competition, as well as the Python/PyCSP3 models used to generate the XCSP3 instances. The problems cover a diverse set of global constraints and aim to challenge the scalability of solvers.

- An overview of the 15 solvers and teams that participated in the various tracks of the competition.

- The competition framework, rules and cluster infrastructure used for the standardized evaluation of the solvers.

- The final rankings of the top-performing solvers in each track, based on their ability to find solutions or good quality bounds within the specified time limits.

In summary, it documents the methodology, benchmark instances, competitors, and outcomes of the latest iteration of this annual constraint solving competition. The results showcase the state-of-the-art in combinatorial search and provide standardized benchmarks to drive further progress.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- XCSP3 - An integrated format for representing and solving constraint satisfaction/optimization problems
- Constraint programming 
- Combinatorial problems
- Global constraints
- Problem models
- Solver descriptions
- Competition results and rankings

The paper introduces the XCSP3 format and constraint models for the problems used in the 2023 XCSP3 Competition. It provides descriptions of the solvers participating in the competition and presents the competition results and rankings across different tracks like CSP, COP, Fast COP, Parallel COP, Mini CSP and Mini COP. So the key terms reflect this focus on constraint modeling and solving through a common format evaluated in a competition setting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new integrated format called XCSP3 for representing combinatorial constrained problems. What are some of the key features of this format and how does it improve upon previous standardized formats for CSPs?

2. The paper discusses a variety of global constraints that are supported in XCSP3 such as intension, extension, regular, MDD, element, and more. Can you explain the difference between intension and extension constraints and discuss when one might be preferred over the other?  

3. The XCSP3 format supports representing both satisfaction problems (CSPs) and optimization problems (COPs). What extra components need to be specified in XCSP3 to define a COP compared to a CSP?

4. The paper talks about the core of the XCSP3 format called XCSP3-core. What is included in this core format and what additional features does the full XCSP3 format support beyond the core? What was the motivation for defining this simplified core format?

5. Can you walk through the Python API for building XCSP3 problem instances discussed in Section 4.6 of the paper? What are some of the key functions and data structures for constructing variables, domains, constraints etc.?  

6. The XCSP3 format was designed to be independent of any solver technology. What considerations went into the design to make it solver-independent and support a wide range of solving techniques?

7. The paper covers specialized global constraints like regular and MDD for language-based constraints. Can you explain how these constraints work at a high level and what types of problems they would be useful for? 

8. Section 5 of the paper discusses different techniques for symmetry breaking in XCSP3. Can you summarize some of these techniques and how a modeler could specify symmetry breaking in the format?

9. What kinds of metadata can be included in XCSP3 instances? What is an example usage of tags as discussed in Section 4.5 and how might solvers take advantage of these tags?

10. The paper introduces the XCSP3 repository for sharing benchmark problems. Can you discuss the motivation and usefulness of such a standardized repository compared to other CSP libraries?
