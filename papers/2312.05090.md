 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel universal reinforcement learning (RL) framework called UniTSA for traffic signal control (TSC) in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) environments. UniTSA introduces a junction matrix representation to characterize intersection states in a consistent manner across varying topologies. To enhance generalization, five tailored traffic state augmentation techniques are proposed, including movement shuffling, change of lane numbers, traffic flow scaling, Gaussian noise addition, and masking. These expose the RL agent to more diverse intersections during training. For inference, UniTSA employs a ``keep or change phase'' action space to ensure safety. Experiments across 12 distinct intersections demonstrate UniTSA's superiority over previous TSC methods, cutting average waiting times by over 40\% on unseen intersections. Notably, fine-tuning UniTSA's pretrained model on new intersections achieves comparable performance to training from scratch, but with 66% less computation. Overall, UniTSA offers an efficient, scalable and high-performing solution for real-world V2X-based traffic management.
