# [Efficient Search and Learning for Agile Locomotion on Stepping Stones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03639)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Controlling legged robots to perform highly dynamic maneuvers such as jumping between stepping stones is challenging. It requires making decisions over both continuous variables (e.g. contact forces) and discrete variables (e.g. choosing which stone to step on next). Existing methods either do not scale well as the number of discrete options increases, do not account for full-body dynamics leading to failed plans, or require substantial reward engineering and multi-stage training.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a framework that combines model-based control, search, and learning. 
1) Use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to generate whole-body motions for a given contact plan. 
2) To efficiently search for an optimal contact plan, use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) which scales better than mixed-integer programming approaches. MCTS evaluates each candidate plan by rolling out the NMPC, ensuring dynamic feasibility.
3) Learn a goal-conditioned policy via supervised learning on dataset of optimal plans found by MCTS. Use diffusion models to handle multi-modality.  

The learned policy reactively selects the next contact locations given current state and environment. It is combined with the NMPC in a closed loop.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework combining MCTS, NMPC and learning for agile legged locomotion in highly constrained environments
- MCTS with full dynamics rollout for evaluating candidate contact plans  
- Showing diffusion models can effectively handle multi-modality in expert dataset  
- Learned policy successfully controls quadruped to jump to goals in stepping stone environments, replanning when stones are removed

The key innovation is using MCTS with an accurate dynamics model (NMPC) for planning, instead of simplified models, while still being efficient enough for online use via learning. This avoids failed plans and reward engineering issues of other methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework combining model-based control, search, and learning for efficient locomotion of legged robots on highly constrained environments like stepping stones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Presenting a novel framework that takes the structure of the dynamics of the robot and the environment to efficiently control legged robots in highly limited environments (stepping stones).

2) Showing through a systematic comparison that diffusion models are an ideal candidate to learn from expert data when multi-modality is present in the dataset. 

3) Demonstrating automatic online surface selection for dynamic quadrupedal locomotion through a learned feedback policy.

So in summary, the key contributions are proposing an efficient framework for agile legged locomotion combining model-based control, search, and learning, comparing neural network architectures for handling multi-modality, and showing reactive control of quadrupedal jumping and stepping stone navigation through a learned policy.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for contact planning. What are the main advantages of MCTS over other contact planning methods like mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP)? How does MCTS scale better as the number of discrete variables increases?

2. The reward function for MCTS uses the L2 distance between current and goal end-effector locations. How sensitive is the performance of MCTS to the design of this reward function? Have the authors experimented with other reward formulations?

3. The paper uses nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to evaluate complete rollouts in MCTS instead of simply relying on a simplified model. What impact does this more accurate dynamics model have on the quality of the contact plans found by MCTS?

4. For learning the contact planner policy, why did the authors choose supervised learning over extending MCTS with a learnable value function? What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

5. Why are diffusion models well-suited for handling the multi-modality of the MCTS demonstration data? How does the U-Net architecture help leverage the structure of the problem?

6. The stepping stones environment has discrete feasible locations for contacts. How does the pointer network architecture take advantage of this to avoid the need for projecting the network output?

7. What impact did the DDIM training approach have on balancing training time versus number of diffusion steps used during inference? How was the inference quality impacted?

8. For replanning in dynamic environments, what are possible reasons the learned policy only succeeded 22% of the time when stones were removed? How could the policy be improved?

9. The current framework optimizes contact locations but keeps the gait pattern fixed. How feasible would it be to also optimize over gait patterns? What changes would need to be made?

10. The paper demonstrates results in simulation. What key challenges need to be addressed to deploy the complete system on real hardware?
