# [Budgeted Online Model Selection and Fine-Tuning via Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10478)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of online model selection with a large dictionary of candidate models in resource constrained edge devices. Specifically, edge devices have limited memory and cannot store a large number of machine learning models. However, having access to a diverse dictionary of models can improve the accuracy and adaptability of online model selection. The paper aims to enable edge devices to perform online model selection from a large dictionary of models stored on a server, while coping with the limited memory capacity of edge devices.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Online Federated Model Selection and Fine-Tuning (OFMS-FT) algorithm. The key ideas are:

1) A server with large memory stores a dictionary of models. Edge devices (clients) can only store a subset of models based on their memory budget. 

2) At each round, each client selects and stores a personalized subset of models from the dictionary based on a probability distribution that captures the credibility of each model. The client then makes a prediction using one of its stored models.

3) Clients compute and update losses for the stored models. These losses are used to update the probability distribution and select models in future rounds.

4) Clients and server collaborate to fine-tune the dictionary of models over time to adapt them to non-stationary data distributions. A bandwidth-aware client selection method is used for fine-tuning due to limited communication bandwidth.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel online federated learning framework that enables edge devices with limited memory to perform online model selection from a large dictionary of models stored on a server.

2) Personalized model subset selection and fine-tuning strategy for each client based on observed losses and resource constraints.

3) Regret analysis proving that both clients and server achieve sub-linear regret guarantees with respect to best model in hindsight.

4) Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrating improved accuracy compared to non-federated and single model federated methods.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in enabling online model selection under resource constraints in federated edge networks through novel personalized model selection and fine-tuning strategies with theoretical regret guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an online federated learning algorithm that enables clients with limited memory to collaborate with a server to perform online model selection from a large set of candidate models and fine-tune the models over time to adapt to non-stationary data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an online federated learning algorithm called OFMS-FT that enables clients with limited memory to perform online model selection from a large dictionary of models stored at a server. Specifically:

- It allows clients to collaborate with a server that stores a large dictionary of models to perform online model selection and prediction, while each client only needs to store a small subset of models based on its memory budget. 

- It introduces a principled framework for clients to select and evaluate multiple models per round in an online fashion, despite their limited memory, in order to identify well-performing models faster.

- It enables online fine-tuning of the dictionary of models stored at the server through partial model updates from clients to adapt them to non-stationary data distributions.

- It provides theoretical analysis to show that both the clients and server enjoy sub-linear regret bounds with respect to the best model in hindsight. The analysis also demonstrates the benefits of increasing client memory budgets and server-to-client communication bandwidth.

- It validates the proposed OFMS-FT algorithm empirically on real-world image classification and regression tasks, showing performance improvements over non-federated and single-model federated baselines.

In summary, the key innovation is developing an online federated learning approach to address the limitations of clients with small memory capacities in effectively utilizing and adapting to a large dictionary of machine learning models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an online federated learning framework for model selection. What are the key challenges in enabling online model selection with a large dictionary of models, especially when learners (clients) have limited memory capacity? How does the proposed framework aim to address these challenges?

2. What is the motivation behind having clients compute losses and update weights for multiple models at each round, instead of just the selected model? How does this impact the regret bounds?

3. Explain the model subset selection procedure outlined in Steps 5-7 of Algorithm 1. In particular, discuss how clustering models and randomly choosing a cluster allows clients to evaluate more models under a limited budget. 

4. The server aggregates model updates from only a subset of clients at each round. What considerations need to be made in determining this subset? How is the communication bandwidth limitation handled?

5. The regret analysis shows that increasing client memory budgets leads to tighter regret bounds. Intuitively explain why this is the case and how having a higher budget impacts the algorithm design and analysis.  

6. How does handling non-i.i.d. data distributions across clients impact the regret definitions and analysis? Does the proposed method account for heterogeneity in data distributions?

7. The importance sampling loss estimates are key to enabling loss computations for models not stored by a client. Explain how these estimates are obtained and why they allow more flexibility in model selection.

8. Compare and contrast the proposed online federated approach with standard online learning algorithms. What modifications need to be made to account for federated learning aspects?

9. The cluster selection procedure induces randomness which impacts the regret. Discuss how this randomness is accounted for in the probability definitions and subsequent analysis. 

10. Beyond memory limitations, what other practical challenges arise in online federated learning settings? How might the analysis change if communication rounds are less frequent?
