# [Identifying Student Profiles Within Online Judge Systems Using   Explainable Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online Judge (OJ) systems are used to automatically evaluate and grade programming assignments in an educational context. However, they only provide feedback on whether the submitted code passes the tests, but no additional insights that could help identify student learning patterns or behaviors related to success/failure on the assignments.

- It would be useful to exploit the educational data mining (EDM) paradigm to extract such additional feedback from OJ systems to provide to both students and instructors. However, EDM methods like machine learning are often "black boxes" lacking interpretability. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use a multi-instance learning (MIL) framework to model student behavior based on their multiple code submissions to OJ system for an assignment. Each student is a "bag" of their submissions.

- Map the MIL representation to a classic machine learning task to enable use of explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP for interpretability. Propose a novel mapping policy of selecting label with maximum confidence score.

- Use SHAP for post-hoc explanations to quantify the impact of features like time to deadline, number of submissions to date, etc. on outcome.

- Do cohort analysis to divide population into subgroups to study assignment success and extract student profiles.

Contributions:
- Novel MIL-to-ML mapping policy to enable XAI methods for interpretability
- Workflow to gather insights on student profiles/behaviors and provide actionable feedback to both students and instructors
- Analysis of case study with 2500+ submissions in programming course over 3 years
- Identification of prone-to-fail student groups based on submission patterns

The proposal is validated by experiments showing the ML model can predict student outcome and provide interpretable explanations for the prediction. Key variables influencing success are identified. At-risk student groups are detected early to enable interventions.
