# [Identifying Student Profiles Within Online Judge Systems Using   Explainable Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03948)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online Judge (OJ) systems are used to automatically evaluate and grade programming assignments in an educational context. However, they only provide feedback on whether the submitted code passes the tests, but no additional insights that could help identify student learning patterns or behaviors related to success/failure on the assignments.

- It would be useful to exploit the educational data mining (EDM) paradigm to extract such additional feedback from OJ systems to provide to both students and instructors. However, EDM methods like machine learning are often "black boxes" lacking interpretability. 

Proposed Solution:
- Use a multi-instance learning (MIL) framework to model student behavior based on their multiple code submissions to OJ system for an assignment. Each student is a "bag" of their submissions.

- Map the MIL representation to a classic machine learning task to enable use of explainable AI (XAI) methods like SHAP for interpretability. Propose a novel mapping policy of selecting label with maximum confidence score.

- Use SHAP for post-hoc explanations to quantify the impact of features like time to deadline, number of submissions to date, etc. on outcome.

- Do cohort analysis to divide population into subgroups to study assignment success and extract student profiles.

Contributions:
- Novel MIL-to-ML mapping policy to enable XAI methods for interpretability
- Workflow to gather insights on student profiles/behaviors and provide actionable feedback to both students and instructors
- Analysis of case study with 2500+ submissions in programming course over 3 years
- Identification of prone-to-fail student groups based on submission patterns

The proposal is validated by experiments showing the ML model can predict student outcome and provide interpretable explanations for the prediction. Key variables influencing success are identified. At-risk student groups are detected early to enable interventions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a method to identify student profiles and provide feedback in educational online judge systems using explainable artificial intelligence applied to multi-instance learning models of student submission data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method to identify student profiles and provide feedback in educational online judge (OJ) systems using multi-instance learning and explainable AI techniques. Specifically:

- They propose using multi-instance learning to model student behavior based on their code submissions to an OJ system. Each student is represented as a "bag" of their submissions.

- They propose a method to map the multi-instance learning problem to a classic machine learning problem to enable the use of explainable AI techniques.

- They apply explainable AI, specifically SHAP values, to provide interpretable feedback relating the features extracted from OJ submissions to the prediction of whether students will pass/fail assignments. 

- They validate their method on a case study from a programming course with over 2,500 submissions. The method is able to effectively predict student outcomes and identify at-risk student groups to provide feedback.

In summary, the main contribution is a practical method to provide personalized and interpretable feedback in OJ systems by modeling student behavior with multi-instance learning and explainable AI.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) framework to model student behavior based on code submissions. What are the key advantages of using an MIL approach compared to traditional machine learning methods in this context?

2. The paper maps the MIL problem to a classic machine learning task to enable the use of Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. What is the rationale behind this mapping and what are the steps involved in the proposed mapping policy?

3. The Random Forest (RF) method is identified as the optimal learning algorithm. What are the key properties of RF that make it well-suited for the student profile identification task compared to other machine learning algorithms studied in the paper?

4. The paper uses the SHAP method for explainable AI. What are Shapley values and how do they help explain the importance of different features in the RF model predictions?

5. The paper defines 6 variables related to student code submissions. Discuss the relevance and interpretability of these variables in identifying at-risk students based on the XAI analysis. 

6. The cohort analysis divides students into risk groups. What is the key criterion used for cohort creation and how does it relate to student success? Discuss the findings.

7. The XAI analysis shows days to deadline as the most influential variable. What implications does this have on the course design and student mentoring to ensure success?

8. How robust is the proposed approach? Discuss the limitations of using 3 years of data from a single programming course for model development and testing.  

9. The paper aims to provide actionable feedback to instructors and students. In your opinion, does the XAI analysis meet this objective and what improvements can be made?

10. The paper focuses on programming courses. Do you think the approach is generalizable to other STEM courses involving code submissions and evaluations? What adaptations may be required?
