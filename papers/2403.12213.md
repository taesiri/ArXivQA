# [Private graphon estimation via sum-of-squares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12213)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating stochastic block models and graphons (closely related concepts) in a node differentially private manner is challenging as global statistics are highly sensitive to changes in nodes. 
- Previous algorithms achieve information-theoretic optimal errors, but require exponential time. Open question whether polynomial time algorithms exist with similar guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop polynomial-time node differentially private algorithms for estimating stochastic block models and graphons, matching error rates of previous exponential-time approaches.
- Key ideas:
    - Formulate alternative characterization of graphon/block model distance relying on quadratic optimization over polytope of doubly stochastic matrices. Use this to define score function.
    - Employ sum-of-squares based exponential mechanism, by extending spectral HÃ¶lder's inequality to certify low-rank structure with sum-of-squares.
    - Perform Lipschitz extensions within the sum-of-squares framework to make algorithms robust. 
    - Show that low-degree sum-of-squares hierarchy yields good multiplicative approximation guarantees for quadratic optimization over polytopes.

Main Contributions:
- First polynomial-time node differentially private algorithms for estimating stochastic block models and graphons, matching information-theoretic optimal error rates.
- New analysis based on sum-of-squares proofs establishing concentration bounds and identifiability results for these models.
- Obtains state-of-the-art guarantees even in the non-private setting, overcoming limitations of spectral methods.
- Provides evidence that achieving better error guarantees is inherently intractable for polynomial-time algorithms.

In summary, the paper develops the first efficient differentially private algorithms for estimating fundamental random graph models, relying on sum-of-squares proofs and optimization methods tailored to these problems. The analysis provides insight into the achievable accuracy given computational constraints.
