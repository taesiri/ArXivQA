# [Private graphon estimation via sum-of-squares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12213)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Estimating stochastic block models and graphons (closely related concepts) in a node differentially private manner is challenging as global statistics are highly sensitive to changes in nodes. 
- Previous algorithms achieve information-theoretic optimal errors, but require exponential time. Open question whether polynomial time algorithms exist with similar guarantees.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop polynomial-time node differentially private algorithms for estimating stochastic block models and graphons, matching error rates of previous exponential-time approaches.
- Key ideas:
    - Formulate alternative characterization of graphon/block model distance relying on quadratic optimization over polytope of doubly stochastic matrices. Use this to define score function.
    - Employ sum-of-squares based exponential mechanism, by extending spectral Hölder's inequality to certify low-rank structure with sum-of-squares.
    - Perform Lipschitz extensions within the sum-of-squares framework to make algorithms robust. 
    - Show that low-degree sum-of-squares hierarchy yields good multiplicative approximation guarantees for quadratic optimization over polytopes.

Main Contributions:
- First polynomial-time node differentially private algorithms for estimating stochastic block models and graphons, matching information-theoretic optimal error rates.
- New analysis based on sum-of-squares proofs establishing concentration bounds and identifiability results for these models.
- Obtains state-of-the-art guarantees even in the non-private setting, overcoming limitations of spectral methods.
- Provides evidence that achieving better error guarantees is inherently intractable for polynomial-time algorithms.

In summary, the paper develops the first efficient differentially private algorithms for estimating fundamental random graph models, relying on sum-of-squares proofs and optimization methods tailored to these problems. The analysis provides insight into the achievable accuracy given computational constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper develops the first polynomial-time node-differentially private algorithms for learning stochastic block models and graphon estimation that match the utility guarantees of previous exponential-time algorithms. Specifically:

- It gives the first pure node differentially private polynomial time algorithm for stochastic block model parameter estimation. The error rate matches previous exponential time algorithms in the literature, up to an information-computation gap.

- It gives a polynomial time node differentially private algorithm for graphon estimation. The error rate matches previous exponential time algorithms, except for an extra term that is necessary for polynomial time algorithms. 

- The algorithms are based on using exponential mechanism with a score function defined based on a sum-of-squares relaxation. A key technical contribution is a characterization of graphon/SBM distance in terms of optimizing a quadratic polynomial over the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices.

- The paper also shows a lower bound that the extra sample complexity term in the utility guarantee compared to edge differential privacy is necessary.

In summary, the main contribution is developing the first computationally efficient node differentially private algorithms for graph parameter estimation with tight utility guarantees. It bridges the gap between information-theoretic and computational complexity in this problem.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Node-differential privacy - The paper develops node-differentially private algorithms, which aim to protect the privacy of individual nodes (vertices) in a graph. This is more stringent than edge-differential privacy.

- Stochastic block model (SBM) - A generative graph model where vertices belong to blocks/communities and edges are generated probabilistically based on block memberships. The paper gives node-private algorithms for estimating SBM parameters.  

- Graphon estimation - Graphons are a nonparametric way of representing network data. The paper gives node-private algorithms for estimating graphons.

- Sum-of-squares - A framework and hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations and algorithms. The paper uses sum-of-squares to design computationally efficient node-private graph algorithms.

- Polynomial time algorithms - A main contribution is developing the first polynomial time node-differentially private algorithms for tasks like SBM and graphon estimation, as previous algorithms took exponential time.  

- Robust estimation - The paper shows the algorithms are robust in that they work even when the generative model is perturbed or misses some assumptions.

- Information-computation tradeoffs - There is evidence these node-private algorithms match information-theoretic limits on what can be achieved efficiently.

So in summary, key terms cover differential privacy variants, graph models, the sum-of-squares technique, runtime bounds, robustness, and information-computation gaps.
