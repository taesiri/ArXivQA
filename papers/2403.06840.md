# [RA-ISF: Learning to Answer and Understand from Retrieval Augmentation   via Iterative Self-Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "RA-ISF: Learning to Answer and Understand from Retrieval Augmentation via Iterative Self-Feedback":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on the knowledge stored in their parameters, which can be incomplete or outdated. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods address this by retrieving relevant external knowledge to incorporate into the model's prompts. However, irrelevant retrieved texts can negatively impact the model's performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose RA-ISF, a framework with 3 modules - Self-Knowledge, Passage Relevance, and Question Decomposition - that iteratively processes questions to enhance the model's problem-solving capabilities.

- The Self-Knowledge Module determines if the question can be answered by the model's own knowledge. If not, retrieval is used.

- The Passage Relevance Module filters out irrelevant retrieved passages. Only relevant ones are incorporated into the prompt. 

- If no passages are relevant, the Question Decomposition Module breaks the question into simpler sub-questions. Each sub-question is then fed back into the framework to be solved iteratively. 

- Finally, the answers to the sub-questions are synthesized to respond to the original question.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an iterative retrieval augmentation approach with self-feedback that evaluates model's ability to solve problems and relevance of retrieved texts.

- Utilizes question decomposition when model lacks knowledge or retrieves irrelevant text, breaking down complex questions into simpler ones.

- Outperforms previous benchmarks across several datasets and models. Significantly enhances factual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations.

In summary, RA-ISF is an innovative framework that combines the model's strengths with retrieval augmentation and task decomposition for improved question answering, especially for complex, knowledge-intensive questions. The iterative processing and self-feedback mitigate issues caused by irrelevant retrieved content.
