# [RA-ISF: Learning to Answer and Understand from Retrieval Augmentation   via Iterative Self-Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06840)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "RA-ISF: Learning to Answer and Understand from Retrieval Augmentation via Iterative Self-Feedback":

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on the knowledge stored in their parameters, which can be incomplete or outdated. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods address this by retrieving relevant external knowledge to incorporate into the model's prompts. However, irrelevant retrieved texts can negatively impact the model's performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose RA-ISF, a framework with 3 modules - Self-Knowledge, Passage Relevance, and Question Decomposition - that iteratively processes questions to enhance the model's problem-solving capabilities.

- The Self-Knowledge Module determines if the question can be answered by the model's own knowledge. If not, retrieval is used.

- The Passage Relevance Module filters out irrelevant retrieved passages. Only relevant ones are incorporated into the prompt. 

- If no passages are relevant, the Question Decomposition Module breaks the question into simpler sub-questions. Each sub-question is then fed back into the framework to be solved iteratively. 

- Finally, the answers to the sub-questions are synthesized to respond to the original question.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces an iterative retrieval augmentation approach with self-feedback that evaluates model's ability to solve problems and relevance of retrieved texts.

- Utilizes question decomposition when model lacks knowledge or retrieves irrelevant text, breaking down complex questions into simpler ones.

- Outperforms previous benchmarks across several datasets and models. Significantly enhances factual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations.

In summary, RA-ISF is an innovative framework that combines the model's strengths with retrieval augmentation and task decomposition for improved question answering, especially for complex, knowledge-intensive questions. The iterative processing and self-feedback mitigate issues caused by irrelevant retrieved content.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a retrieval augmented iterative self-feedback (RA-ISF) framework that enhances language models' reasoning capabilities by iteratively evaluating and incorporating internal knowledge, external retrieved knowledge, and question decomposition.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It introduces RA-ISF, an innovative retrieval-augmented framework designed to tackle diverse challenges. This approach evaluates the model's ability to solve the corresponding problem and its relevance to the retrieved content through an iterative method. 

2. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time an iterative question decomposition approach has been used in a retrieval-augmented framework, which mitigates the impact of irrelevant text interference.

3. The proposed framework significantly enhances knowledge retrieval performance across different tasks, demonstrating the potential and robustness of the framework.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the RA-ISF framework that utilizes iterative processing with three submodules (self-knowledge, passage relevance, question decomposition) to improve retrieval augmentation and enhance model performance in question answering. This allows for better incorporation of external knowledge while reducing the impact of irrelevant retrieved texts.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG): Using retrieved external knowledge texts to augment language model prompts for improved performance.

- Iterative self-feedback: The paper's proposed approach of iteratively processing questions through self-knowledge checks, passage relevance assessments, and question decomposition. 

- Self-knowledge module: One of the three submodules that checks if a question can be answered by the model's own knowledge.

- Passage relevance module: Submodule that evaluates whether retrieved passages are relevant to the input question.

- Question decomposition module: Breaks down questions into simpler sub-questions when existing knowledge is insufficient.

- In-context learning: Technique used to train the three submodules by providing examples in the context.

- Knowledge reasoning: Ability of models to reason about facts and world knowledge to answer questions.

- Hallucination: Issue in LLMs where they generate incorrect or unsupported answers.

The key focus of the paper is leveraging retrieval to enhance reasoning while mitigating issues like hallucination through iterative assessment of self-knowledge and passage relevance supplemented by question decomposition when needed. The submodules and overall framework aim to address limitations in existing RAG approaches.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the RA-ISF method proposed in the paper:

1. How does the Self-Knowledge Module determine whether a question can be answered using the model's internal knowledge? What specific techniques or processes does it use to make this assessment?

2. In the Passage Relevance Module, what criteria or metrics does the model use to judge whether a retrieved passage is relevant to the input question? How was the model trained to make accurate relevance judgments?  

3. What types of question decomposition strategies does the Question Decomposition Module employ when breaking down complex questions into simpler sub-questions? How does it ensure the sub-questions remain semantically consistent with the original question?

4. How do the three sub-modules collectively handle situations where all retrieved passages are deemed irrelevant and the Question Decomposition Module also fails to produce useful sub-questions for a given complex question?

5. What mechanisms does RA-ISF have in place to prevent excessive branching when iteratively decomposing questions? How does it determine when further decomposition becomes unproductive?  

6. How does RA-ISF synthesize the answers to multiple sub-questions to produce a final cohesive answer to the original question? What techniques does it use?

7. In what ways could the modular design of RA-ISF be adapted or extended to incorporate additional capabilities for knowledge reasoning and question answering?

8. How resilient is RA-ISF to incorrectly labeled or misleading data used in training the three sub-modules? How could the framework be made more robust?  

9. What types of complex open-domain questions does RA-ISF still struggle with? What enhancements could address these remaining challenges?

10. How feasible would it be to replace the large LM used for final answer generation with an ensemble of smaller expert models tailored to different question types? What would be the tradeoffs?
