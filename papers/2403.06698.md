# [PCLD: Point Cloud Layerwise Diffusion for Adversarial Purification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Point cloud deep learning models have shown great success in various applications like autonomous driving and robotics. However, they have been found vulnerable against adversarial attacks which craft imperceptible perturbations to inputs to cause misclassifications. Defenses against such attacks are critical for safety-critical applications. While adversarial training and input purification defenses exist, study of layerwise defenses has been limited. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Point Cloud Layerwise Diffusion (PCLD), a novel defense strategy that purifies adversarial noise in a layerwise manner using diffusion probabilistic models. 

Key ideas:
- Adversarial noise accumulates and gets farther from clean features as it propagates through layers.
- Diffusion models can learn clean data distributions and map noisy inputs back to true distribution.
- PCLD trains diffusion models for each layer to capture their true distributions. 
- During inference, each layer's features are purified by mapped back to true distribution by corresponding diffusion model in a truncated reverse diffusion process.

Contributions:
- Introduces assumption of adversarial drift at each layer and formalizes layerwise diffusion based purification.
- Proposes PCLD algorithm for layerwise purification using per-layer diffusion models.
- Shows state-of-the-art or comparable defense performance of PCLD against various attacks on multiple benchmark point cloud models. 
- Demonstrates significance of deeper layer purifications.
- Establishes effectiveness of layerwise diffusion defense strategy for point cloud models.

In summary, the paper presents PCLD, a novel layerwise defense approach using diffusion models to enhance robustness of point cloud deep learning models against adversarial attacks. Experiments verify its state-of-the-art performance.
