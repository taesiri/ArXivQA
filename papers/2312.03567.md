# [XAIQA: Explainer-Based Data Augmentation for Extractive Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03567)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces XAIQA, a novel method for generating synthetic question-answer pairs from electronic health records to augment training data for extractive question answering models. XAIQA leverages model explainability techniques to identify important sentences from medical documents that serve as grounded answers to questions about medical concepts. In an expert evaluation, XAIQA generated question-answer pairs exhibited greater semantic complexity and more clinical abbreviations compared to pairs generated using sentence encoders. When provided as few-shot examples to the GPT-4 language model for extractive QA, XAIQA pairs improved performance over zero-shot and sentence encoder baselines, especially on difficult questions with low keyword overlap. The paper demonstrates XAIQA's ability to uncover grounded yet non-obvious relationships between questions and answers for improving QA models. Key advantages are the method's scalability, its avoidance of abstractive answers, and introduction of clinical semantic matches between questions and answers beyond lexical similarity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces XAIQA, a novel method to generate grounded, semantically complex question-answer pairs at scale from electronic health records by exploiting the symmetry between explaining document classifiers and forming QA pairs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing XAIQA, a novel method to generate synthetic QA pairs at scale from electronic health records. XAIQA uses a text classification explainer to identify important sentences in medical documents that are predictive of medical codes/conditions, and converts these into QA pairs. Key benefits highlighted in the paper are:

1) Scale - XAIQA can generate large volumes of QA pairs from medical documents and codes. 

2) Groundedness - The answers come from real text in the medical documents rather than being abstractive. 

3) Ability to produce non-keyword matches between questions and answers, capturing more semantic and complex relationships.

The paper demonstrates through expert evaluation that XAIQA generates more semantically complex and clinically abbreviated QA pairs compared to sentence transformer baselines. It also shows statistically significant improvements in QA performance of large language models like GPT-4 when provided XAIQA examples, especially on difficult questions.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Extractive question answering (QA) systems can enable searching medical records, but building these systems requires expert-annotated QA pairs which are costly and limited in scope. 
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can do extractive QA via in-context learning, but require high quality, in-domain examples tailored to the application.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce XAIQA, a novel method to generate synthetic QA pairs at scale from electronic health records by exploiting the symmetry between QA and explaining document classifiers.
- XAIQA uses a classifier's explanations to form questions from medical codes and grounded answers from predictive sentences. This enables creating many QA pairs without human annotation.

Key Contributions:
- XAIQA produces more semantically complex QA pairs than baselines, with 2.2x more semantic matches and 3.8x more abbreviations based on physician review.
- Adding XAIQA's QA pairs to GPT-4 prompts improves performance on extractive QA, especially on hard questions, with ~5% higher ROUGE score. 
- XAIQA can turn any labeled document collection into an extractive QA dataset with scale, grounding, and complexity.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach called XAIQA to automatically create synthetic yet high quality QA pairs from medical documents. XAIQA outperforms baselines in producing complex questions and answers. When used to augment models like GPT-4, it improves performance on extractive QA for medical text.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing XAIQA, a novel method to generate synthetic QA pairs at scale from electronic health records by using a classification model explainer. The key benefits highlighted are:

1) Scale - XAIQA can generate QA pairs for as many document-code pairs as exist in the EHR without need for human annotation.

2) Groundedness - The answer spans come from real medical document text rather than being abstractive.
