# [XAIQA: Explainer-Based Data Augmentation for Extractive Question   Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03567)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces XAIQA, a novel method for generating synthetic question-answer pairs from electronic health records to augment training data for extractive question answering models. XAIQA leverages model explainability techniques to identify important sentences from medical documents that serve as grounded answers to questions about medical concepts. In an expert evaluation, XAIQA generated question-answer pairs exhibited greater semantic complexity and more clinical abbreviations compared to pairs generated using sentence encoders. When provided as few-shot examples to the GPT-4 language model for extractive QA, XAIQA pairs improved performance over zero-shot and sentence encoder baselines, especially on difficult questions with low keyword overlap. The paper demonstrates XAIQA's ability to uncover grounded yet non-obvious relationships between questions and answers for improving QA models. Key advantages are the method's scalability, its avoidance of abstractive answers, and introduction of clinical semantic matches between questions and answers beyond lexical similarity.
