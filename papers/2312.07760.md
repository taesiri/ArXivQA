# [XC-NAS: A New Cellular Encoding Approach for Neural Architecture Search   of Multi-path Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Designing high-performing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks like image and text classification is challenging and requires substantial expert effort and time. 
- Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate the design of complex CNN architectures to mitigate this issue. 
- Existing NAS methods have limitations in only searching one domain (image or text), only partially exploring the search space, focusing just on micro-architectures, or being computationally expensive.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new cellular encoding (CE) representation called XC and a new NAS algorithm called XC-NAS. 
- XC can represent complex multi-path CNN architectures for both image and text tasks. It can dynamically adjust the depth and width of architectures during evolution.
- XC-NAS evolves XC-encoded architectures using genetic programming, evaluating on a subset of data to be efficient.
- Three XC-NAS variants are proposed using different micro-architecture blocks: Simple, ResNet-like, Inception-like.

Main Contributions:
- New XC representation for encoding complex multi-path CNN architectures with dynamic depth/width adjustment
- XC-NAS algorithm for efficiently searching the architecture space using XC representation 
- Demonstration of XC-NAS generalizing across image and text tasks
- Competitive results compared to state-of-the-art NAS methods on 5 datasets while using less than 1 GPU day
- Shows promise of XC and XC-NAS for automatically designing performant CNNs across domains

In summary, the paper introduces a new CE encoding and NAS method to efficiently evolve complex CNNs for multiple domains, demonstrating generalizability and state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new configurable cellular encoding representation and algorithm (XC-NAS) to efficiently evolve novel multi-path convolutional neural network architectures for image and text classification that achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A new configurable Cellular Encoding (CE) representation called XC that is designed to represent multi-pathed CNN architectures for image or text classification tasks. This representation has the ability to dynamically adjust the width and depth of the architecture during construction.

2. Three new ECNAS algorithms using the XC representation to evolve multi-path CNN architectures, each using a different handcrafted micro-architecture (simple convolutional block, ResNet block, or Inception module). These algorithms can evolve architectures for image or text classification in less than one GPU day.

So in summary, the main contributions are a new CE representation (XC) that can evolve complex multi-path CNNs with adjustable width and depth, along with three specific ECNAS algorithms implementing this representation to efficiently search the architecture space. The key ideas are the XC encoding scheme and showing it can work well across both image and text domains.
