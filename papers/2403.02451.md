# [Views Are My Own, But Also Yours: Benchmarking Theory of Mind using   Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02451)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the "theory of mind" (ToM) capabilities of language models is important for understanding how well they can model human cognition and conversation. 
- Many existing ToM benchmarks rely on synthetic, template-generated data which may not accurately reflect real human behavior and allows models to exploit spurious cues.

Proposed Solution:  
- The authors introduce the first ToM benchmark, "CommonToM", based on real spoken dialogs annotated for common ground. 
- They explicitly model agents' beliefs and common ground over the course of natural conversations to better capture ToM reasoning.

Key Contributions:
- Release of CommonToM, the first ToM corpus grounded in naturally occurring dialogs rather than synthetic stories.
- Demonstrating that large language models still struggle on CommonToM despite recent progress, showing room for improvement.
- Proposing an explicit neuro-symbolic model, ReCoG, that represents cognitive states and outperforms LMs on CommonToM by a large margin.

In summary, this paper makes an important contribution towards better evaluation of ToM in language models by using natural dialogs. The results show current LMs lack a true understanding of beliefs and common ground. Explicitly modeling these allows more accurate ToM reasoning, as shown by the ReCoG system substantially outperforming LMs on CommonToM.
