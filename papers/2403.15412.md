# [Towards Measuring and Modeling "Culture" in LLMs: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15412)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a survey of 39 recent papers that study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models (LLMs). It observes that none of the surveyed papers actually define "culture", which is a complex and multifaceted concept. Instead, the papers probe LLMs on specially designed datasets that represent certain aspects or "proxies" of culture. 

The paper categorizes these proxies into two main groups - semantic proxies like emotions, values, food, etc. that are influenced by culture, and demographic proxies like region, language, gender, etc. that define cultural groups. It also uses a 3-dimensional framework of linguistic-culture interactions involving aboutness, common ground and objectives/values.

Based on the analysis, the paper finds that most studies have focused only on certain proxies like values and norms, leaving many other aspects like topic relevance (aboutness) unexplored. It also finds issues with the reliability of the black-box probing methods used.

The paper then discusses several gaps - lack of a coherent framework and limited exploration of culture facets; lack of robustness and interpretability of methods; lack of interdisciplinarity and situatedness limiting practical validity.

It provides recommendations like explicitly defining culture proxies in studies, creating datasets covering diverse semantic domains, using white-box methods, conducting interdisciplinary and situated studies of real-world applications, and building multilingual datasets.

In conclusion, the paper provides useful taxonomies and analysis highlighting the limitations of current approaches, and lays out recommendations for a more holistic research agenda for studying and improving cultural representation in LLMs.
