# [Tell Your Model Where to Attend: Post-hoc Attention Steering for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02262)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a method called PASTA for steering the attention of large language models to user-specified parts of the input text during inference without changing the model parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper introduces PASTA (Post-hoc Attention Steering Approach), a method that allows users to highlight important parts of an input text to large language models (LLMs) during inference. PASTA identifies a small subset of attention heads in a trained LLM and applies attention reweighting to those heads, emphasizing user-specified spans. This guides the LLM to focus on those spans, similar to how human readers are guided by textual cues like bolding and italics. PASTA is applied after training and does not change model parameters. The authors introduce an efficient multi-task profiling algorithm to identify effective attention heads for steering. Experiments on diverse tasks demonstrate PASTA's ability to enhance LLMs' performance on instruction following, interpreting lengthy contexts, and resolving factual conflicts. For example, PASTA achieves an average 22% accuracy improvement over few-shot prompting on 4 tasks for LLAMA-7B. The results show PASTA's potential to improve LLMs' contextual understanding through user-guided attention steering.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper introduces PASTA, a method that allows users to highlight specific parts of the input text to large language models (LLMs) in order to steer the model's attention and focus during text generation. PASTA modifies the attention scores of select attention heads in the LLM during inference, emphasizing attention on user-specified tokens. A model profiling technique is used to identify the most effective attention heads to modify. Experiments demonstrate that PASTA improves LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions, interpret lengthy contexts, and resolve factual inconsistencies. The method is applied after model training and does not require changing model parameters. Results show PASTA substantially outperforms standard prompting baselines across diverse tasks, improving performance in following instructions, reasoning with long contexts, and overcoming knowledge conflicts. The work introduces a novel human-AI interaction approach complementary to existing methods like prompting, which enables users to guide LLMs more precisely.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop methods to steer the attention of large language models in a way that improves their ability to follow instructions and incorporate user-specified information?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Large language models struggle to follow complex instructions and integrate new knowledge from user inputs. This is because their learned attention mechanisms have difficulty focusing on the most crucial parts of long and complex prompts.

2) Modifying the attention scores of certain heads in the attention module can effectively steer the model's focus towards user-specified information. This is inspired by findings that different attention heads encode diverse semantic/syntactic roles.

3) An efficient model profiling method can identify the subset of attention heads that are most amenable to steering for improved performance. Steering only these heads will guide models without interfering with other functionality.

4) Applying attention steering only during inference (not changing model weights) will enhance model performance on following instructions and user-specified knowledge without compromising generalization ability.

In summary, the central research question is how to steer LLMs' attention, and the key hypothesis is that attention steering on select heads can enhance performance on tasks requiring instruction following and user guidance. The proposed PASTA method aims to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing PASTA (Post-hoc Attention Steering Approach), a method that allows users to highlight specific parts of the input text to large language models (LLMs) during inference. PASTA modifies the attention scores of selected heads in the LLM's attention module to emphasize user-specified spans, directing the model's focus similar to how human readers use textual cues like bolding and italics. The key aspects of PASTA are:

- It is a post-hoc method applied only during inference, without changing model parameters.

- It introduces an efficient multi-task profiling algorithm to identify effective attention heads for steering each LLM. 

- Experiments show PASTA significantly improves LLMs' ability to follow instructions, interpret lengthy contexts, and resolve knowledge conflicts, outperforming standard prompting strategies.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing PASTA as a novel way to steer LLMs' attention and bias their generation towards user-specified input parts, without retraining models. The paper demonstrates this can enhance model performance on a variety of tasks by directing attention based on user guidance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on the provided information, here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- The paper presents a novel method called PASTA for steering the attention of large language models (LLMs) during inference to align their outputs with user-specified emphasis in the prompt. This approach of controlling LLMs through attention manipulation is relatively new and addresses important limitations with existing prompting methods. 

- Prior work on adapting LLMs has focused more on prompting strategies or model fine-tuning. PASTA offers a lightweight alternative that does not require updating model weights. The idea of leveraging attention mechanisms to guide LLMs is novel and shows promise based on the results.

- The paper introduces an efficient model profiling technique to identify the most effective attention heads for steering. This helps avoid negative impacts from modifying the wrong heads. Profiling attention heads is an interesting idea that could have broader applications beyond this specific method.

- Experiments demonstrate that PASTA provides substantial improvements over baselines in following instructions, interpreting contexts, and resolving knowledge conflicts. The consistent gains across diverse tasks highlight the usefulness of this approach.

- Compared to related model editing techniques like ROME and MEND, PASTA preserves more of the original model's transfer learning abilities. The post-hoc attention steering is gentler than directly modifying parameters or embeddings.

- The idea of allowing users to indicate emphasis similarly to bold/italic text is intuitive. This capability would be valuable for human-AI interfaces. Overall, PASTA offers a novel way to direct LLMs that complements existing methods.

In summary, this paper introduces a promising approach for controlling LLMs through selective attention manipulation. The experiments show substantial gains over baseline prompting methods on a variety of tasks. The model profiling technique and ability to leverage text emphasis are interesting contributions to the field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing methods to automatically identify the most effective attention heads to steer for a given task, rather than requiring manual profiling. The authors suggest exploring techniques like meta-learning for this.

- Studying how to dynamically determine the amount of emphasis to apply when steering attention, rather than using a fixed coefficient. This could help balance efficacy and fluency.

- Extending PASTA to other model architectures beyond transformers, like CNNs and RNNs, by identifying components analogous to attention heads that can be steered.

- Combining PASTA with few-shot prompting or other techniques to further enhance contextual understanding and follow complex instructions.

- Evaluating PASTA on a wider range of tasks and model sizes to better understand its capabilities and limits.

- Exploring variations of the attention re-weighting scheme, like using soft masks instead of scaling scores.

- Developing theoretical understandings of when and why steering attention is most effective for conveying emphasis.

So in summary, the main directions are developing more automated and adaptive ways to select heads and determine emphasis, extending PASTA to other architectures, combining it with complementary methods, evaluating it more extensively, and further improving the attention steering methodology. Developing theory is also highlighted as an important direction for future work.

4. The paper focuses on steering self-attention in the transformer architecture. Could similar attention steering approaches be applied to other attention mechanisms like cross-attention? Would it be as effective?

5. The paper emphasizes steering a small subset of attention heads. How does the performance change if more attention heads are steered? Is there a sweet spot for the number of steered heads?

6. How does the approach compare to other methods for controlling or steering LLMs like prompting, instruction tuning, etc.? In what scenarios would this approach be preferable or not recommended?

7. The paper evaluates the approach on a few large LLMs. How well does the approach apply to smaller or distilled LLMs? Do the same attention heads remain effective for steering?

8. The paper demonstrates steering on input text spans. Could the approach be extended to emphasize other modalities like images, audio, etc. that are part of multimodal inputs?

9. The paper focuses on steering attention at lower layers closest to the input. How does steering attention at higher layers affect the model behavior and generations?

10. The paper emphasizes user-specified text spans. Could the approach be modified to de-emphasize or reduce attention on certain spans to prevent models from focusing on unwanted information?
