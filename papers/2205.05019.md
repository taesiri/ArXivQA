## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research questions/hypotheses of this paper are:1) Can VideoQA models be trained effectively without large amounts of manually annotated visual data by instead leveraging large amounts of readily available narrated video data? 2) Can strong zero-shot VideoQA performance be achieved by pretraining a model on automatically generated VideoQA data and then evaluating it on unseen target datasets without any finetuning on those target datasets?3) How does pretraining a VideoQA model on automatically generated data compare to pretraining on other large video-text datasets without QA annotations or transferring from existing manually annotated VQA datasets? 4) Does the proposed automatic VideoQA dataset generation approach generalize to different sources of web video data beyond just narrated instructional videos?5) Does the introduction of a new manually annotated VideoQA benchmark with multiple answers per question and reduced language bias provide additional insights for VideoQA research?In summary, the key goals seem to be 1) proposing a scalable approach to VideoQA training without manual annotation, 2) demonstrating strong zero-shot transfer, 3) benchmarking against other pretraining strategies, 4) showing generalization to different web video data, and 5) introducing a new challenging VideoQA benchmark.

## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the main points from the paper:The paper proposes an approach to automatically generate large-scale training data for video question answering by leveraging language models and cross-modal supervision from readily available narrated videos or videos with alt-text, trains a multi-modal videoQA model on this data via contrastive learning, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization as well as competitive results when finetuned on existing VQA datasets.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in video question answering:- Dataset scale: This paper introduces two large-scale automatically generated datasets - HowToVQA69M with 69M video-question-answer triplets, and WebVidVQA3M with 3.5M triplets. These are orders of magnitude larger than previous VideoQA datasets, which have typically been limited to hundreds of thousands of samples due to the expense of manual annotation. The large scale of these datasets allows the authors' model to be pretrained in a task-specific manner.- Learning framework: The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to directly model open-ended answers instead of casting VideoQA as a classification problem over a fixed set of possible answers. This allows their model to handle the full diversity of free-form answers in the large-scale datasets. Other recent works have typically reduced VideoQA to a classification problem with a limited output space.- Generalization: The paper demonstrates strong generalization through zero-shot evaluation to unseen datasets and a VideoQA feature probe evaluation setting. Most prior works have focused on supervised finetuning and evaluation on existing benchmarks. The zero-shot and feature probe settings better evaluate how well the models generalize.- Data source: The datasets are generated automatically from web videos with readily available narrations and alt-text, rather than expensive manual annotations. Using alternative sources of inexpensive supervision for pretraining is an important direction for scaling up VideoQA.- Model architecture: The paper uses a dual transformer architecture with joint video-question and answer encoders. Other recent works have explored different architectures like recurrent networks or graph neural networks. The transformer allows implicitly modeling temporal structure.Overall, the large-scale datasets, contrastive learning framework, generalization evaluation, and use of weak supervision point to promising research directions for advancing VideoQA. The model architecture is also representative of the trend toward transformers for multimodal tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Scaling up the amount of training data even further. The authors note that their results show scale is an important factor, and pretraining on larger amounts of data leads to improved performance. They suggest generating even larger VideoQA datasets or combining data from multiple sources.- Adapting the approach to other domains beyond instructional videos. The method could potentially be applied to other types of videos with different forms of annotations or descriptions. Exploring other domains could further demonstrate the generalizability.- Investigating other model architectures and self-supervised objectives for pretraining. While the authors used a contrastive learning objective, other proxy tasks may be explored. The transformer architecture could also be altered or expanded.- Reducing language bias and reliance on corpus artifacts. While manually reducing bias for iVQA, there are opportunities to do this automatically during data generation. The language models could also be adapted to minimize exploiting dataset biases. - Moving beyond a fixed vocabulary of answers at test time. The joint embedding approach could enable an open vocabulary at test time too.- Developing better automatic metrics for evaluating open-ended VideoQA. Manual evaluation was needed for analysis, suggesting improved automatic metrics would be useful.- Exploring semi-supervised or weakly supervised techniques to supplement the generated data with a small amount of labeled real videos.So in summary, the main directions are developing larger and better VideoQA datasets, improving the models and pretraining techniques, reducing biases, and creating better evaluation methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper presents a method for automatically generating large-scale training data for video question answering without the need for manual annotation. The authors leverage cross-modal supervision and text-only transformers trained for question generation to create question-answer pairs from the narrations of instructional videos. They use this approach to generate a dataset called HowToVQA69M with over 69 million video-question-answer triplets from the HowTo100M dataset. To handle the open-ended nature of the questions and answers, they train a multi-modal transformer model using a contrastive loss between joined video-question and answer embeddings. They show their model achieves strong zero-shot performance by using no manually annotated visual data during training, outperforming models pretrained on other text-video datasets like HowTo100M. Their model also achieves competitive results when finetuned on existing VideoQA datasets like MSRVTT-QA and ActivityNet-QA. The authors argue their approach is highly scalable by generating additional data and can be applied to other sources of web video. They also introduce a new manually annotated evaluation dataset called iVQA focused on visual reasoning.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper proposes an approach to automatically generate large-scale training data for video question answering (VideoQA) without manual annotation. The authors leverage readily available narrated videos and transform the speech transcripts into question-answer pairs using trained language models. Specifically, they use transformers to extract answers from transcript sentences and generate corresponding questions. Applying this method to 1.2M HowTo100M instructional videos generates the HowToVQA69M dataset with over 69 million diverse video-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of answers, they train a multi-modal transformer model using contrastive learning between (video, question) and answer embeddings. Their model shows strong zero-shot VideoQA performance and competitive results when finetuned on existing datasets like MSRVTT-QA, MSVD-QA and How2QA. The approach also generalizes to other web video datasets by creating the WebVidVQA3M dataset from video-alt-text pairs.Additionally, the authors introduce a new benchmark called iVQA with manually annotated questions and multiple answers per video clip to reduce language bias. Analysis shows the visual modality is more important in iVQA compared to prior datasets. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective approach to generate large-scale VideoQA training data from readily available web videos and text. The proposed model leverages the scale and diversity of the generated datasets to achieve strong generalization and handle the open vocabulary of answers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper introduces an approach to automatically generate large-scale training data for video question answering (VideoQA) without requiring manual annotation. The key idea is to leverage readily available narrated videos along with transformer models pre-trained on text-only question answering data. Specifically, the authors first train a question generation model and an answer extraction model on a text QA dataset. They then apply these models to the transcripts of narrated instructional videos from the HowTo100M dataset to automatically generate QA pairs about the content of the videos. Each video is temporally aligned to sentences from its transcript, and QA pairs are produced for each sentence. In this way, the authors are able to automatically produce the large-scale HowToVQA69M dataset containing over 69 million diverse video-question-answer triplets for training VideoQA models, without needing any manual annotation of the visual data.
