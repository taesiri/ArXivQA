# [Zolly: Zoom Focal Length Correctly for Perspective-Distorted Human Mesh   Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13796)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How can we improve 3D human mesh reconstruction from single RGB images that contain perspective distortion due to the camera being close to the human subject?The authors identify that existing methods for monocular 3D human mesh reconstruction either use a fixed large focal length or estimate the focal length based on background context. However, these approaches fail to properly handle images with perspective distortion caused by the camera being close to the subject. To address this issue, the paper proposes a new method called ZOLLY that focuses specifically on reconstructing human meshes from perspective-distorted images. The core ideas are:1) Analyzing the cause of perspective distortion and finding it's mainly due to the relative position between the camera center and human body.2) Proposing a new camera model and 2D representation called "distortion image" to capture the distortion scale. 3) Estimating the camera-to-body distance from the distortion scale instead of using background context.4) Using both perspective and weak perspective projection losses to formulate the correct projection matrix and locate the human body.5) Introducing a new synthetic dataset called PDHuman and extending two real datasets to provide perspective-distorted images for training and evaluation.The central hypothesis is that by focusing specifically on modeling perspective distortion through these ideas, the method can better reconstruct human meshes from images where the camera is close to the subject. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on perspective-distorted datasets.In summary, the key research question is how to do monocular 3D human mesh reconstruction for images with perspective distortion, and the central hypothesis is modeling the distortion itself can lead to better performance. The paper proposes a novel method and datasets to address this problem.
