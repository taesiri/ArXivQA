# [SusFL: Energy-Aware Federated Learning-based Monitoring for Sustainable   Smart Farms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10280)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of inconsistent health monitoring in smart farms due to fluctuating energy levels of solar-powered sensors. As smart farms rely on solar sensors to monitor livestock health, variability in sunlight exposure impacts the sensors' ability to gather and transmit data for analysis. This threatens the reliability and sustainability of health monitoring systems.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an energy-aware federated learning (FL) system called "SusFL" to optimize monitoring quality while ensuring sustainability of solar sensors. The key ideas are:

1) Equip livestock (e.g. cows) with solar-powered sensors and Raspberry Pis to collect health data and train local ML models. These "clients" periodically transmit updates to gateways.

2) Incorporate mechanism design theory to intelligently select clients for federated learning. This considers factors like sensor energy levels and data quality to balance monitoring performance and energy efficiency.

3) Employ a hierarchical FL architecture with edge server aggregation between clients and the cloud server. This reduces communication overhead.

4) Use weighted parameter aggregation focused on high-quality local updates to improve the global model's prediction accuracy.

Main Contributions:

1) Sustainable client selection approach via mechanism design that enhances system longevity and addresses fluctuating energy levels of solar sensors.

2) First application of federated learning for animal disease detection in smart farms, using real-world livestock health datasets.

3) Evaluation of prediction accuracy alongside operational metrics like energy consumption, system availability, and resilience to attacks.

4) Demonstrated superior performance of SusFL system against benchmark schemes, with 10% less energy use, 15% higher social welfare, 34% increased system reliability, and marginally better prediction accuracy.

In summary, the paper pioneers a specialized federated learning system to enable reliable and sustainable health monitoring for smart farms using solar-powered sensors. A combination of hierarchical federated learning, optimized client selection, and weighted parameter aggregation provides robustness and efficiency gains.
