# [KnowledgeNavigator: Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced   Reasoning over Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) suffer from knowledge limitations including outdated knowledge, factual errors, and lack of domain knowledge. This limits their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks requiring long logical reasoning chains.

- Knowledge graphs contain structured real-world knowledge but are difficult for LLMs to reason over directly due to their triple format. 

- Challenges in using knowledge graphs to enhance LLMs include efficiently filtering irrelevant knowledge, exponential growth of multi-hop search, and representing knowledge in a way LLMs can understand.

Proposed Solution:
- A framework called KnowledgeNavigator that enhances LLM reasoning by efficiently retrieving relevant external knowledge from knowledge graphs and converting it into an effective prompt.

- It has 3 stages - Question Analysis, Knowledge Retrieval, and Reasoning.

- Question Analysis predicts number of reasoning hops needed and generates similar questions. 

- Knowledge Retrieval iteratively searches knowledge graph guided by LLM on relevant entities/relations and extracts a reasoning subgraph.

- Reasoning stage aggregates retrieved triples to reduce redundancy then converts them to natural language for the LLM prompt.

Main Contributions:
- A novel general framework to address knowledge limitation in LLMs using knowledge graphs as external knowledge source to enhance reasoning.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other LLM frameworks on KGQA datasets and is comparable to fully supervised models.

- Demonstrates effectiveness of each component through ablation studies.

- Can support any knowledge graph and LLM through modular design.

In summary, KnowledgeNavigator leverages knowledge graphs to overcome knowledge limitations of LLMs for complex reasoning tasks by efficiently extracting relevant external knowledge and representing it in a way tailored for the LLM. The framework's strong performance highlights the promise of using external structured knowledge sources to enhance large language model capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes KnowledgeNavigator, a novel framework to enhance large language model reasoning over knowledge graphs for question answering by iteratively retrieving relevant knowledge to construct effective prompts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework called KnowledgeNavigator to address the knowledge limitation and reasoning challenges of large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) KnowledgeNavigator enhances LLM reasoning and question answering ability on knowledge graph QA (KGQA) tasks. It efficiently retrieves external knowledge from knowledge graphs to compensate for LLM's lack of knowledge. 

2) KnowledgeNavigator contains three key stages - Question Analysis, Knowledge Retrieval, and Reasoning. It analyzes the question, iteratively retrieves relevant knowledge from the knowledge graph, and converts the retrieved knowledge into effective prompts to feed the LLM.

3) Extensive experiments show KnowledgeNavigator outperforms previous knowledge graph enhanced LLM methods and achieves comparable performance to fully supervised models on benchmark KGQA datasets. This demonstrates its effectiveness.

4) Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component of KnowledgeNavigator. Error analysis provides insights into future improvements.

In summary, the main contribution is using knowledge graphs to enhance LLM reasoning and performance on KGQA tasks through an efficient retrieval and prompting framework KnowledgeNavigator.
