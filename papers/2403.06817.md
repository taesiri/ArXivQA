# [Are Targeted Messages More Effective?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies two versions of graph neural networks (GNNs) - 1-sided GNNs (1-GNNs) where messages passed between nodes depend only on the source node state, and 2-sided GNNs (2-GNNs) where messages depend on the states of both the source and target nodes. The key question studied is whether 2-GNNs are more expressive than 1-GNNs in terms of the computational power and functions they can represent.

The problem is motivated by the fact that both 1-GNNs and 2-GNNs are used in practice, with a perception that 2-GNNs are more powerful, but limited theoretical understanding of their relative expressivity. The study also connects to distinguishing two logical fragments - modal and guarded fragments - of first-order logic with counting.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. The paper proves that in the uniform setting, there exists a query computable by a 2-GNN that cannot be computed by any 1-GNN. This is true for GNNs using SUM aggregation and establishes that 2-GNNs are strictly more expressive.

2. For non-uniform expressivity, where GNNs can vary with input size, the paper leverages known logical characterizations to show that 1-GNNs and 2-GNNs have equivalent power. This holds even for polynomial-size, bounded-depth GNN families. 

3. A main technical contribution is a proof that the modal and guarded fragments of first-order logic with counting have equivalent expressivity over undirected graphs. This implies the equivalence between 1-GNNs and 2-GNNs in non-uniform settings. The proof uses novel ideas like hashing sets to signatures.

4. For GNNs using MAX or MEAN aggregation, the paper shows 1-GNNs can simulate 2-GNNs, proving equivalent expressivity.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive study of the expressivity of 1-GNNs versus 2-GNNs, in both uniform and non-uniform settings, using logical tools. The results reveal a nuanced picture of their relationship and multiple technical contributions towards separating or equating their power.
