# [Segment Anything Model-guided Collaborative Learning Network for   Scribble-supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00312)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SAM-CLNet, a novel framework for weakly-supervised polyp segmentation that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost performance. The core of SAM-CLNet is the Cross-level Enhancement and Aggregation Network (CEA-Net), which effectively integrates multi-level encoder features through the proposed Cross-level Enhancement Module (CEM) and Feature Aggregation Module (FAM). CEA-Net segmentation maps are combined with scribble annotations to generate precise prompts for SAM to produce additional supervision masks. A box-augmentation strategy and image-level filtering mechanism further enhance prompt quality and mask reliability. Through collaborative online fine-tuning of both CEA-Net and SAM, the framework facilitates mutual improvements. Experiments on scribble-annotated colonoscopy datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with key advantages being more precise segmentation, intact capture of targets, and robustness against challenges like blurry boundaries and size variations. The method significantly advances weakly-supervised medical segmentation by capitalizing on recent vision foundation model breakthroughs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes SAM-CLNet, a collaborative learning framework between a cross-level enhancement and aggregation network (CEA-Net) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost performance for weakly-supervised polyp segmentation using scribble annotations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel SAM-guided Collaborative Learning Network (SAM-CLNet) framework for scribble-supervised polyp segmentation. This framework enables collaborative learning between the segmentation network (CEA-Net) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve performance. 

2) It presents CEA-Net, which consists of a Cross-level Enhancement Module (CEM) to integrate adjacent features and a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to aggregate multi-level features. These modules capture richer representations to boost segmentation accuracy.

3) It introduces a strategy to generate prompts by combining segmentation maps from CEA-Net and scribble annotations. These precise prompts are fed into SAM to produce additional supervision signals (SAM-guided masks). It also proposes a box-augmentation method and filtering mechanism.

4) It demonstrates superior performance of the proposed SAM-CLNet over other state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods on scribble annotated polyp datasets. The collaborative learning between CEA-Net and SAM is shown to be effective.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel SAM-CLNet framework that enables collaborative learning to improve weakly-supervised polyp segmentation using only scribble annotations.
