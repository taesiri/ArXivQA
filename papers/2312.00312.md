## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SAM-CLNet, a novel framework for weakly-supervised polyp segmentation that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost performance. The core of SAM-CLNet is the Cross-level Enhancement and Aggregation Network (CEA-Net), which effectively integrates multi-level encoder features through the proposed Cross-level Enhancement Module (CEM) and Feature Aggregation Module (FAM). CEA-Net segmentation maps are combined with scribble annotations to generate precise prompts for SAM to produce additional supervision masks. A box-augmentation strategy and image-level filtering mechanism further enhance prompt quality and mask reliability. Through collaborative online fine-tuning of both CEA-Net and SAM, the framework facilitates mutual improvements. Experiments on scribble-annotated colonoscopy datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with key advantages being more precise segmentation, intact capture of targets, and robustness against challenges like blurry boundaries and size variations. The method significantly advances weakly-supervised medical segmentation by capitalizing on recent vision foundation model breakthroughs.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Fully-supervised deep learning methods for polyp segmentation require large amounts of pixel-level annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Weakly-supervised methods using only scribble annotations can alleviate this issue but face challenges in accurately segmenting polyps due to limited supervision.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel Segment Anything Model (SAM) guided Collaborative Learning Network (SAM-CLNet) for scribble-supervised polyp segmentation. The key components are:

1) Cross-level Enhancement and Aggregation Network (CEA-Net): A segmentation network with two key modules - Cross-level Enhancement Module (CEM) to integrate features from adjacent encoder layers, and Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to combine multi-level encoder features.

2) SAM-guided Mask Generation: Leverages SAM's ability to produce segmentation masks. Combines CEA-Net maps and scribble annotations to form better prompts for SAM to output reliable masks as extra supervision for CEA-Net. Also uses an image-level filtering mechanism to remove unreliable SAM masks.

3) Collaborative Learning Framework: Trains CEA-Net and fine-tunes SAM simultaneously in a collaborative manner so they can work synergistically.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first SAM-guided collaborative learning framework for weakly-supervised segmentation that allows CEA-Net and SAM to interact and jointly boost performance.

- Presents CEA-Net with CEM and FAM modules to effectively utilize cross-level features and generate high-quality maps from limited supervision.

- Introduces prompt engineering strategy and filtering mechanism to produce precise SAM-guided masks as supplementary labels to train CEA-Net.

- Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple colonoscopy datasets, demonstrating effectiveness for scribble-supervised polyp segmentation.
