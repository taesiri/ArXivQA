# [Leveraging Compressed Frame Sizes For Ultra-Fast Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08580)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional video classification methods rely on pixel-level features like color, texture, motion etc. which requires full decompression of videos. This leads to high computational and storage costs. Also, these methods struggle with low quality videos.

- With the immense volume of videos being uploaded constantly (e.g. YouTube, TikTok), there is a need for ultra-fast video classification methods that can scale. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method that classifies videos by examining only the compressed bitstream, eliminating the need for decoding. 

- The key idea is that factors like editing style, shot selection etc. manifest in the sequence of compressed frame sizes and bitrate variations when encoded by a rate-distortion optimized video encoder.

- A ResNet-based neural network is used to classify the time series of compressed frame sizes into categories like sports, music etc. without decoding the bitstream.

Main Contributions:
- Curated a large-scale dataset of 29,000+ YouTube clips spanning 11 categories, totaling over 6,000 hours.

- Achieved 80-90% precision, accuracy and recall using just the compressed bitstream, validating the core idea. 

- Operates 15,000x faster than real-time for 30fps videos, 7 orders of magnitude faster than standard DTW algorithm.

- Robust to variations in encoding settings like ABR/CBR, presence of B-frames etc. Can even work with encrypted bitstreams.

- Overall, demonstrated the feasibility of ultra-fast video classification without needing pixel-level decoding, with applications for large-scale video analytics.
