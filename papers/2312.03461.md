# [HiFi4G: High-Fidelity Human Performance Rendering via Compact Gaussian   Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03461)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents HiFi4G, a novel approach for high-fidelity 4D human performance rendering that combines implicit 3D Gaussian splatting with explicit non-rigid tracking. A key insight is marrying these complementary techniques to achieve a compact yet high-quality representation for immersive viewing experiences. Specifically, a dual-graph mechanism with coarse and fine-grained components is proposed to effectively initialize and constrain the 4D Gaussians. Further, spatial-temporal regularizers are introduced to balance tracking priors and appearance updating for consistent rendering quality. Optimized results are made practical through a compression scheme, requiring only 2MB per frame while retaining visual fidelity. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across optimization speed, rendering quality, and storage overhead. By bridging cutting-edge differentiable rendering with traditional tracking in an explicit and compact manner, HiFi4G delivers lifelike human performances suitable for platforms like VR headsets. Key strengths include expedited convergence, reduced memory footprint, and seamless GPU integration - making an important step towards next-generation immersive experiences.
