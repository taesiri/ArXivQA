# [HiFi4G: High-Fidelity Human Performance Rendering via Compact Gaussian   Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03461)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents HiFi4G, a novel approach for high-fidelity 4D human performance rendering that combines implicit 3D Gaussian splatting with explicit non-rigid tracking. A key insight is marrying these complementary techniques to achieve a compact yet high-quality representation for immersive viewing experiences. Specifically, a dual-graph mechanism with coarse and fine-grained components is proposed to effectively initialize and constrain the 4D Gaussians. Further, spatial-temporal regularizers are introduced to balance tracking priors and appearance updating for consistent rendering quality. Optimized results are made practical through a compression scheme, requiring only 2MB per frame while retaining visual fidelity. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across optimization speed, rendering quality, and storage overhead. By bridging cutting-edge differentiable rendering with traditional tracking in an explicit and compact manner, HiFi4G delivers lifelike human performances suitable for platforms like VR headsets. Key strengths include expedited convergence, reduced memory footprint, and seamless GPU integration - making an important step towards next-generation immersive experiences.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Efficiently rendering high-fidelity and realistic human performance for immersive experiences like VR/AR remains challenging. Prior works using meshes struggle with holes and noise. Neural rendering approaches produce blurry results lacking details. Explicit dynamic scene representations sacrifice quality for storage. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes HiFi4G, a compact Gaussian-based approach to achieve high-fidelity 4D human performance rendering from multi-view RGB videos. The key idea is marrying 3D Gaussian representation with non-rigid tracking to explicitly disentangle motion and appearance for a compact representation.

A dual-graph mechanism is introduced, consisting of:
1) A coarse deformation graph obtained via non-rigid tracking on per-frame geometry proxies. It establishes motion priors in a keyframe manner.  
2) A fine-grained Gaussian graph connecting Gaussians in space-time, initialized from the proxies and warped based on the deformation graph.

A 4D Gaussian optimization scheme with spatial-temporal regularizers is presented to balance the motion prior and Gaussian updating for consistency. It has: 
1) A temporal regularizer enforcing appearance coherence over time.  
2) A smoothness regularizer producing locally as-rigid-as-possible motion.
3) An adaptive weighting based on displacement to handle both static and dynamic regions.

For practical usage, a compression scheme based on residual compensation and entropy encoding is introduced, achieving high compression rate while maintaining quality.

Main Contributions:
1) A compact explicit Gaussian-based representation for high-fidelity 4D human performance rendering by combining splatting and tracking.
2) A dual-graph mechanism for disentangling motion and appearance with rich priors.
3) 4D Gaussian optimization with novel regularizers ensuring spatial-temporal consistency.  
4) A compression scheme enabling immersive viewing experiences with low storage overhead.

Experiments show superior performance over state-of-the-arts in terms of speed, quality and storage. The compact representation also allows seamless integration into GPU rasterization.
