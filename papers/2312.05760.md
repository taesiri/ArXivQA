# [RepViT-SAM: Towards Real-Time Segmenting Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive zero-shot transfer performance for various computer vision tasks. However, its heavy computation costs remain challenging for practical applications. MobileSAM replaces the heavy image encoder in SAM with TinyViT using distillation to reduce computational requirements. However, deployment of MobileSAM on resource-constrained mobile devices still encounters challenges due to substantial memory and computation overhead of self-attention. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes RepViT-SAM which replaces the image encoder in SAM with RepViT to achieve real-time segmenting anything on mobile devices. RepViT incorporates efficient architectural designs of ViTs into CNNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and latency trade-off on mobile devices. Similar to MobileSAM, RepViT-SAM is trained by distilling the RepViT image encoder from the ViT encoder in original SAM using an MSE loss.

Main Contributions:
1) Proposes RepViT-SAM which replaces heavyweight image encoder in SAM with RepViT to enable real-time inference on mobile devices
2) Achieves 10x faster inference than MobileSAM on MacBook while maintaining strong zero-shot transfer performance
3) Extensive experiments show superior transfer capability over MobileSAM on tasks like zero-shot edge detection, instance segmentation, video object/instance segmentation etc.
4) Qualitative results demonstrate RepViT-SAM generates high-quality mask predictions comparable to SAM where MobileSAM struggles

In summary, RepViT-SAM demonstrates outstanding efficiency along with impressive zero-shot transfer performance on various vision tasks, showcasing its potential for practical mobile applications.
