# [CodeCompose: A Large-Scale Industrial Deployment of AI-assisted Code   Authoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems the central research question this paper addresses is:What is the impact of deploying an AI-based coding assistant tool called CodeCompose at large scale across multiple programming languages within a large technology company?The authors built CodeCompose, an AI coding assistant that makes code suggestions to help developers with code authoring. They deployed it internally at Meta across 10+ programming languages and measured its impact through quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. The key findings were:- CodeCompose had an average acceptance rate of 22% for code suggestions across languages. - 8% of code typed by CodeCompose users came from accepting its suggestions.- Overwhelmingly positive reception - 91.5% of user feedback was favorable.- Helped accelerate coding and improved productivity.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that an AI coding assistant customized and deployed at scale within a large company can have a significant positive impact on code authoring, which the results validated. The paper details the process of building, deploying and evaluating CodeCompose to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The introduction and discussion of \cc, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed at \company. The authors describe the characteristics of \cc, including that it is multi-lingual, customized for \company, has natural language proficiency, and is bi-directional.2. A discussion of the unique challenges faced when deploying AI coding assistants at large companies like \company. This includes challenges around building trust, designing the user experience, and defining metrics. The authors share learnings from the \cc deployment that address these challenges.3. Details about the underlying large language model architecture that powers \cc, including a new training objective called Language Causal Masking that is tailored for code completion. An offline evaluation showed significant gains from fine-tuning on \company's internal code.4. A presentation of the system architecture for \cc, including the server, Language Server Protocol, and client components.5. Quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from a large-scale deployment of \cc at \company across 10+ programming languages. Key metrics show high acceptance rates and that a substantial percentage of code was generated through \cc. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive.In summary, the main contributions appear to be introducing \cc specifically, discussing challenges with deploying such systems at scale, providing implementation details, and presenting extensive evaluation results from a large-scale industrial deployment. The paper seems to focus on the experience building and deploying this tool at \company.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper presents CodeCompose, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed at Meta that leverages large language models to provide inline code suggestions to developers. It discusses challenges in deploying such tools at scale, the system design, and results from a large-scale deployment showing high developer acceptance and positive impact on code authoring.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper comparing to other research on AI-based coding assistants:- The focus on challenges and considerations of large-scale deployment in an industrial setting makes it fairly unique. Most prior work has focused on offline evaluations or small studies rather than a full production deployment. - The scale of the deployment described here in terms of number of developers, languages, and codebase size seems larger than previous work from companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.- The use of the bi-directional InCoder model architecture customized with the LCM training objective is a novel contribution compared to prior work.- The analysis of both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback provides a more comprehensive picture than just focusing on one or the other.- The discussion of building trust, optimizing user experience, and developing suitable metrics are practical contributions that provide guidance for future deployments. - However, this work is limited to one company so the generalizability is unclear. The productivity impact is also not directly measured.- Overall, this seems like an advance in demonstrating the feasibility and value of AI coding assistants in large real-world software development. But more open research is still needed to understand how well these results generalize.In summary, the scale and comprehensiveness of this deployment study advances the state-of-the-art, but there are still open questions regarding generalizability that future research in this rapidly evolving field will need to address. The focus on practical deployment issues is a useful contribution for guiding real-world adoption.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest include:- Performing a more comprehensive evaluation of CodeCompose using the SPACE framework. This includes analyzing metrics like diffs per developer per month, diff authoring time, etc. to better understand productivity impact.- Creating a telemetry pipeline and funnel to log fine-grained events during the lifecycle of a CodeCompose request. This can help measure metrics like precision and recall accurately. - Enabling more advanced features in CodeCompose like block completions, conversational interactions, and code explanation capabilities.- Expanding the application of CodeCompose beyond code authoring to assist developers throughout the software development lifecycle.- Leveraging semantic information via pre and post-processing to improve suggestion accuracy and reduce hallucinations.- Conducting more rigorous studies to evaluate the impact of CodeCompose on developer productivity with statistical significance. The current work mostly focuses on usage metrics and feedback.- Testing the generalizability of CodeCompose by deploying and evaluating similar systems outside of Meta. The results may vary across organizations.- Exploring human factors like typing behaviors, acceptance criteria, and UX preferences in using AI coding assistants through user studies.In summary, the authors propose enhancements to CodeCompose itself, rigorously measuring its impact, reducing model limitations, expanding its applications, and testing its generalizability as interesting future directions.
