# [CodeCompose: A Large-Scale Industrial Deployment of AI-assisted Code   Authoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems the central research question this paper addresses is:What is the impact of deploying an AI-based coding assistant tool called CodeCompose at large scale across multiple programming languages within a large technology company?The authors built CodeCompose, an AI coding assistant that makes code suggestions to help developers with code authoring. They deployed it internally at Meta across 10+ programming languages and measured its impact through quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. The key findings were:- CodeCompose had an average acceptance rate of 22% for code suggestions across languages. - 8% of code typed by CodeCompose users came from accepting its suggestions.- Overwhelmingly positive reception - 91.5% of user feedback was favorable.- Helped accelerate coding and improved productivity.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that an AI coding assistant customized and deployed at scale within a large company can have a significant positive impact on code authoring, which the results validated. The paper details the process of building, deploying and evaluating CodeCompose to demonstrate this.
