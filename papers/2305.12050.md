# [CodeCompose: A Large-Scale Industrial Deployment of AI-assisted Code   Authoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12050)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, it seems the central research question this paper addresses is:What is the impact of deploying an AI-based coding assistant tool called CodeCompose at large scale across multiple programming languages within a large technology company?The authors built CodeCompose, an AI coding assistant that makes code suggestions to help developers with code authoring. They deployed it internally at Meta across 10+ programming languages and measured its impact through quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. The key findings were:- CodeCompose had an average acceptance rate of 22% for code suggestions across languages. - 8% of code typed by CodeCompose users came from accepting its suggestions.- Overwhelmingly positive reception - 91.5% of user feedback was favorable.- Helped accelerate coding and improved productivity.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that an AI coding assistant customized and deployed at scale within a large company can have a significant positive impact on code authoring, which the results validated. The paper details the process of building, deploying and evaluating CodeCompose to demonstrate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. The introduction and discussion of \cc, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed at \company. The authors describe the characteristics of \cc, including that it is multi-lingual, customized for \company, has natural language proficiency, and is bi-directional.2. A discussion of the unique challenges faced when deploying AI coding assistants at large companies like \company. This includes challenges around building trust, designing the user experience, and defining metrics. The authors share learnings from the \cc deployment that address these challenges.3. Details about the underlying large language model architecture that powers \cc, including a new training objective called Language Causal Masking that is tailored for code completion. An offline evaluation showed significant gains from fine-tuning on \company's internal code.4. A presentation of the system architecture for \cc, including the server, Language Server Protocol, and client components.5. Quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from a large-scale deployment of \cc at \company across 10+ programming languages. Key metrics show high acceptance rates and that a substantial percentage of code was generated through \cc. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive.In summary, the main contributions appear to be introducing \cc specifically, discussing challenges with deploying such systems at scale, providing implementation details, and presenting extensive evaluation results from a large-scale industrial deployment. The paper seems to focus on the experience building and deploying this tool at \company.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper presents CodeCompose, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed at Meta that leverages large language models to provide inline code suggestions to developers. It discusses challenges in deploying such tools at scale, the system design, and results from a large-scale deployment showing high developer acceptance and positive impact on code authoring.
