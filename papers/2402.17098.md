# [In Defense and Revival of Bayesian Filtering for Thermal Infrared Object   Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17098)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Thermal infrared (TIR) object tracking is crucial for applications like surveillance, unmanned vehicles etc. But faces challenges in complex scenarios like target deformation, occlusion, background clutter etc.
- Existing methods rely solely on infrared data and have limitations. Updating strategies are either static or can cause tracking drift.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) to enhance TIR tracking by fusing motion and infrared data.
- Uses two models - system model leverages motion data to estimate target positions (prior probability). Observation model uses infrared data to determine likelihood of those positions (likelihood probability).
- System model based on 2D Brownian motion, independent of infrared data. Observation model builds on deep learning tracker.
- Bayes formula combines prior and likelihood probability for final position estimate. Template updated dynamically.

Main Contributions:
- Novel DBF framework to effectively combine motion and infrared data for robust TIR tracking.
- Development of system and observation models working collaboratively for target localization.
- Validation through experiments on benchmark datasets, showing superiority over trackers relying on infrared data alone.

In summary, the paper proposes a Deep Bayesian Filtering approach for TIR tracking that strategically incorporates motion information along with infrared data to overcome limitations of existing infrared-only methods. This is achieved via dedicated system and observation models within a Bayesian filtering framework. Experiments demonstrate enhanced performance, especially in complex scenarios.
