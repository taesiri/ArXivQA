# [DQSSA: A Quantum-Inspired Solution for Maximizing Influence in Online   Social Networks (Student Abstract)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18676)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new algorithm called Discretized Quantum-based Salp Swarm Algorithm (DQSSA) for solving the influence maximization (IM) problem in social networks. The goal of IM is to find a small set of seed nodes in a network that maximizes the spread of influence. The paper argues that previous IM algorithms suffer from issues like premature convergence and ineffective influence spread. To address these limitations, DQSSA integrates techniques like reverse learning, quantum mutation, and discretization from quantum-inspired metaheuristics into the Salp Swarm Algorithm. Experiments compare DQSSA against centrality measures and metaheuristic algorithms on four real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that DQSSA consistently achieves superior performance in terms of execution time, value of the influence estimation function, and actual influence spread simulated using the Independent Cascade model. Overall, the proposed DQSSA method provides an effective solution to the IM problem that balances influence spread and time complexity. The fusion of quantum concepts with swarm intelligence proves to be highly promising for this domain.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a Discretized Quantum-based Salp Swarm Algorithm (DQSSA) for optimizing influence diffusion in social networks, which outperforms existing algorithms in terms of execution time and influence spread.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new algorithm called Discretized Quantum-based Salp Swarm Algorithm (DQSSA) for solving the influence maximization problem in social networks. Specifically:

- They propose combining quantum-inspired concepts like reverse learning and quantum mutation with the Salp Swarm Algorithm to improve its performance and avoid getting trapped in local optima (premature convergence). 

- They then discretize this quantum salp swarm algorithm to make it suitable for selecting optimal seed nodes (discrete set of influencer nodes) in social networks.

- Experiments on real-world datasets show DQSSA outperforms other baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of influence spread and execution time.

So in summary, the key contribution is presenting DQSSA as a promising new solution to maximize influence diffusion in social networks, with experimental results demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. The fusion of quantum concepts with salp swarm optimization and subsequent discretization seems to be the key ideas behind its effectiveness.
