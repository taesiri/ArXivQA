# [SurroundSDF: Implicit 3D Scene Understanding Based on Signed Distance   Field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14366)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for 3D scene understanding like 3D reconstruction and 3D perception have limitations. 3D reconstruction methods can generate dense point clouds with semantics but fail to construct accurate and continuous obstacle surfaces. 3D perception methods can predict occupancy grids and semantics but are limited by the grid resolution. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SurroundSDF, an implicit neural framework to achieve continuous and accurate 3D scene understanding from surround-view images. The key ideas are:

1) Represent the scene using a Signed Distance Field (SDF) and semantic field predicted by a neural network. This allows querying geometric and semantic information at any continuous location.

2) Propose a "Sandwich Eikonal" formulation to supervise the SDF learning in a weakly supervised manner. This uses both LiDAR points and occupancy grids to apply constraints on both sides of object surfaces. 

3) Jointly supervise the SDF and semantics to reduce inconsistencies between them.

4) Generate different 3D representations like meshes, occupancies and semantic reconstructions using the predicted fields.

Main Contributions:

1) First surround-view based implicit 3D scene perception method using SDF representation.

2) Sandwich Eikonal - a novel formulation to supervise SDF learning without explicit SDF labels. Emphasizes constraints on both sides of surfaces.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art on semantic occupancy prediction task on nuScenes dataset. 

4) Demonstrates continuous geometry prediction and semantic scene reconstruction from predicted fields.

In summary, the paper presents a novel neural implicit framework for accurate and continuous 3D scene understanding from surround-view images using proposed techniques like Sandwich Eikonal supervision.
