# [Supervision via Competition: Robot Adversaries for Learning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01685)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: Can an adversarial learning framework, where one robot learns a task and another robot learns to disrupt that task, lead to improved performance and more robust learning compared to standard self-supervised learning?Specifically, the paper explores using adversarial robots for grasping tasks, where one robot learns to grasp objects and another robot learns adversarial tasks like shaking the grasped object or snatching it away. The hypothesis is that the competition from the adversarial robot will force the original grasping robot to learn more robust grasps, leading to better performance.The key questions explored are:- Can an adversary provide better supervision compared to standard weak self-supervision? - Does learning via competition with an adversary help improve grasping performance on novel test objects?- Is adversarial learning a more effective strategy compared to having multiple robots collect data collaboratively in parallel?The paper aims to demonstrate that the proposed adversarial framework can address concerns around supervision quality and data efficiency in self-supervised robotic learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an adversarial learning framework for robotics. Specifically, the authors demonstrate how training an adversary robot to defeat the original robot learner can force the original robot to learn more robustly and efficiently. The key ideas are:- Using an adversarial robot instead of collaborative robots for data collection and training. The adversarial robot provides a stronger notion of success/failure compared to weak self-supervision.- Joint training of the original robot model along with an adversary model. While the adversary tries to make the original robot fail, the original robot adapts to defeat the adversary leading to more robust learning.- Applying this framework to the task of robotic grasping. The grasping robot trained with an adversarial shaking robot achieved higher grasp success rates compared to standard self-supervised training.In summary, the main contribution is introducing the concept of adversarial robots for more efficient self-supervised robotic learning. The experiments on grasping demonstrate improved performance and sample efficiency over baseline approaches. The proposed adversarial training paradigm has the potential to enhance learning for other robotics tasks as well.
