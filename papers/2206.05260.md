# [Balanced Product of Calibrated Experts for Long-Tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05260)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How can we learn an ensemble of diverse experts, where each expert targets different parts of the label distribution, such that the ensemble as a whole is provably unbiased and Fisher-consistent for minimizing the balanced error? 

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Extending the theoretical foundation of logit adjustment to ensembles by parameterizing diverse target distributions for different experts. 

- Proving that the proposed Balanced Product of Experts (BalPoE) attains the average bias of all its experts, and is Fisher-consistent for minimizing balanced error under a constraint on the expert biases.

- Identifying proper calibration as a necessary requirement for the theoretical guarantees to hold, and using mixup to achieve expert calibration in practice.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art results with the proposed calibrated BalPoE ensemble on multiple long-tailed recognition benchmarks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is about learning a provably unbiased and balanced ensemble of diverse experts through calibrated logit adjustment, which is theoretically grounded and achieves excellent empirical performance on long-tailed datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

- The authors extend the theoretical foundation of logit adjustment to train a balanced ensemble of experts (BalPoE). They show this is theoretically sound by proving the ensemble is Fisher-consistent for minimizing the balanced error.

- They find proper calibration of the experts is necessary to apply the previous theoretical result. They show mixup is important for expert calibration, which is not fulfilled by default. Meeting the calibration assumption ensures Fisher consistency.

- The proposed BalPoE method achieves new state-of-the-art results on three long-tailed benchmark datasets - CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist-2018.

In summary, the key ideas are:

- Extending logit adjustment theory to ensembles, and proving Fisher consistency of the balanced ensemble.

- Identifying calibration as a critical requirement, and using mixup to achieve it.

- Obtaining superior performance by having a balanced and calibrated ensemble, setting new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.

The main novelty lies in the theoretical analysis and calibration insights that underpin the strong empirical results. The work generalizes previous logit-adjusted expert methods in a principled way.
