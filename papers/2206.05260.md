# [Balanced Product of Calibrated Experts for Long-Tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05260)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question/hypothesis of this paper is:

How can we learn an ensemble of diverse experts, where each expert targets different parts of the label distribution, such that the ensemble as a whole is provably unbiased and Fisher-consistent for minimizing the balanced error? 

The key ideas and contributions appear to be:

- Extending the theoretical foundation of logit adjustment to ensembles by parameterizing diverse target distributions for different experts. 

- Proving that the proposed Balanced Product of Experts (BalPoE) attains the average bias of all its experts, and is Fisher-consistent for minimizing balanced error under a constraint on the expert biases.

- Identifying proper calibration as a necessary requirement for the theoretical guarantees to hold, and using mixup to achieve expert calibration in practice.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art results with the proposed calibrated BalPoE ensemble on multiple long-tailed recognition benchmarks.

In summary, the central hypothesis is about learning a provably unbiased and balanced ensemble of diverse experts through calibrated logit adjustment, which is theoretically grounded and achieves excellent empirical performance on long-tailed datasets.
