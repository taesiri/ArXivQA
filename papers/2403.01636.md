# [Sample Efficient Myopic Exploration Through Multitask Reinforcement   Learning with Diverse Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01636)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Multitask reinforcement learning (MTRL) methods have shown improved statistical efficiency in estimating model parameters by exploiting shared structures across tasks. However, the exploration aspect, which is crucial in reinforcement learning, has been overlooked. 

- This paper studies whether algorithms with myopic exploration designs like ε-greedy, which are simple but sample-inefficient in single task learning, can be efficient for MTRL when learning from a diverse set of tasks.

Main Contributions:

- Defines a "Multitask Myopic Exploration Gap (MEG)" to measure the potential for improving the current greedy policy through trajectories generated by myopic exploration policies.

- Shows that with a "diverse" set of tasks that lower-bounds the Multitask MEG for any suboptimal policy, a simple algorithm exploring each task with a mixture of ε-greedy policies from other tasks can achieve polynomial sample complexity.

- Provides explicit constructions of diverse tasks and proves sample complexity bounds for tabular MDPs, linear MDPs, and Linear Quadratic Regulators. 

- Conducts experiments in a continuous control environment showing tasks with more spread spectrum in the feature covariance matrices leads to better training performance and generalization.

- The results provide the first demonstration of "exploration benefits" of multitask RL and may explain the empirical success of ε-greedy despite worst-case sample inefficiency results.

In summary, the paper formally shows myopic exploration can be sample-efficient for multitask RL when the tasks are adequately diverse, through both theory and experiments. This bridges theory and practice regarding simple exploration strategies in MTRL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

This paper shows that when trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks, multitask reinforcement learning algorithms with simple epsilon-greedy exploration can be sample efficient, demonstrating the exploration benefits of multitask learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that when trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks, algorithms with myopic exploration designs like $\epsilon$-greedy that are normally inefficient can be sample-efficient for multitask reinforcement learning. Specifically, the paper proposes a algorithm that explores each task using a mixture of $\epsilon$-greedy policies learned from other tasks, and shows this algorithm can be sample-efficient under a "diversity" condition on the task set. This provides a theoretical explanation for why myopic exploration often works well empirically in multitask settings, despite worst-case exponential sample complexity results in single task settings. The paper also validates the role of diversity in experiments on robotic control tasks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multitask reinforcement learning (MTRL): Learning policies for multiple related reinforcement learning tasks simultaneously, aiming to improve efficiency over learning each task individually. 

- Myopic exploration: Simple exploration strategies like ε-greedy that select random actions without long-term planning. Shown to be inefficient theoretically but works well empirically.  

- Sample complexity: The number of interactions with the environment needed to learn a near-optimal policy. Goal is polynomial sample complexity.

- Diversity: The concept that having variety between tasks in a MTRL setting can lead to more efficient exploration. Proposed definition of diverse tasks.

- Linear MDPs: MDPs where transition dynamics and rewards are linear functions of feature representations. Used as a case study.

- Bellman error: The error in satisfying the Bellman optimality equation using an approximate value function. Related concept is Bellman Eluder dimension.

- Curriculum learning: Training on a sequence of tasks ordered by difficulty. Connection shown between curriculum and efficient exploration.

In summary, key ideas involve using diversity in MTRL to enable sample-efficient learning with simple myopic exploration, validated theoretically in linear MDPs and empirically on a continuous control task.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes that myopic exploration can be sample-efficient in the multitask RL setting if the task set is sufficiently diverse. However, it does not provide a concrete characterization of what constitutes a "sufficiently diverse" task set. What specific properties must a task set satisfy mathematically in order to guarantee the sample efficiency of myopic exploration?

2. Could you explain the intuition behind why diversity in the task set enables myopic exploration to work well? Does diversity allow the exploratory policies from other tasks to cover the state/action space better compared to a single task setting?

3. The proposed algorithm explores each task using a mixture policy over the exploratory policies of all other tasks. What is the intuition behind using this mixture policy? Does the mixing allow for more efficient exploration compared to just using the exploratory policy of a single other task? 

4. How does the proposed Multitask Myopic Exploration Gap (MMEG) condition mathematically quantify the notion of diversity? What are the key differences compared to the original Myopic Exploration Gap (MEG) definition which was for single task RL?

5. The paper analyzes MMEG and provides sample complexity results for tabular MDPs and linear MDPs. Could you discuss how the construction of diverse tasks differs between these two settings? What additional assumptions need to be made on the features/rewards?

6. The sample complexity bounds have an extra factor of $|\mathcal{M}|^2$ compared to results for single task RL with strategic exploration. Is this multiplicative factor inevitable for any algorithm with myopic exploration in the multitask setting?

7. How does the concept of diversity studied in this paper connect to diversity notions studied in multitask supervised learning? Is there any formal relationship between multitask myopic exploration gap and representation learning bounds?

8. The experiments demonstrate improved training with more eigenvalue spread in the feature covariance matrix. Does this validate the theory and indicate that spectral properties of feature matrices could be used to construct diverse tasks?

9. The paper studies finite horizon MDPs. Do you think similar benefits of multitask learning for enabling myopic exploration would hold even for infinite horizon discounted MDPs? Would the notion of diversity and results need to change?

10. A key limitation is the gap between theory and practice in terms of sample complexity. Do you foresee the possibility of improving the bounds to nearly match single task strategic exploration, while still using myopic exploration?
