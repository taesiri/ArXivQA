# [Workflow Optimization for Parallel Split Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10092)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Workflow Optimization for Parallel Split Learning":

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of long training times (makespan) in federated learning systems with resource-constrained devices. Specifically, it focuses on parallel split learning systems where multiple "helper" nodes can process parts of neural network models in parallel to speed up training. However, optimally assigning client devices to helpers and scheduling the processing tasks is challenging. The paper formally shows this joint assignment and scheduling problem is NP-hard.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes two methods to efficiently solve this problem in practical systems:

1. An ADMM-based decomposition method that breaks the problem into two subproblems, solves them iteratively, and leverages the symmetry in forward and backward propagation. It uses ADMM for the forward propagation subproblem and provides a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for the backward propagation scheduling.

2. A balanced-greedy heuristic that first assigns clients to balance load across helpers, then uses first-come-first-served scheduling. This is lower complexity but may achieve worse performance.

Based on testbed experiments, the paper develops a solution strategy to select the best method based on heterogeneity and size of the system.

Main Contributions:
- Formal problem formulation for joint assignment & scheduling in parallel split learning 
- Proof that the optimization problem is NP-hard
- ADMM-based method to decompose problem and solve subproblems
- Optimal polynomial-time algorithm for backward propagation scheduling  
- Lower-complexity balanced-greedy heuristic
- Performance evaluation using testbed measurements & proposal of adaptive solution strategy
- Demonstration of up to 52.3% makespan reduction compared to a baseline approach

In summary, the paper provides both theoretical analysis and practical methods to optimize the workflow in parallel split learning systems for faster federated learning. The solution strategy is shown to significantly reduce training time.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper formulates the joint problem of client-helper assignments and scheduling in parallel split learning to minimize training makespan, proposes two solution methods based on problem decomposition and load balancing, and develops a solution strategy comprising these methods that adapts to different scenarios and achieves significant gains over a baseline approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It formulates the joint problem of client-helper assignments and scheduling decisions in parallel split learning with the goal of minimizing the training makespan. It proves this problem is NP-hard.

2) It proposes a solution method based on decomposing the problem into two subproblems - one focusing on forward propagation and the other on backward propagation. The forward propagation subproblem is solved using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

3) It provides a polynomial time algorithm to optimally solve the backward propagation subproblem by reducing it to a single machine scheduling problem. 

4) It proposes a low-complexity heuristic algorithm called balanced-greedy that balances the workload across helpers in a greedy fashion.

5) Through extensive evaluations using measurements from a testbed, it develops a solution strategy comprising the ADMM-based method and the balanced-greedy heuristic depending on the scenario. This strategy is shown to find near-optimal solutions and outperform a baseline scheme by up to 52.3% in reducing makespan.

In summary, the key contribution is the formulation of the joint optimization problem, the development of both exact and heuristic solution methods, and the design of an effective solution strategy tailored to the characteristics of the parallel split learning system.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proves that the joint problem of client-helper assignments and scheduling decisions is NP-hard. What is the intuition behind this proof? What type of reductions were used to prove this?

2. The paper proposes an ADMM-based method to decompose the problem into two subproblems. What are these two subproblems and how does the decomposition work? What are the benefits of using ADMM for this? 

3. Explain the two subproblems solved using the ADMM method in more detail. In particular, what is the forward propagation subproblem and how is it solved? What about the backward propagation subproblem?

4. The ADMM method relaxes some coupling constraints between assignments and schedules. How does the method ensure feasibility after convergence? What correction step is employed?

5. What techniques are used to speed up the convergence of the ADMM method? In particular, how are the relaxed constraints tightened to accelerate convergence? 

6. Explain in detail the balanced greedy heuristic for client-helper assignments. How does it balance load across helpers? What scheduling method is then used on top of these assignments?

7. What observations from the experiments motivate the design of a hybrid solution strategy between the ADMM and balanced greedy methods? What are the tradeoffs?

8. How sensitive is the performance of the proposed methods to the neural network model structure and cut layer choices? What dependencies were observed?

9. What is the impact of time slot granularity on solution quality and problem size? Explain this tradeoff both conceptually and through the experimental observations.

10. How does adding more helpers to the system impact the reductions observed in training time? Diminishing returns were seen - explain why.
