# [Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06259)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we align large language models to perform high-quality instruction following in a scalable way with minimal human annotation?

The key points are:

- Instruction following is an important capability for LLMs to be useful assistants. However, getting high performance typically requires large amounts of human annotated data which is expensive.

- This paper explores using an iterative self-training approach to automatically generate and curate instruction following examples from unlabeled web text. 

- The core ideas are self-augmentation (generating candidate instruction-output pairs from web text) and self-curation (using the model to score/select high quality examples).

- By iterating self-augmentation and self-curation, they are able to bootstrap stronger instruction following models from unlabeled data.

- The main hypothesis seems to be that this approach can produce high quality instruction following models with greater scalability and less human annotation compared to purely supervised methods.

In summary, the key research question is how to scale up instruction following capabilities for LLMs efficiently, and the proposed solution is an iterative self-training approach to automatically create and curate instruction following data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be developing an iterative self-training algorithm for improving large language models' ability to follow instructions. The key steps are:

1. Self-augmentation: Using a seed instruction following model to generate candidate instructions for unlabeled documents/text from a web corpus, to create training examples of (instruction, document) pairs. 

2. Self-curation: Using the model itself to score and select high quality examples from the candidate training pairs. This is done iteratively - a better model from one round can better curate data for the next round.

3. Instruction backtranslation: The overall approach is inspired by backtranslation from machine translation, but rather than translating between languages, it "backtranslates" unlabeled text into candidate instructions to train an instruction following model.

The main idea is to leverage large unlabeled corpora, and use the model itself to augment and curate high quality training data in a scalable self-training framework. Their resulting model "Humpback" outperforms other non-distilled models on the Alpaca leaderboard for instruction following.

In summary, the key contribution is a scalable self-training method to improve language models' instruction following abilities, without needing labeled data or distillation. The self-augmentation and iterative self-curation are the main novel components compared to prior instruction tuning approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable self-training method called instruction backtranslation to improve large language models at following instructions by using the model itself to generate and select high-quality training data from unlabeled text.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on self-alignment with instruction backtranslation compares to other related work on improving large language models' ability to follow instructions:

- Uses unlabelled data vs labeled data: This method leverages large amounts of unlabelled web text rather than relying solely on human-annotated instruction-following examples. Other methods like RLHF, LIMA, etc rely more heavily on labeled data.

- Self-alignment approach: The core idea is to use the model itself to augment and curate training data, rather than relying on an external model or human annotations. This aligns with other recent self-alignment methods, but differs in the instruction backtranslation procedure. 

- Iterative self-training: The model generates and scores training data, and is iteratively retrained on filtered examples. This iterative approach of "self-distillation" is similar to work like Constitutional AI but tailored for instruction tuning here.

- Backtranslation for instruction-tuning: The idea of generating instructions for existing outputs is inspired by backtranslation in machine translation. Other works have explored generating instructions or augmenting instructions, but not paired with outputs from a web corpus.

- Evaluation on Alpaca leaderboard: Demonstrates strong empirical results on instruction following benchmarks compared to other non-distilled methods. Indicates effectiveness of this self-alignment approach for the problem setup.

Overall, this work provides a novel self-supervised method specialized for the task of aligning LLMs to follow instructions. The backtranslation setup and iterative training process differs from prior work on instruction tuning, self-alignment objectives, or data augmentation techniques. The strong empirical results validate this as an promising approach in this problem domain.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Scaling up the method using larger unlabeled corpora as the source of augmentation data. The authors mention this could yield further gains in performance.

- Improving coverage on long-tail categories of outputs. The authors note their method currently struggles with some types of precise formatting instructions. Approaches could include larger-scale backtranslation focused on certain domains, or upsampling the distribution of unlabeled data. 

- Incorporating safety measures into the augmentation pipeline, such as using red teaming data or optimizing for harm detection/reduction. The authors note their method currently does not take special precautions for safety.

- Exploring different self-supervision approaches for scoring and selecting high-quality examples, beyond the prompting method they demonstrate.

- Analysis and mitigation of potential biases amplified from the unlabeled web data during augmentation. The authors show their model improves at detecting some biases but may still generate biased outputs.

- Comparisons to other self-alignment techniques like self-consistency training or dual training. The authors currently only demonstrate backtranslation for self-augmentation.

- Leveraging retrieval models over the unlabeled corpus to better select candidate passages for augmentation.

- Jointly learning to self-augment and self-curate by optimizing the quality of selected outputs. The current approach uses separate steps/models.

- Exploring self-augmentation for other modalities like code, knowledge, etc. beyond just natural language instructions and text.

In summary, the main directions are scaling up the current approach, improving coverage and safety, exploring alternative self-supervision methods, and extending the technique to other data types/models. The authors lay out a clear path for building on their approach to instruction backtranslation.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a scalable method to build a high quality instruction following language model by automatically labeling human-written text with corresponding instructions. The approach, called instruction backtranslation, starts with a language model finetuned on a small seed set of instruction-response pairs, along with a large unlabeled web corpus. The seed model first generates instruction prompts for segments of the web text (self-augmentation), creating candidate training pairs. Because directly using all these candidates performs poorly, the key insight is that the seed model can also score these pairs (self-curation) to select only high quality examples for further training. By iterating this data augmentation and selection, each round produces a better model for scoring, resulting in higher quality training data. Evaluating LLaMa models trained with this approach shows they outperform all other non-distilled models on the Alpaca benchmark, demonstrating effective self-alignment. The method provides a more scalable way to create strong instruction-following models compared to manual annotation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable method to build a high quality instruction following language model by automatically labelling human-written text with corresponding instructions. The approach, called instruction backtranslation, starts with a language model finetuned on a small seed set of instruction-response example pairs. It then uses this model in an iterative process to augment the training data and curate high quality examples. In the augmentation step, the model generates instruction prompts for unlabeled web text segments that could serve as responses. This results in candidate instruction-response pairs. In the curation step, the model scores these candidates to select only high quality examples. The curated data is used to retrain an improved model, which can better curate examples, and so on iteratively. 

The resulting model, called Humpback, outperforms all other non-distilled models on the Alpaca instruction following benchmark, using less human-labeled data. The approach demonstrates the viability of leveraging large unlabeled corpora to develop instruction following abilities, using the model's own predictions to refine and scale up the training data. The self-supervised augmentation and curation steps avoid cost and bottlenecks of manual data creation. Experiments analyze the impact of data quantity versus quality, and show steady gains from scaling up high quality instruction examples.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called instruction backtranslation to finetune large language models (LLMs) like LLaMa to improve their ability to follow instructions. The key idea is to leverage unlabeled data, specifically a web corpus, to automatically create a high-quality dataset of instruction-response pairs for finetuning. It involves two main steps - self-augmentation, where the LLM generates possible instructions for unlabeled web documents, creating candidate training examples of (instruction, response) pairs; and self-curation, where the LLM also scores and selects only high-quality pairs from these candidates to finetune itself on. This overall procedure of using the model to augment and curate its own training data is executed iteratively, so in each round the improved model from finetuning helps better select training data to further enhance itself. By applying this instruction backtranslation approach for a couple of iterations, the authors are able to create an LLaMa-based model called Humpback that outperforms prior LLaMa models at instruction following.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key focus of this paper is developing a scalable method for improving large language models' ability to follow instructions, without relying on large amounts of human-labeled data. The authors aim to address the challenge that existing high-performing instruction-following models typically require large amounts of high-quality human-annotated data, which can be expensive and difficult to scale up. 

The core questions/problems the paper seems to be tackling are:

- How can we create a high-quality dataset for instruction following without extensive manual annotation?

- Can an iterative self-training approach allow models to augment and curate their own training data from unlabeled sources to improve at instruction following?

- Does this method of "instruction backtranslation" enable language models to scale up their performance on diverse instruction following, surpassing other methods that don't use distillation?

So in summary, the paper is focused on developing a more scalable method for aligning LLMs to follow instructions across a broad range of tasks, while minimizing the need for human involvement in dataset creation. The key novelty seems to be using the model itself to augment and curate self-training data from unlabeled sources through an iterative process.
