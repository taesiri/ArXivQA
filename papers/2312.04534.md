## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new task called virtual try-on from unconstrained designs (ucVTON) to enable flexible and photorealistic synthesis of personalized composite clothing. Compared to prior arts, ucVTON significantly expands the allowable input types for both style (text prompts or images) and texture (full garments, cropped sections, or patches). To handle the resulting entanglement challenge when using images as complex inputs, the authors develop a two-stage pipeline that explicitly disentangles style and texture. The first stage generates a human parsing map reflecting the desired style, while the second stage composites textures onto parsing map areas based on the texture input. To represent complex, non-stationary textures, the paper introduces extracting hierarchical and balanced CLIP features equipped with position encoding. Experiments demonstrate superior synthesis quality and personalization enabled by flexible control over mixing and matching styles and textures. Key contributions include the new ucVTON task definition, the two-stage disentanglement approach, and incorporating hierarchical CLIP features with position encoding to capture intricate textures. By significantly advancing the input flexibility and output quality, this work brings virtual try-on to a new level benefiting applications from online shopping to fashion design.
