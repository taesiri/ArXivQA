# [On Exploring the Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models with   Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00353)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform reasoning on knowledge graphs using their internal knowledge gained during pre-training. Two research questions are investigated: 1) To what extent LLMs can accurately recall facts and relations from their internal knowledge graphs, and 2) How well LLMs can infer implicit relations from a given context paragraph. The authors evaluate LLMs on tasks like tail entity prediction, relation prediction, relation extraction, and contextual path finding between entities. They introduce metrics to measure accuracy as well as different types of hallucinations made by models. The results demonstrate LLMs are able to recall factual knowledge to a reasonable degree and infer relations from context, with more advanced models like GPT-4 performing the best. However, there is still room for improvement to reduce content and ontology hallucinations during reasoning. The preliminary analysis provides motivation for further research leveraging LLMs' internal knowledge graphs for knowledge retrieval and reasoning problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper examines the capacity of large language models to reason with knowledge graphs using their internal knowledge learned during pre-training, investigating their ability to recall information, infer direct and multi-hop relations, and generate contextual paths.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper investigates two research questions exploring the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason with their internal knowledge graphs:

- RQ1: To what extent can LLMs accurately recall information from knowledge graphs?

- RQ2: To what extent can LLMs infer knowledge graph relations from context?

2) The paper distinguishes two types of hallucinations that can occur in knowledge graph reasoning tasks: content hallucination and ontology hallucination.

3) The experimental results indicate that LLMs can successfully retrieve knowledge graph information from memory and infer knowledge graph relations from given context to a reasonable extent. 

In summary, the main contribution is an initial investigation into the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with respect to their internal knowledge graphs, formulated through two key research questions. The paper also identifies and categorizes potential issues with hallucinations that can arise during knowledge graph reasoning.

The paper explores the ability of large language models to perform reasoning tasks with knowledge graphs, both in terms of recalling information from their internal knowledge graphs learned during pre-training as well as inferring knowledge graph relations from input context. Key capabilities examined include tail entity and relation prediction, relation extraction, and contextual path generation. The paper also discusses issues like content and ontology hallucination during knowledge graph reasoning and techniques like prompt design and multi-step prompting to improve performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes examining the ability of LLMs to reason with their internal knowledge graphs. What are some ways the authors could further validate whether LLMs actually possess internal knowledge graphs versus just showing competent reasoning ability?

2. The paper evaluates performance on knowledge graph reasoning through accuracy metrics. What are some other metrics that could be used to provide additional insight into the reasoning capability of LLMs? 

3. For the non-contextual relation generation tasks, what are some ways the diversity of answers could be evaluated beyond just accuracy? Could metrics like novelty or surprise be applicable?

4. The paper identifies two types of hallucinations that can occur with LLMs - content hallucination and ontology hallucination. What are some ways these could be further characterized or distinguished from each other? 

5. For the contextual path generation task, what are some additional path correctness metrics beyond Normalized Graph Edit Distance that may provide further insight into the performance?

6. The paper explores knowledge graph reasoning tasks with both one-hop and multi-hop relations. What are some ways to systematically evaluate the impact of increasing hop complexity? 

7. The prompts designed for the LLMs seem simple given the complexity of knowledge graph reasoning. What are some ways the prompts could be improved or expanded on to better support reasoning?  

8. The paper evaluates 3 different LLMs. What are some additional recent LLMs with reasoning capabilities that could be included for comparison?

9. The paper conducts experiments only on the DBPedia knowledge graph. What are some challenges that may arise if evaluating on different knowledge graphs?

10. The paper concludes there is great potential for using LLMs for knowledge graph reasoning tasks. What are the next steps needed to transition these capabilities to real-world applications?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 to perform reasoning using their internal knowledge graphs learned during pre-training. Specifically, it examines whether LLMs can accurately recall information from their internal knowledge graphs and infer new relations based on context. 

Proposed Solution
- To test information recall, the authors task LLMs with non-contextual relation generation like tail entity prediction and relation prediction on DBpedia triples. 
- To test contextual inference, they evaluate LLMs on relation extraction using context paragraphs from Wikipedia and on contextual path generation to find multi-hop paths explaining connections between entities in context documents.

Key Contributions  
- Identified two types of hallucinations in LLM reasoning - content hallucinations (non-factual statements) and ontology hallucinations (relations invalid as per ontology)
- Experiment results show advanced LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 can successfully recall information from internal knowledge graphs and infer new relations from context with reasonable accuracy
- There is still scope for improvement via better prompting strategies to reduce hallucinations and increase accuracy

In summary, this paper explores and evaluates the reasoning capability of LLMs using their internal knowledge graphs. The key findings suggest LLMs have promising ability for knowledge graph reasoning, but better prompting is needed to reduce factual errors and invalid responses.
