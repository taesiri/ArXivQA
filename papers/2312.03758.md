# [Stock Movement and Volatility Prediction from Tweets, Macroeconomic   Factors and Historical Prices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03758)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Predicting stock market movement and volatility is challenging but important for investors and policymakers. 
- Prior works have limitations in using tweets for prediction: (1) Tweets have a lot of noise, only some genuinely reflect market, (2) Analysis is focused on individual stocks, overlooking sector correlations, (3) Predicting only direction, not magnitude of price changes.

Proposed Solution - ECON Framework
- Efficient tweet filtering to extract relevant tweets and reduce noise.
- Self-aware mechanism to model relationships between stocks, sectors and macro factors.  
- Multi-dimensional perception of stock market in a multi-task fashion to predict both movement and volatility.

Key Contributions:
- Design an efficient tweet filtering framework specialized for financial domain. Greatly reduces computation cost while enhancing prediction accuracy.

- Develop a self-aware mechanism to learn dynamic relationships among stocks, sectors and macro factors through a distance-based temporal process. Provides both micro and macro level perspectives.

- Formulate stock prediction in a multi-task fashion - forecasting both movement direction and fluctuation magnitude. Better matches real-world trading needs.  

- Comprehensively evaluate ECON framework on a real-world dataset. It outperforms both conventional and deep learning baselines by 1.7-4% in accuracy and MCC metrics. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in predicting stock market movements and volatility.

In summary, the paper presents an ECON framework to effectively filter tweet data, model multi-level relationships of finance data, and formulate stock prediction as a multi-task problem. Evaluations demonstrate improved performance over other methods.
