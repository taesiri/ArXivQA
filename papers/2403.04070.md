# [Improving Adversarial Training using Vulnerability-Aware Perturbation   Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04070)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Adversarial training (AT) is an effective defense method against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. It involves training the model on adversarial examples crafted within a fixed perturbation budget. 
- However, natural examples have varying degrees of inherent vulnerability. Crafting adversarial examples with a fixed perturbation budget for all examples may not sufficiently improve the efficacy of AT.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes two methods - Margin-Weighted Perturbation Budget (MWPB) and Standard-Deviation-Weighted Perturbation Budget (SDWPB) - for assigning instance-specific perturbation budgets to adversarial examples used in AT. 

- MWPB estimates the vulnerability of each natural example using its logit margin. It assigns larger perturbation budgets to examples with positive margins (likely robust) and smaller budgets to examples with negative margins (likely vulnerable).

- SDWPB estimates vulnerability using a modified standard deviation of the model's predicted class probabilities. It assigns larger perturbation budgets to examples with lower modified standard deviation (likely robust).

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that adversarial examples originating from vulnerable natural examples incur larger inner maximization loss increments compared to those from robust examples under fixed perturbation.  

- Proposes two methods to assign instance-specific perturbation budgets based on estimated vulnerability, instead of using a fixed budget.

- Shows improved robustness of AT, TRADES and MART when combined with MWPB and SDWPB over CIFAR-10, SVHN and Tiny Imagenet datasets.

- Demonstrates superior performance compared to prior works involving margin-based reweighting and adaptive perturbation methods.

In summary, the paper presents a case for adaptive perturbation budgets in AT based on estimated sample vulnerability. The proposed MWPB and SDWPB methods lead to enhanced robustness over fixed perturbation budgets.
