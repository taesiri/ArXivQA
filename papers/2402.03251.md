# [CLIP Can Understand Depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Prior works have shown that pretrained vision-language models like CLIP struggle to generalize well to complex and abstract tasks like monocular depth estimation. This is likely because depth-related concepts are not adequately learned from the web-crawled data used to pretrain CLIP. Directly fine-tuning CLIP for depth estimation has downsides in terms of data requirements and training costs. This paper explores whether CLIP's knowledge can be adapted for depth estimation without fine-tuning the original model.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose CLIP2Depth, a framework that leverages a frozen CLIP and trains only a small decoder module along with a learnable "mirror" token embedding matrix. This mirror module acts as a non-human language prompt for CLIP's text encoder, guiding the image encoder's outputs for depth estimation. Intuitively, the mirror allows CLIP to "understand" geometric concepts by reflecting them into its text encoder via a simple latent embedding.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrates that a frozen CLIP can achieve depth estimation performance on par with state-of-the-art vision-only models, through minimal adaptation using the proposed mirror prompt.
- Surpasses all prior CLIP-based approaches for depth estimation by a large margin on NYU and KITTI datasets.
- Shows significantly improved consistency in estimated depths across both time and space compared to previous methods.
- Ablation studies validate the role of mirror prompts in enabling CLIP to capture depth for semantic objects without relying solely on image features.
- Opens up the potential for adjusting inaccurate prior knowledge in vision-language models using non-human language supervision, rather than extensive fine-tuning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called CLIP2Depth that adapts CLIP for monocular dense depth estimation by training a compact decoder and small learnable prompt embedding matrix with the frozen CLIP model, demonstrating that CLIP's prior knowledge can be effectively generalized to depth estimation without fine-tuning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is demonstrating that the prior knowledge of large vision-language models like CLIP can be effectively generalized to domains that are difficult to learn from web-crawled data, without needing to fine-tune the model. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes CLIP2Depth, a framework that adapts a frozen CLIP model for monocular dense depth estimation by adding a small learnable component called "mirror". This mirror embedding allows CLIP to achieve depth estimation performance on par with state-of-the-art vision-only models.

2) The method shows that incorrect or suboptimal prior knowledge in CLIP's image-text alignment can be adjusted through the use of non-human language prompts like the mirror embedding. This highlights a way to leverage the knowledge in large foundation models for new domains where their pre-training is not sufficient.

3) The model outperforms all previous CLIP-based depth estimation methods by a large margin, while preserving CLIP's generalizability. This is achieved with minimal changes to the frozen CLIP model.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an effective way to adapt vision-language models like CLIP to new domains, where their generalization is challenging, through compact add-ons and non-human language prompts. The depth estimation experiments validate this concept and its potential.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with it are:

- CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)
- Monocular depth estimation
- Dense prediction
- Mirror embedding
- Non-human language supervision
- Adjusting suboptimal prior knowledge
- Vision-language foundation models
- Task agnostic generalization

The paper proposes a method called CLIP2Depth to adapt the CLIP model for monocular dense depth estimation without fine-tuning the original vision-language alignment of CLIP. It introduces a learnable embedding called "mirror" which acts as a static prompt to the CLIP text encoder. Experiments show this approach matches performance of previous state-of-the-art vision-only models on depth estimation benchmarks. The key ideas focus on using non-human language supervision via the "mirror" to adjust inefficient prior knowledge in CLIP for understanding depth cues.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a learnable embedding matrix called "mirror" as a replacement for the subword token embeddings of CLIP. What is the motivation behind using this non-human language token embedding? How does it help adapt CLIP's knowledge for depth estimation?

2. The paper freezes most components of CLIP and only trains the "mirror" embedding and a small decoder module. What is the benefit of freezing the CLIP encoders rather than fine-tuning them? How does this preserve the versatile prior knowledge of CLIP? 

3. The "mirror" embedding acts as a static prompt for the text encoder. How does this allow the model to leverage the rich semantic knowledge from the language supervision capability of CLIP? What role does the text encoder play in the overall framework?

4. The paper argues that querying depth cues by reflecting the entire image in a single non-human prompt is more effective than combining similarities from multiple prompts. What is the rationale behind this design choice? How do the ablation studies support this?

5. The framework utilizes knowledge distillation from a pretrained CLIPSeg module. Why is transfer learning from semantic segmentation particularly useful? How does it enable correcting wrong biases in the image-text correlation of CLIP?

6. What are the key differences between the conditioning method used here versus previous works that rely on computing pairwise similarity scores? What are the limitations of similarity-based approaches?

7. The paper demonstrates superior performance over prior CLIP-based depth estimation methods. What factors contribute to the improved accuracy and consistency of depth prediction? 

8. How does the framework balance utilizing signals from the image encoder versus the text encoder? What does the ablation study reveal about how much each contributes?

9. The method matches performance of several leading vision-only models for depth prediction. What does this demonstrate about the generalization capability and potential of vision-language foundation models?

10. What directions for future work does this approach open up, in terms of better utilizing suboptimal prior knowledge of large vision-language models? What other tasks or domains could this be applied to?
