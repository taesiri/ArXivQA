# [Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning On Whole-Slide Pathological   Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06873)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It addresses the problem of slide-level label bias and dataset bias in multi-instance learning (MIL) for whole-slide image (WSI) classification. The authors argue that existing MIL methods for WSIs are susceptible to biases from the dataset/slides that can lead models to make predictions based on spurious correlations rather than meaningful tissue features. 

- The main hypothesis is that explicitly accounting for these biases and removing their effects via causal intervention will improve model robustness and performance on WSI classification tasks. 

- To test this hypothesis, the authors propose a novel Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL) method. The key idea is to use techniques from causal inference, specifically the backdoor adjustment, to eliminate the effect of confounding factors like slide-level dataset biases. 

- They introduce a structural causal model for the MIL pipeline and use it to guide an intervention approach. The confounders are approximated in an unsupervised fashion and their influence is removed during model training and inference via backdoor adjustment.

- Experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate consistent improvement over state-of-the-art MIL techniques when applying IBMIL, supporting the hypothesis that causal intervention can make MIL models more robust. The proposed approach is general and can empower existing MIL methods.

In summary, this paper hypothesizes that causal intervention can reduce dataset bias effects in MIL-based WSI classification, leading to performance gains, and introduces IBMIL to test this hypothesis. The consistent boosting of multiple MIL techniques provides evidence supporting their hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel scheme called Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL) for whole-slide image classification. 

2. It analyzes the multi-instance learning (MIL) framework through the lens of causality and identifies the issue of "bag contextual prior" which causes spurious correlations between bags and labels.

3. It introduces a causal graph and uses the backdoor adjustment to remove the confounding effect of the bag contextual prior. This allows the model to focus on the true causal relationships between bags and labels. 

4. The proposed IBMIL method is compatible with existing MIL methods for WSIs and can empower them with causal intervention, leading to consistent performance improvements.

5. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IBMIL. It boosts various state-of-the-art MIL methods significantly across different feature extractors and datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of causal intervention to address the bias caused by bag contextual priors in MIL for WSIs. By eliminating this confounder, IBMIL enables existing MIL methods to achieve better generalization. The overall framework and experimental results are solid and demonstrate the utility of this approach.
