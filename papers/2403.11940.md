# [Multistep Inverse Is Not All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11940)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Prior work proposed a "multi-step inverse" method (AC-State) to learn a low-dimensional "control-endogenous" state representation from high-dimensional observations in an MDP. This representation should capture all controllable dynamics but exclude irrelevant, "exogenous" factors. 
- However, the paper identifies cases where AC-State fails, either requiring exponentially more inverse prediction steps than claimed necessary, or failing completely on periodic dynamics.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new method, ACDF, which augments AC-State's multi-step inverse loss with an additional "latent forward model" loss over the learned states. 
- ACDF provably learns an optimal control-endogenous state representation for a very broad class of MDPs, including those with periodic dynamics. It also gives a corrected bound on the number of inverse steps needed.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies fundamental limitations of purely multi-step inverse approaches like AC-State. Shows cases requiring exponentially more history, or where it fails completely.
- Introduces the concepts of "witness distance" and "enhanced exogenous states" to characterize controllable dynamics for analysis.
- Proves that ACDF, combining multi-step inverse and latent forward modeling, provably learns control-endogenous states under general assumptions.
- Empirically demonstrates limitations of AC-State and advantages of ACDF on tabular MDPs and visual navigation tasks.

In summary, the key insight is that supervision from both future observations (via inverse modeling) and immediate transitions (via forward modeling) is necessary and sufficient to extract latent controllable dynamics from irrelevant noise factors. The paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions toward this understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new method called ACDF that improves on the AC-State algorithm for learning control-endogenous latent representations in environments with complex observations, by addressing cases where AC-State fails due to insufficient multi-step inverse prediction or periodic dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is proposing a new algorithm called ACDF that improves upon the prior AC-State method for learning control-endogenous latent state representations. Specifically, ACDF fixes two limitations of AC-State:

1) It corrects the formulation of the number of multistep inverse prediction steps (the parameter K) required for AC-State to work, showing that the previously claimed bound was insufficient. 

2) It augments the multistep inverse loss used by AC-State with an additional latent forward model loss term. This addition enables ACDF to correctly learn representations even in cases of periodic transition dynamics, which AC-State fails on.

The authors prove theoretically that ACDF is guaranteed to learn an optimal control-endogenous latent state representation for a very general class of MDPs. They also demonstrate its improved performance empirically on tabular MDPs and visually-complex gridworld environments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Ex-BMDP (Extended Blind Markov Decision Process) - A formal model for control problems where observations can be factorized into an action-dependent latent state and action-independent noise.

- Control-endogenous latent state - The component of the observation state that evolves deterministically based on actions, representing the controllable aspects of the environment.

- Control-exogenous noise - The component of the observation state that evolves stochastically independently of actions, representing uncontrollable aspects. 

- Encoder - A learned mapping from observations to the control-endogenous latent state representation.

- Multistep inverse dynamics - A method for learning the encoder based on using the encoder outputs at two time steps to predict actions that occurred between those time steps.

- Witness distance - A key theoretical concept quantifying distinguishability of latent states.

- ACDF (Proposed method) - Augments multistep inverse with a latent forward model to provably learn the minimal control-endogenous latent representation.

- Sample efficiency - ACDF demonstrates improved sample efficiency over prior multistep inverse methods in experiments.

- Periodic dynamics - A setting where prior multistep inverse methods fail but ACDF succeeds.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that the witness distance $W(a,b)$ between two endogenous states $a$ and $b$ can be greater than the diameter $D$ of the endogenous dynamics. Explain why this is the case and how it impacts the analysis of the AC-State method. 

2. Explain the role of the "enhanced exogenous encoder" $\bar{\phi}_e^*$ and "enhanced exogenous state" $\bar{\mathcal{E}}^*$ introduced in the paper. When are these representations relevant and what purpose do they serve?

3. The paper proposes adding a latent forward dynamics model to augment the multi-step inverse model of AC-State. Explain why a forward model is necessary in certain cases and how it helps address the limitations identified with a pure multi-step inverse approach.  

4. Lemma 1 shows that the endogenous dynamics of a deterministic, irreducible, and aperiodic Ex-BMDP admit only a trivial encoding up to permutation. Walk through the key steps in the proof of this result. What role does each assumption play?

5. The lower bounds on the number of multi-step inverse steps $K$ required for AC-State and ACDF rely on explicitly constructing hard instances of Ex-BMDPs. Compare and contrast the construction used for each method and explain why more steps are necessary for ACDF.  

6. Discuss the assumptions made about the initial distribution over latent endogenous and exogenous states. Why does the paper avoid assuming independence of these initial states? What are the implications?

7. Explain why adding artificial self-edges, as in Section D.2, fails to produce the correct minimal endogenous state representation. Provide an intuitive explanation of the key issue.  

8. Walk through the proof sketch of why any encoder $\phi'$ minimizing the ACDF loss constitutes a valid endogenous state representation. What is the high-level approach?

9. The paper empirically evaluates ACDF and AC-State on both tabular and high-dimensional Ex-BMDPs. Compare the results. In which environments does ACDF clearly outperform AC-State?

10. What limitations remain in the proposed ACDF method? Can you think of any extensions or open problems for future work based on this paper?
