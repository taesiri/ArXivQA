# [Gaussian-process-regression-based method for the localization of   exceptional points in complex resonance spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05972)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Resonances in open quantum systems can show exceptional points (EPs) where eigenvalues and eigenvectors of two or more resonances coalesce. Precise localization of EPs is challenging, especially in complex systems where computing the spectra is numerically expensive.  
- Existing methods like 3-point or octagon methods use local Taylor expansions around the EP and fail if starting points are not close enough to the EP. They also require many expensive diagonalizations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop an efficient machine learning algorithm based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to find EPs. 
- The GPR model is trained on an initial set of eigenvalue pairs from an EP obtained using a stepwise grouping algorithm. 
- The model provides a first estimate of the EP position via cheap root search. This estimate is iteratively improved by adding selected exact eigenvalue pairs from expensive diagonalizations as new training points.

Key Contributions:
- The stepwise grouping algorithm detects eigenvalue permutations indicating EPs in a dataset and filters out the associated eigenvalues.
- The GPR model interpolation between few expensive training eigenvalue pairs leads to efficient localization of EPs.
- The iterative addition of training data helps convergence from distant starting points with fewer diagonalizations than previous methods.
- The method is developed on toy models and then applied to locate multiple observable EPs in challenging exciton spectra of Cu2O in external electric and magnetic fields.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient GPR-based technique to accurately find EPs in complex quantum systems requiring only few expensive diagonalization steps. The results pave the way for experimental verification of EPs in excitons in Cu2O.
