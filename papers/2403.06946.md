# [Split to Merge: Unifying Separated Modalities for Unsupervised Domain   Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06946)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to apply knowledge learned on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Conventional methods struggle to align features across domains.
- Recent vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show promising zero-shot transfer abilities for UDA. However, most methods focus on adapting either the visual or text modality, overlooking the interplay between modalities. 
- There exists a "modality gap" between vision and text features in VLMs. Adapting one modality loses complementary cues in the other. Some samples are best classified by specific modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Unified Modality Separation (UniMoS) framework to disentangle CLIP's visual features into language-associated (LAC) and vision-associated components (VAC).
- Craft nimble separation networks with orthogonal regularization to ensure discrete representations.
- Propose Modality-Ensemble Training (MET):
    - Knowledge distillation to preserve semantics in LAC.
    - Pseudo-labeling to capture visual patterns in VAC.
    - Dynamic weight generator to assemble modality predictions.
- Align LAC and VAC across domains using a frozen modality discriminator.

Main Contributions:
- Investigate modality gap in VLMs for UDA, revealing limitations of single modality adaptation. 
- Introduce UniMoS framework for effective multimodal adaptation via modality separation and MET.
- Comprehensive analysis shows efficiency of UniMoS in setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks with minimal computational costs.
