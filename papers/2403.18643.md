## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing trajectory planning approaches for autonomous racing vehicles have limitations when used on complex race tracks with elevation changes and banked turns. Specifically, prior approaches using jerk-optimal trajectory generation fail to accurately follow the racing line geometry on complex tracks, resulting in slower lap times. They also only consider 2D tracks, neglecting important 3D effects related to the vertical forces and accelerations that impact the vehicle's dynamics and feasibility of planned trajectories. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper presents a new sampling-based local trajectory planning approach that can maintain the lap time of the racing line even on complex 3D race tracks, while properly accounting for the track's 3D characteristics. Key aspects include:

- A relative trajectory generation method that enables precise tracking of an online-generated time-optimal racing line, while still allowing smooth deviations for overtaking other vehicles. This overcomes limitations of prior jerk-optimal approaches.

- Incorporation of 3D effects via velocity-dependent gg-diagrams that constrain the combined longitudinal and lateral accelerations based on the current vertical acceleration. This ensures dynamic feasibility on banked turns.

- Online replanning of the racing line over a limited spatial horizon from the vehicle's current state, enabling fast reactions to deviations from the line.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrating the suitability limitations of existing jerk-optimal approaches for complex race tracks, and proposing a more capable relative trajectory generation method

- Presenting the first sampling-based racing trajectory planner that accounts for crucial 3D characteristics of the track topography and forces

- Investigating the benefits of online racing line replanning compared to traditional offline computed racing lines, in terms of enabling faster lap times in multi-vehicle scenarios

The proposed approach is evaluated in simulations on a complex 3D hill climb circuit, showing its ability to closely follow the racing line and exploit banked turns unlike the 2D-only planners. Combining the sampling-based planning with online racing line replanning is also shown to lower lap times versus offline racing lines when overtaking is required.
