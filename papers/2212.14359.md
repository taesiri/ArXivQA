# [StyleRes: Transforming the Residuals for Real Image Editing with   StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14359)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve high-fidelity real image inversion with StyleGAN while also enabling high-quality image editing via the learned latent space. 

Specifically, the authors aim to solve the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editability that exists with current GAN inversion methods. Low-dimensional latent codes allow editing but lack expressiveness for detailed reconstruction. Higher-dimensional codes can reconstruct details but don't enable semantic editing.

The main hypothesis is that learning residual features in higher latent codes, along with learning to transform those features based on edits to lower codes, can achieve both high fidelity inversion and editing.

In summary, the key research question is how to get the best of both worlds - high fidelity real image reconstruction and high quality semantic image editing - with a single inversion framework. The core hypothesis is that learning and transforming residual high-rate features conditioned on low-rate edits can achieve this goal.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes a novel image inversion framework called StyleRes to achieve high-fidelity real image inversion as well as high-quality attribute editing using StyleGAN. 

- It learns residual features in higher latent codes to preserve details that lower latent codes fail to capture due to the information bottleneck. This enables high-fidelity reconstruction.

- It learns to transform the residual features based on manipulations in the lower latent codes to enable high-quality editing. 

- It trains the framework with a novel architecture and losses. The architecture learns residuals and transformations with separate encoders. The losses include cycle consistency loss to retain input details during editing.

- It achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of edits, outperforming prior inversion methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

In summary, the key contribution is a new inversion framework with specialized architecture and training approach to address the distortion-editability tradeoff and achieve advances in reconstruction fidelity as well as editing quality over prior works. The cycle consistency loss is a key component that retains input details during editing.
