# [StyleRes: Transforming the Residuals for Real Image Editing with   StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14359)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to achieve high-fidelity real image inversion with StyleGAN while also enabling high-quality image editing via the learned latent space. 

Specifically, the authors aim to solve the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editability that exists with current GAN inversion methods. Low-dimensional latent codes allow editing but lack expressiveness for detailed reconstruction. Higher-dimensional codes can reconstruct details but don't enable semantic editing.

The main hypothesis is that learning residual features in higher latent codes, along with learning to transform those features based on edits to lower codes, can achieve both high fidelity inversion and editing.

In summary, the key research question is how to get the best of both worlds - high fidelity real image reconstruction and high quality semantic image editing - with a single inversion framework. The core hypothesis is that learning and transforming residual high-rate features conditioned on low-rate edits can achieve this goal.
