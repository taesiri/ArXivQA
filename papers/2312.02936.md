# [Drag-A-Video: Non-rigid Video Editing with Point-based Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02936)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Drag-A-Video, the first framework for interactive, point-based non-rigid video editing using diffusion models. The key idea is to allow users to simply click pairs of handle points and target points on the first frame of a video to indicate desired edits. The framework then propagates these points across frames and alternates between optimizing the diffusion latents to move handle points towards targets and updating handle point positions for temporal consistency. Specifically, the contributions include: (1) a point set propagation method that expands handle points into deformable grids for robustness; (2) a video-level motion supervision loss for latent optimization that accumulates gradients across frames; (3) multi-timestep latent optimization with learnable offsets for better editability; (4) a temporal-consistent point tracking module. Both quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate high-quality editing with temporal coherence. The framework facilitates precise spatial control over video content while maintaining temporal dynamics. Limitations include issues with occlusions and lack of 3D understanding. Overall, Drag-A-Video represents an impactful advancement of diffusion models to interactive video editing tasks.
