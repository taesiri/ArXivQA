# [Interpretable Mechanistic Representations for Meal-level Glycemic   Control in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03344)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel hybrid variational autoencoder (VAE) model that learns interpretable and robust representations of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and self-reported meals. The key innovation is grounding the latent space of the VAE in the parameters and states of a physiologically-based mechanistic model of glucose-insulin dynamics. This imposes useful inductive biases while retaining flexibility to handle imperfect real-world data. Specifically, the encoder inferrs an "effective" meal glucose appearance rate to make the mechanistic decoder robust to inaccurate self-reported meals. When applied to a dataset of CGMs and meals from individuals with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, the model separates disease severity despite no access to diagnoses. The learned 2D embedding space aligns with medical understanding, with higher basal glucose, longer post-meal elevation durations, and lower insulin sensitivity for more severe diabetes. Quantitatively, the model's patient embeddings produce 2-4x higher clustering scores compared to various baselines. By combining interpretability and applicability to in-the-wild data, this hybrid modeling approach could enable meal-level comparisons of glycemic control to advance applications like personalized nutrition and patient monitoring.
