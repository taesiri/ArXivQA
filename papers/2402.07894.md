# [MODIPHY: Multimodal Obscured Detection for IoT using PHantom   Convolution-Enabled Faster YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Low light conditions and occlusion impede object detection in real-world IoT applications like autonomous vehicles and security systems. 
- Advanced machine learning models have high computational demands which clash with resource constraints of devices, hampering real-time performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce "YOLO Phantom", one of the smallest YOLO models, that utilizes a novel Phantom Convolution block.
- Achieves comparable accuracy to latest YOLOv8n while reducing parameters by 43% and model size significantly. 
- Leverages transfer learning on a multimodal RGB-infrared dataset to address low-light and occlusion issues.
- Tailored for resource-constrained IoT devices with substantial speed improvements for real-time detection.

Main Contributions:
- Creation of a very compact YOLO model with 50% fewer kernels in some layers, showing superior speed without loss of accuracy.

- Introduction of YOLO Phantom capable of detecting RGB and thermal modalities, trained on multimodal data to handle low light and occlusion.

- Proposing an innovative "Phantom Convolution" block using Depthwise Separable Convolution and Group Convolution to create a faster and more efficient version of Ghost Convolution.

- Realization of an end-to-end system with a Raspberry Pi setup with RGB and infrared cameras, AWS cloud connectivity for real-time notifications on detected objects.

In summary, the paper presents YOLO Phantom, an optimized compact YOLO model for multimodal low light object detection that is fast, accurate and engineered for resource-constrained IoT devices through a combination of architectural improvements to YOLO and a novel convolution block.
