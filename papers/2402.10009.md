# [Zero-Shot Unsupervised and Text-Based Audio Editing Using DDPM Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10009)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent progress in text-based image generation and editing using diffusion models has not yet extended to the audio domain. Existing audio editing methods either require training task-specific models from scratch or expensive test-time optimization. The goal is to explore zero-shot editing techniques for audio using pre-trained diffusion models, including both text-based editing as done in images, and discovering meaningful unsupervised editing directions without any text guidance.

Methods: 
Two key techniques are presented:

1) Text-based audio editing: Adopted from images, this extracts noise vectors corresponding to an input audio signal using edit-friendly DDPM inversion. To generate the edited signal, the noise vectors are used in reverse diffusion while conditioning the model on a text prompt describing the desired edit. A balance is controlled between adhering to the text vs remaining faithful to the original structure.

2) Unsupervised editing: Here principal components (PCs) of the diffusion posterior are computed, which uncover dominant modes of uncertainty in the denoising process. Adding/subtracting these PCs during diffusion exposes semantic editing directions. For music, this creates improvisations by changing melody while retaining style/rhythm.

Both methods leverage the pre-trained AudioLDM2 model. For evaluation, text editing is compared to SDEdit and MusicGen on a new prompts dataset. Unsupervised editing is compared to SDEdit and random perturbations.

Contributions:
- First exploration of zero-shot audio editing techniques akin to recent image methods
- New unsupervised approach to find editing directions based on diffusion posterior uncertainty  
- State-of-the-art text-based audio editing, superior adherence to text while remaining faithful to structure
- Musically interesting edits like melody improvisation and control over specific instruments

The methods enable creative editing of audio signals without needing to train task-specific models. Both text-based and unsupervised techniques expose meaningful ways to manipulate existing sounds.
