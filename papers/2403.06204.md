# [Identifying and interpreting non-aligned human conceptual   representations using language modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06204)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The question of whether personal life experience shapes how people represent the meanings of common words (like "see", "touch", "learn") is longstanding but hard to study empirically. 
- Prior work has used similarity ratings, feature listings, etc but these require subjective interpretation and can't formally quantify differences in conceptual representation.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a supervised representational alignment method with two steps:
   1) Supervised feature pruning of a language model (GloVe) to identify subsets that optimize prediction of similarity judgments for blind vs sighted
   2) Linear probing analysis to interpret the latent semantics of the retained feature subsets by mapping them to interpretable semantic dimensions
- Apply this method to study impact of blindness on representation of 7 verb categories: motion, sight, touch, light emission, animate sounds, inanimate sounds, knowledge acquisition

Main Contributions:
- First computational demonstration that blindness causes conceptual reorganization for both sensory-related words and abstract words
- Identified specific semantic shifts blind associate more strongly with motion verbs (social, cognitive meanings) and sounds (mental state meanings)
- Introduced a general computational approach to study interindividual differences in word meaning quantitatively and interpret the bases for those differences
- Showed that modular subspaces of word embeddings, described by limited feature subsets, can effectively characterize the geometry of human semantic categories
- Demonstrated usefulness of supervised pruning and probing tasks for comparing representations across groups without requiring the same materials to have been rated

The key insight is using computational modeling to not just detect representational differences statistically, but also interpret the specific conceptual divergences quantitatively. This opens up new ways to study the impact of experience on cognition using behavioral methods paired with machine learning tools.
