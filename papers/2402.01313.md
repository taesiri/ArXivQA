# [AutoGCN -- Towards Generic Human Activity Recognition with Neural   Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01313)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Human activity recognition (HAR) using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has shown promising results recently. However, most GCN methods are crafted by domain experts in a trial-and-error process for specific datasets, limiting their applicability and requiring extensive expertise. 

- Neural architecture search (NAS) can automate model building but has scarcely been applied to skeleton-based HAR GCNs. Existing NAS methods have limitations in search spaces, input representations, and search algorithms.

Proposed Solution - AutoGCN:

- The paper proposes AutoGCN, a novel NAS algorithm to automatically construct high-performing GCN architectures for HAR in a dataset-agnostic way. 

Main Contributions:

- Formulates a comprehensive search space with diverse components and hyperparameter ranges to enhance network expressiveness.

- Introduces a balanced search algorithm using a replay memory to optimize exploration/exploitation behavior.

- Develops a rich skeletal input representation incorporating position, velocity, bone, and acceleration features.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale skeleton HAR datasets, outperforming conventional NAS and random search.

- Demonstrates AutoGCN's ability to find diverse well-performing architectures adapted to different evaluation criteria.

In summary, AutoGCN pushes the boundaries of automatically designing high-quality skeleton-based HAR models in a generic, expert-knowledge-free way via NAS. By carefully constructing the search space, search algorithm and input representation, it sets a new state-of-the-art for this task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

AutoGCN is a novel neural architecture search framework for automatically constructing optimal graph convolutional network architectures for human activity recognition from skeleton data by simultaneously searching over both hyperparameters and architectural components within a comprehensive search space using a reinforcement learning controller and knowledge reservoir to balance exploration and exploitation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A generic approach to construct a GCN architecture for human activity recognition (HAR) with neural architecture search (NAS), which can concurrently optimize hyperparameters and the architecture. Additionally, it can be applied to different datasets within HAR and performs better than random search and other NAS procedures for GCNs.

2. An update mechanism incorporating a knowledge reservoir to balance exploration and exploitation during the search process, leading to an accelerated and efficient search procedure while ensuring optimal exploration behavior. 

3. A diverse search space construction that enables the usage of different input representations to further enhance the network performance and generalizability.

In summary, the paper proposes a NAS algorithm called AutoGCN that can automatically design high-performing and customizable GCN architectures for skeleton-based human activity recognition. Key aspects include optimizing hyperparameters and architecture concurrently, using a knowledge reservoir to guide the search, and leveraging different input representations. Experiments show AutoGCN outperforms other NAS and GCN methods.
