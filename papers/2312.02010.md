# [Towards Learning a Generalist Model for Embodied Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02010)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed yet concise summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes NaviLLM, the first generalist model for embodied navigation that adapts Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable a diverse spectrum of capabilities. NaviLLM unifies various tasks into a single model via schema-based instruction, allowing it to harness multi-task data. Experiments demonstrate NaviLLM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks like CVDN, SOON and ScanQA with one unified model. Significantly, it obtains 29% higher goal progress on CVDN over previous best methods. NaviLLM also exhibits strong generalization - when tested on unseen tasks like embodied question answering or 3D captioning, it still produces impressive results. The method mitigates overfitting to specific datasets via pre-trained LLMs and schema flexibility. By expanding data diversity, NaviLLM enhances navigation capabilities across varying instructions and environments. The single generalist model thus attains excellent comprehension and language generation abilities crucial for embodied navigation. In summary, the proposed approach shows significant potential for learning capable and generalizable embodied agents.
