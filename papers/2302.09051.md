Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper provides a comprehensive survey of language model hybrid architectures for answering complex questions. The authors first discuss required skills for complex question answering, including interpreting input, retrieval, inference, world modeling, decomposition, and experience learning. They also outline common tasks like integrated QA, decomposition, and leveraging external modules. Key limitations of current language models are analyzed, including bias, scalability, reasoning, alignment to human values, hallucination, multimodal capabilities, and data sensitivity. The paper then reviews strategies for evaluating, training, hybridizing, prompting, and reinforcing language models to overcome limitations and answer complex questions. Evaluation metrics, costs functions, and datasets are covered. Training methods like pre-training, fine-tuning, parameter-efficient tuning, and improvement techniques are explored. Architectural patterns for hybridizing language models are proposed and classified, such as connecting the model with task heads, prompt tuning modules, decomposers, retrievers, reasoning modules, and human feedback loops. Prompting strategies are analyzed to optimize problem solving in a single pass or through multi-step optimization and process optimization. Finally, reinforcement techniques like reward-based learning, imitation learning, and human-in-the-loop are discussed to continually improve language models. Key remaining challenges around hallucination, costs, data availability, multi-sensitivity, decomposition, and explainability are highlighted as active research frontiers.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a hybrid neural network architecture for complex question answering. The key components of the method are:- A large pre-trained language model (LLM) based on a transformer architecture like BERT or GPT-3. This provides a strong foundation for language understanding and generation.- Additional modules connected to the LLM to enhance specific skills like question decomposition, reasoning, retrieval, and human alignment. These include prompt tuning modules, semantic search engines, solvers, and reinforcement learning components. - Techniques like prompting and reinforcement learning to better adapt the LLM to complex QA without full retraining. Prompting provides context and instructions, while reinforcement learning aligns the LLM with human expectations.- A decomposition approach to break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions that can be addressed by the LLM and other modules. This enables multi-hop reasoning over retrieved information.- Evaluation metrics and datasets tailored to complex QA to assess performance on accuracy, robustness, calibration, fairness and efficiency.In summary, the paper proposes combining a large pre-trained LLM with specialized modules and strategies to enable more complex reasoning and multi-step question answering aligned with human expectations. The hybrid architecture aims to leverage the strengths of LLMs while overcoming their limitations.
