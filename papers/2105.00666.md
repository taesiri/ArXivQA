# [Unsupervised Document Expansion for Information Retrieval with   Stochastic Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00666)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be:

How can we expand document representations for information retrieval in an unsupervised manner to mitigate the vocabulary mismatch problem? 

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By stochastically generating multiple sentences that are relevant to a document using a pre-trained language model, and augmenting the original document with these generated sentences, the document representation can be enriched to improve retrieval performance without requiring supervised query-document pairs for training.

In summary, the central research question is how to do unsupervised document expansion to address vocabulary mismatch in IR, and the main hypothesis is that generating multiple relevant sentences stochastically with a pre-trained LM can achieve this effectively. The authors propose the UDEG framework to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing a novel unsupervised document expansion framework called UDEG (Unsupervised Document Expansion with Generation) that generates additional sentences to augment documents and enrich their representations, without needing query-document training pairs. 

2. Using a pre-trained language model within UDEG to generate relevant sentences for a given document. The sentences are generated stochastically via Monte Carlo dropout to create diverse outputs.

3. Demonstrating that UDEG achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard IR benchmark datasets (ANTIQUE and MS MARCO) across various evaluation metrics, outperforming relevant query and document expansion baselines.

4. Providing analysis showing UDEG's stochastic generation scheme significantly improves performance compared to deterministic generation, and that the framework does not depend on a specific language model. 

5. Conducting a case study indicating UDEG's generated sentences contain novel yet relevant terms that help with term re-weighting and alleviating vocabulary mismatch issues in ad-hoc retrieval.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing and validating a novel unsupervised document expansion framework called UDEG that can improve IR system performance by generating diverse relevant text to augment document representations, without needing query-document training data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel unsupervised document expansion framework called UDEG that generates diverse supplementary sentences for a document using a pre-trained language model with stochastic perturbation, in order to enrich document representation and improve information retrieval performance without needing query-document training pairs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of document expansion for information retrieval:

- The main contribution is proposing an unsupervised document expansion framework (UDEG) that generates additional sentences to augment documents, without needing query-document training data. This makes it more flexible than prior supervised approaches for document expansion.

- The idea of using abstractive text generation with a pre-trained language model (PEGASUS) allows generating novel words beyond just extracting keywords, which helps with the vocabulary mismatch problem. This goes beyond prior extractive techniques like LexRank.

- Stochastically generating multiple sentences with Monte Carlo dropout is a novel way to create diverse expansions. This differs from prior work that may generate only a single static expansion. 

- Comprehensive experiments on two IR benchmarks (ANTIQUE and MS MARCO datasets) demonstrate sizable improvements over various baselines. The gains are consistent across different retrieval models and evaluation metrics. This provides strong empirical evidence for the benefits of the UDEG framework.

- The analysis offers insights into which model design choices contribute to improved performance, such as abstractive over extractive generation, and stochastic generation for diversity. The case studies also illustrate how UDEG helps with term re-weighting and vocabulary mismatch issues.

- The approach does not seem to require re-training or fine-tuning the language model, making it easy to apply. The framework also appears model-agnostic, given the comparable results with PEGASUS vs BART.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel unsupervised document expansion technique using pre-trained language models and stochastic generation. The comprehensive experiments and analyses provide convincing evidence of its effectiveness for information retrieval. The ideas seem generalizable and offer a practical way to improve IR systems without needing query-document training data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other stochastic generation strategies besides Monte Carlo dropout and top-k sampling. The authors found Monte Carlo dropout to be more effective, but believe there may be other promising approaches.

- Experimenting with different numbers of generated sentences for expansion. The authors showed performance tends to improve with more sentences, but gains saturated after 4-5 sentences. More work could be done to find the optimal amount. 

- Applying the UDEG framework to other IR tasks like polysemy resolution. The authors suggest their method of generating diverse relevant text could help with other vocabulary mismatch issues beyond just synonyms.

- Testing the approach on scientific/scholarly datasets. The authors believe their unsupervised expansion method could benefit IR systems targeting academic content.

- Incorporating semantic similarity metrics into the expansion process, rather than just lexical diversity metrics. This could improve relevance of generated text.

- Exploring generative models beyond BART and PEGASUS. The authors found the framework robust across these two models, but believe other models may offer further gains.

- Studying the model's behavior on longer input documents, or methods to select key sentences to expand rather than full documents.

In summary, the authors see promise in stochastic generative expansion models for IR, and suggest numerous ways to build on their work studying different generation approaches, optimizing the expansion process, and applying the framework to new settings/tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a novel framework called Unsupervised Document Expansion with Generation (UDEG) for improving information retrieval performance by expanding document representations. The key idea is to use a pre-trained language model to stochastically generate multiple sentences that are relevant to a given document. These generated sentences are then appended to the original document to create an expanded representation that is more expressive and contains a richer vocabulary. Experiments on two IR benchmark datasets, ANTIQUE and MS MARCO, demonstrate that UDEG significantly outperforms relevant expansion baselines across multiple evaluation metrics. The results show that the abstractive generation scheme and stochastic perturbation for creating diverse sentences both contribute substantially to the performance gains. Overall, UDEG provides an effective approach to document expansion that does not rely on any query-document training data. By generating novel but relevant terms, it helps alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem and improves retrieval for unseen queries.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called Unsupervised Document Expansion with Generation (UDEG) for improving information retrieval performance. The key idea is to expand documents by generating additional sentences related to the document content, without requiring any labeled query-document pairs for training. 

First, the UDEG framework uses a pre-trained language model to generate sentences that summarize or paraphrase the original document. To increase diversity, it stochastically perturbs the embeddings and generates multiple versions of sentences. These additional generated sentences are then appended to the original document before indexing. Experiments on two standard IR benchmark datasets show that UDEG significantly outperforms relevant baseline methods on various evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the unsupervised abstractive generation scheme with stochastic perturbation for document expansion. A detailed analysis also reveals that the lexical diversity of the generated sentences is crucial for the performance gains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised framework for document expansion called UDEG (Unsupervised Document Expansion with Generation). The key idea is to expand documents by generating additional sentences that are relevant to the document's content, in order to enrich the document representation. This is done by first using a pre-trained language model fine-tuned on summarization data to generate a sentence summarizing the document's key information. To generate multiple diverse sentences, they apply stochastic perturbation to the language model embeddings using Monte Carlo dropout during inference. The stochastically generated sentences are then concatenated to the original document before indexing. By expanding documents in this unsupervised manner, they are able to improve various IR evaluation metrics without needing any query-document pairs for training. The main novelty lies in the abstractive stochastic generation of supplementary sentences to expand document representations.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the paper is addressing is the vocabulary mismatch problem in information retrieval. Specifically:

- In information retrieval, there can be a mismatch between the words used in a query and the words used in relevant documents. This makes it hard for sparse term-based retrieval models like BM25 and query likelihood to match the query to relevant documents. 

- The paper proposes a method called Unsupervised Document Expansion with Generation (UDEG) to address this vocabulary mismatch problem by expanding documents with additional generated sentences containing novel but relevant words. 

- The UDEG framework generates these additional sentences using a pre-trained language model, without needing any labeled query-document pairs for training. 

- To generate more diverse relevant sentences, the paper further proposes a stochastic generation scheme by perturbing the embeddings fed into the language model.

- Experiments on two IR benchmark datasets show UDEG outperforms other expansion baselines, demonstrating it can alleviate the vocabulary mismatch issue and improve retrieval performance.

In summary, the key problem is vocabulary mismatch in IR, and the paper proposes an unsupervised document expansion approach using stochastic text generation to introduce more relevant terms and improve retrieval.
