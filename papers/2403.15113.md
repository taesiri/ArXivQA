# [Set-membership target search and tracking within an unknown cluttered   area using cooperating UAVs equipped with vision systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15113)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of cooperative search, acquisition and tracking (CSAT) of multiple moving ground targets by a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in an unknown and cluttered environment. The challenges include:

- Representing the unknown environment and detecting the presence of obstacles that can occlude targets
- Exploiting the limited information provided by onboard computer vision systems (CVS) to reliably detect and locate targets 
- Estimating target locations and planning UAV trajectories to balance exploration of unseen areas and tracking of identified targets

Solution:
The paper proposes a distributed set-membership approach. The key aspects are:

- Hypotheses to interpret information from the CVS including depth maps, image labels and bounding boxes to get bounded-error measurements
- Estimating guaranteed sets containing identified target locations by fusing CVS information  
- Characterizing parts of the free space and occluded areas using image labels and depth maps 
- A distributed model predictive control scheme for each UAV to cooperatively minimize estimated uncertainty 

Contributions:

- Novel set-membership approach directly exploiting realistic CVS information for CSAT in unknown environments
- Introducing assumptions on CVS outputs to obtain bounded-error measurements usable in set-membership estimation
- Estimating guaranteed target location sets, free space and occluded areas from raw CVS data
- Distributed control scheme balancing exploration and tracking reducing target location uncertainty  

The performance is demonstrated via simulations in a simplified urban environment using a realistic CVS model. The estimation errors for identified target locations are small. Almost all of the environment is searched, showing the exploration capability. The limitations in tracking around obstacles are discussed and future enhancements identified.
