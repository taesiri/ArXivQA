# [ACL-SPC: Adaptive Closed-Loop system for Self-Supervised Point Cloud   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01979)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform point cloud completion in a self-supervised manner using only a single partial input point cloud. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel self-supervised framework called ACL-SPC to complete partial point clouds without requiring any ground truth data or multiple views of an object. 

The key hypotheses are:

- An adaptive closed-loop (ACL) system can be developed to enforce output consistency for input variations and enable self-supervised learning for point cloud completion using a single partial observation.

- Defining appropriate self-supervised loss functions like a consistency loss and weighted Chamfer loss can train the ACL system to generate complete point clouds from partial inputs without any supervision.

- The proposed ACL-SPC framework can achieve comparable or better performance than previous unsupervised methods and generalize better to real-world datasets than supervised methods trained on synthetic data.

So in summary, this paper focuses on self-supervised point cloud completion from single partial inputs, proposes a novel ACL framework and loss functions for this task, and hypothesizes the method can outperform previous approaches. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.
