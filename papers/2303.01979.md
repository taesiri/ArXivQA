# [ACL-SPC: Adaptive Closed-Loop system for Self-Supervised Point Cloud   Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01979)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform point cloud completion in a self-supervised manner using only a single partial input point cloud. Specifically, the paper proposes a novel self-supervised framework called ACL-SPC to complete partial point clouds without requiring any ground truth data or multiple views of an object. 

The key hypotheses are:

- An adaptive closed-loop (ACL) system can be developed to enforce output consistency for input variations and enable self-supervised learning for point cloud completion using a single partial observation.

- Defining appropriate self-supervised loss functions like a consistency loss and weighted Chamfer loss can train the ACL system to generate complete point clouds from partial inputs without any supervision.

- The proposed ACL-SPC framework can achieve comparable or better performance than previous unsupervised methods and generalize better to real-world datasets than supervised methods trained on synthetic data.

So in summary, this paper focuses on self-supervised point cloud completion from single partial inputs, proposes a novel ACL framework and loss functions for this task, and hypothesizes the method can outperform previous approaches. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes ACL-SPC, the first self-supervised method for point cloud completion using only a single partial point cloud as input. 

- It develops an adaptive closed-loop (ACL) system to enable self-supervised learning for point cloud completion. The ACL system enforces consistency such that the network generates the same complete point cloud output for different synthetic partial inputs generated from an initial output.

- It designs effective self-supervised loss functions, including a consistency loss and weighted Chamfer distance loss, to train the model without any supervision.

- It demonstrates through experiments that the proposed ACL-SPC method achieves comparable or superior performance to unsupervised methods on synthetic and real datasets, and outperforms supervised methods trained on synthetic data when evaluated on real datasets.

- It performs ablation studies that validate the importance of the different components of the proposed method, including the loss functions and number of synthesized partial inputs.

In summary, the key innovation is the development of a self-supervised framework using an adaptive closed-loop system and consistency enforcement that can learn to complete point clouds from only a single partial observation without any other supervision or prior information. This represents an important step towards more practical point cloud completion.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper proposes a novel self-supervised method for point cloud completion called ACL-SPC. Here are the key ways it compares to other related works:

- It is the first fully self-supervised method for point cloud completion that requires only a single partial input point cloud, without any other supervision like multi-view consistency or unpaired complete point clouds. This makes it more practical for real-world applications compared to previous unsupervised methods. 

- It introduces a novel adaptive closed-loop (ACL) system to enforce output consistency for varying inputs. This ACL framework allows training on just single partial inputs in a self-supervised manner.

- It achieves results competitive with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on synthetic datasets, even without multi-view supervision they rely on. On real datasets, it outperforms supervised methods trained on synthetic data.

- While prior works focused on particular object categories that have complete point clouds in synthetic datasets, this method can train on arbitrary real incomplete data.

- The designed consistency loss function is key to enabling training with single partial inputs and improving coverage of missing regions.

Overall, this paper pushes the boundaries of point cloud completion into a more practical self-supervised setting. The proposed ACL system and losses allow training with only single real scans, eliminating the need for multi-view consistency, complete point supervision, or cross-domain training. The results are competitive or better than prior arts across synthetic and real datasets. This represents an important step towards point completion in real-world applications.
