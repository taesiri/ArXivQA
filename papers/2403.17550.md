# [DeepMIF: Deep Monotonic Implicit Fields for Large-Scale LiDAR 3D Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17550)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large-scale 3D mapping using LiDAR sensors faces fundamental limitations in producing dense and complete 3D scene reconstructions due to sparse and noisy measurements. 
- Directly fitting neural implicits along raw LiDAR rays suffers from view-inconsistency and conflicts between measurements. This leads to noisy and incomplete mapping results.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a new scene representation called "Monotonic Implicit Field (MIF)" suitable for LiDAR-based 3D mapping.
- MIF is a non-metric field that satisfies: (1) Zero at surface points  (2) Positive outside, negative inside shape (3) Monotonically non-increasing along each LiDAR ray.
- Design learning system to optimize MIF by enforcing monotonicity loss along rays. Integrate hierarchical latent grid and adaptive sampling.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel monotonic implicit field (MIF) representation for robust large-scale LiDAR mapping. More suitable than SDF representations.
- Learning system to optimize MIF using monotonicity loss and hierarchical latent grid.
- Achieves high quality 3D mapping on Mai City, Newer College and KITTI datasets. Outperforms depth fusion, interpolation, completion and recent learning methods.

In summary, the paper proposes a new monotonic implicit field representation and learning system to address limitations of existing methods for large-scale LiDAR mapping. The key innovation is using a monotonicity constraint along LiDAR rays instead of directly fitting the noisy sensor data. Experiments demonstrate the approach achieves improved 3D mapping performance.
