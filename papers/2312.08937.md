# [BiPFT: Binary Pre-trained Foundation Transformer with Low-rank   Estimation of Binarization Residual Polynomials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08937)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes the first Binary Pretrained Foundation Transformer (BiPFT) for natural language understanding tasks. BiPFT remarkably saves 56× operations and 28× memory compared to full-precision models by using 1-bit weights and activations. In contrast to previous task-specific binary transformers that rely heavily on distillation and hyperparameter tuning, BiPFT exhibits much enhanced learning capabilities and stability, enabling straightforward finetuning on downstream tasks. Specifically, the authors first build a strong binary transformer baseline and analyze its weaknesses including unreliability to hyperparameters and over-reliance on task-specific distillation. They then propose to pretrain the binary foundation model using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction objectives. Experiments show BiPFT significantly outperforms the binary baseline and rivals full-precision BERT. Furthermore, a data-driven binarization method is introduced to model the residual errors during binarization using low-rank estimators. This further improves BiPFT's performance. Extensive analyses demonstrate BiPFT's effectiveness, including improved optimization efficiency, reduced dependence on distillation, and better generalization across tasks. The released binary foundation model and code simplify future deployment of binary transformers.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling up foundation transformers for maximal task-agnostic knowledge brings computational challenges, especially on resource-limited devices like mobiles. How to get a compact pretrained foundation model that can work on mobiles is an important problem.

- Existing binary transformers rely on task-specific distillation and hyperparameter tuning, have unstable optimization, and weak learning capabilities without the full-precision teacher model.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose the first Binary Pretrained Foundation Transformer (BiPFT) with a BERT-like architecture that is pretrained on masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks.

- A task-agnostic distillation loss is added during pretraining to speed up convergence. This doesn't complicate the downstream finetuning pipeline.

- Analyze the binarization error in self-attention and model the residual polynomials using low-rank estimators. This further enhances the BiPFT.

Main Contributions:

- First binary pretrained foundation model that bridges the training gap between full-precision and binary transformers. Enables straightforward finetuning for downstream tasks.

- Propose data-driven binarization by estimating binarization residual polynomials using low-rank estimators. More accurate binary self-attention.  

- BiPFT saves 56x operations and 28x memory compared to full-precision BERT with comparable performance. Simplifies training pipeline.

- Extensive experiments show BiPFT surpasses task-specific baseline by 15.4% on GLUE. More robust to hyperparameters. Reduced reliance on downstream distillation. Generalizes well to various NLU tasks.
