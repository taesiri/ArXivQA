# [Non-Contrastive Unsupervised Learning of Physiological Signals from   Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07944)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform unsupervised learning of physiological signals, specifically blood volume pulse, from video data without ground truth labels. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Weak assumptions of periodicity and finite bandwidth are sufficient for discovering the blood volume pulse signal in video data in a completely unsupervised manner.

2. Encouraging sparse power spectra within normal physiological bandlimits and variance over batches of power spectra is enough to learn robust visual features corresponding to periodic physiological signals.

3. This non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework can enable the discovery of subtle periodic signals like pulse rate from unlabeled video data.

In summary, the paper explores unsupervised learning of physiological signals like pulse rate by relying only on signal priors like periodicity and bandwidth constraints, without the need for any ground truth labels. This is in contrast to existing supervised and contrastive self-supervised methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework called SiNC for estimating physiological signals like blood volume pulse directly from unlabeled video data. The key points are:

- It is the first non-contrastive unsupervised learning method for camera-based vitals measurement, breaking free from the need for paired ground truth signals during training.

- It uses simple loss functions in the frequency domain that encourage sparse power spectra within expected physiological bandlimits and variance over batches. 

- It demonstrates the ability to train accurate pulse rate estimators using non-rPPG specific videos without ground truth vitals labels. 

- The limited inductive biases make it capable of discovering other periodic physiological signals beyond just pulse rate.

In summary, the main contribution is a general unsupervised learning framework for physiological signal regression that only requires unlabeled video data and loose frequency constraints. This enables scaling deep learning for camera-based vitals estimation without reliance on paired ground truth data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework for discovering periodic physiological signals like pulse rate from video by leveraging signal priors like bandlimits and sparsity in the frequency domain, and shows it can be trained on unlabeled video to match or exceed supervised methods.
