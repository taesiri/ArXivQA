# [Non-Contrastive Unsupervised Learning of Physiological Signals from   Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07944)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform unsupervised learning of physiological signals, specifically blood volume pulse, from video data without ground truth labels. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Weak assumptions of periodicity and finite bandwidth are sufficient for discovering the blood volume pulse signal in video data in a completely unsupervised manner.

2. Encouraging sparse power spectra within normal physiological bandlimits and variance over batches of power spectra is enough to learn robust visual features corresponding to periodic physiological signals.

3. This non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework can enable the discovery of subtle periodic signals like pulse rate from unlabeled video data.

In summary, the paper explores unsupervised learning of physiological signals like pulse rate by relying only on signal priors like periodicity and bandwidth constraints, without the need for any ground truth labels. This is in contrast to existing supervised and contrastive self-supervised methods.
