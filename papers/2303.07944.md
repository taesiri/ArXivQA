# [Non-Contrastive Unsupervised Learning of Physiological Signals from   Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07944)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform unsupervised learning of physiological signals, specifically blood volume pulse, from video data without ground truth labels. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Weak assumptions of periodicity and finite bandwidth are sufficient for discovering the blood volume pulse signal in video data in a completely unsupervised manner.

2. Encouraging sparse power spectra within normal physiological bandlimits and variance over batches of power spectra is enough to learn robust visual features corresponding to periodic physiological signals.

3. This non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework can enable the discovery of subtle periodic signals like pulse rate from unlabeled video data.

In summary, the paper explores unsupervised learning of physiological signals like pulse rate by relying only on signal priors like periodicity and bandwidth constraints, without the need for any ground truth labels. This is in contrast to existing supervised and contrastive self-supervised methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework called SiNC for estimating physiological signals like blood volume pulse directly from unlabeled video data. The key points are:

- It is the first non-contrastive unsupervised learning method for camera-based vitals measurement, breaking free from the need for paired ground truth signals during training.

- It uses simple loss functions in the frequency domain that encourage sparse power spectra within expected physiological bandlimits and variance over batches. 

- It demonstrates the ability to train accurate pulse rate estimators using non-rPPG specific videos without ground truth vitals labels. 

- The limited inductive biases make it capable of discovering other periodic physiological signals beyond just pulse rate.

In summary, the main contribution is a general unsupervised learning framework for physiological signal regression that only requires unlabeled video data and loose frequency constraints. This enables scaling deep learning for camera-based vitals estimation without reliance on paired ground truth data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a new non-contrastive unsupervised learning framework for discovering periodic physiological signals like pulse rate from video by leveraging signal priors like bandlimits and sparsity in the frequency domain, and shows it can be trained on unlabeled video to match or exceed supervised methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key comparisons between this paper and other related work in unsupervised remote photoplethysmography (rPPG):

- This paper presents the first non-contrastive unsupervised learning approach for rPPG, while prior unsupervised rPPG methods have relied on contrastive learning frameworks. The non-contrastive approach avoids issues with constructing precise negative pairs.

- The proposed SiNC framework uses simple frequency priors and losses applied directly to model predictions, avoiding complex pairwise/triplet comparisons needed in contrastive learning.

- The paper demonstrates the first successful training of rPPG models using non-rPPG face video datasets that lack ground truth pulse labels, showing the flexibility of the method.

- The approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to supervised methods on common rPPG benchmarks. It outperforms prior contrastive unsupervised rPPG techniques.

- While most prior work focuses on discovering rPPG from face video, the general framework could extend to other periodic physiological signals like respiration rate from video.

- A limitation is the failure to learn rPPG from large-scale but compressed YouTube videos. This highlights the sensitivity of subtle rPPG signals to video compression.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions demonstrating the viability of non-contrastive unsupervised learning for rPPG and the ability to leverage unlabeled natural video datasets. The simple yet effective framework could enable scaling rPPG and other camera-based vitals measurement.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Apply the SiNC framework to discover other physiological signals from video beyond pulse rate, such as respiration rate. The authors state their framework could be theoretically capable of this given the limited inductive biases.

- Improve performance on more challenging datasets like DDPM by incorporating dataset-specific priors or losses. The performance on DDPM lagged behind the other datasets.

- Use the unsupervised learning approach with larger and more diverse video datasets. The authors tried this with CelebV-HQ but ran into issues due to compression lowering the pulse signal quality.

- Experiment with different model architectures beyond the 3D CNN they used. They suggest some popular architectures like DeepPhys may not be well-suited.

- Apply the unsupervised approach to other signal regression tasks beyond remote photoplethysmography. The authors believe their approach generalizes well to other problems involving periodic or quasi-periodic signals.

- Investigate how to leverage unlabeled video more effectively. The authors found success using non-rPPG face videos, but there may be ways to incorporate even weaker forms of supervision.

- Combine supervised, unsupervised, and synthetic data. The authors suggest combining all three sources could produce the most robust models.

In summary, the main directions are applying SiNC to new tasks/signals, using larger/diverse video datasets, trying new model architectures, and combining multiple data sources. The overarching goal is to move beyond the constraints of small labeled rPPG datasets.
