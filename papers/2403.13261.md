# [Self-Supervised Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Spatial and   Temporal Consistency Regularizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13261)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Class-agnostic motion prediction aims to predict the motion of the entire point cloud scene rather than individual objects. It provides a backup to object-level trajectory prediction and is crucial for autonomous driving systems. Existing methods rely on full supervision with manual point cloud annotations or additional modalities like images, which limits their applicability. The potential benefits inherent in point cloud sequences are still underexplored for self-supervised learning of motion prediction.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a self-supervised approach to train a motion prediction model using only unlabeled LiDAR sequences. It has three main components:

1) Pseudo label generation: An optimal transport solver matches points between current and future point clouds to establish coarse correspondence as pseudo labels for supervision.  

2) Cluster consistency regularization: A spatial loss encourages consistent motion prediction within rigid object clusters in the scene.  

3) Temporal consistency regularization: A forward consistency loss smooths predictions over time. A backward consistency loss penalizes predictions that violate forward-backward motion symmetry, acting as self-supervision.

Main Contributions:
- A self-supervised framework to train motion prediction models without any manual annotations, using only LiDAR sequences.

- Introduction of cluster consistency, forward consistency and backward consistency losses that enable learning from inaccurate pseudo labels.

- State-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods on nuScenes dataset, reducing the gap to supervised approaches substantially.

The method explores spatial and temporal structure in LiDAR sequences themselves for self-supervision. This advances self-supervised learning for motion prediction to predict future scene motion accurately without any human labeling effort.
