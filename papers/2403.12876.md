It covers expected formatting, style, structure, headings, figures/tables, equations etc. So keywords related to conference paper preparation and IEEE formats would be relevant. The LaTeX template and source code is also focused on, so LaTeX and document processing terms could fit as well. Let me know if any other terms come to mind!


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper template:

This paper provides a template for authors to format papers for IEEE sponsored conferences and symposia. The purpose is to standardize the formatting across papers to facilitate electronic publishing. 

The template specifies formatting details like margins, fonts, spacing, styling for headings, figures, tables, equations etc. so authors don't have to worry about these specifications and can focus on the content.

The introduction explains the rationale behind the standardized format - ease of use for authors, automatic compliance for electronic requirements, and consistent styling.

The paper then provides detailed instructions for authors on:

- Selecting the correct template based on paper size 

- Maintaining the integrity of specifications and not revising prescribed designations

- Formatting math equations, graphs, tables and other components

- Using the sample text and headings to format their own content

- Inserting figures, tables and formatting their captions

- Completing content editing before formatting

- Following style guidelines for abbreviations, units, equations etc.

- Identifying common mistakes like data/datum, affect/effect etc.

The conclusion section explains that a conclusion is optional but should not just replicate the abstract. Appendices and acknowledgments should follow the conclusion. References need accurate and complete citations following IEEE formats.

Overall, the template paper aims to guide authors thoroughly on formatting specifications so they can focus on technical content creation. Adhering to these standards will help unify style across conference proceedings and publications.
