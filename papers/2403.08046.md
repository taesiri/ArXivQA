# [Big City Bias: Evaluating the Impact of Metropolitan Size on   Computational Job Market Abilities of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08046)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and LLaMA are prone to bias from their training data. Specifically, they may exhibit "big city bias" where their performance is better for tasks associated with larger metropolitan areas that are more heavily represented in the training data.

- This could negatively impact applications like job matching systems that rely on LLMs to make predictions about salaries, employer presence, commute times, etc. If the LLM performance varies substantially by city size, it could recommend jobs that are a poor match.

Methodology:
- The authors evaluate 5 LLMs on making predictions for 384 metropolitan statistical areas in the USA related to:
  - Average salaries for certain occupations
  - Employment counts for top employers
  - Average commute times between random locations

- They compare the prediction accuracy by city population size to quantify the correlation between population and performance.

Results:
- Across all tasks, the LLMs exhibit superior performance for larger metro areas, indicating they are biased towards data related to big cities. 

- The metrics (correlation, median error, R^2) show significant correlations between lower error and larger population size.

- For example, the error rates are 41-77% higher in the 10 smallest metros compared to the 10 largest metros.

Conclusions:
- LLMs clearly reflect the "big city bias" inherent in their training data. While they have limitations for tasks like job matching, practitioners should be aware of this and work to mitigate geographic biases.

- Provides strong evidence that differences in representation in training data translate to differences in real-world performance across geographic areas.

Key Contributions:
- New dataset with rich job-related attributes across statistical metropolitan areas.
- First study to demonstrate and quantify "big city bias" in modern LLMs spanning multiple model families. 
- Warning to practitioners that bias could impact application effectiveness and recommendations for improving models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the performance of large language models on predicting salaries, commute times, and employer presence across 384 metropolitan areas in the US, finding poorer performance on smaller regions indicative of a "big city bias".


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper contributes a dataset with population, employer presence, and commute duration data for 384 metropolitan areas in the USA. It also provides outputs of 5 recent language models predicting employer presence, commute duration, and salary for these areas. The key analysis shows that language models tend to have more accurate predictions for tasks associated with larger metropolitan areas, indicating a "big city bias". Specifically, the paper finds negative correlations between metropolitan area population size and error rates across prediction tasks, with the smallest 10 regions showing over 300% worse performance than the largest 10 regions on some benchmarks. Overall, the paper quantifies and analyzes the degree of geographic bias in recent language models when making job market predictions.

The paper analyzes the correlation between the population size of 384 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the United States and the prediction accuracy of several language models on salary, employer presence, and commute duration forecasts. It finds significant evidence of "big city bias", whereby the models exhibit superior performance on tasks associated with larger cities, indicating the underrepresentation of smaller regions in their training data. Key metrics include prediction error percentages, median errors, Pearson correlation coefficients, and model size. Overall, the central theme is evaluating and quantifying the geographic bias of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using data from reputable sources for each prediction task. What sources specifically were used and why were they selected as reputable sources? How does the choice of data source impact the quality and reliability of the analysis?

2. The prompts designed for the language models contain specific instructions on how to structure the answer. What considerations went into designing effective prompts to allow for automated extraction of numerical responses? How might variations in prompt design influence model performance?

3. Pearson correlation is used as one of the evaluation metrics. What are the assumptions that underlie the use of Pearson correlation? Do you think those assumptions hold in the context of this analysis? How might violations impact the validity of the correlations reported?

4. The paper reports median percentage error across models and tasks. What does this metric actually capture about model performance on the tasks? What are other evaluation metrics that could provide additional insights into geographic biases?

5. The analysis focuses exclusively on metropolitan statistical areas in the United States. What considerations would be necessary to extend the analysis to other countries or geographic granularities? Would you expect similar trends?

6. What hypotheses do the authors have regarding the specific mechanisms leading large language models to perform better on large city-associated tasks? How might the training data or architectures contribute to this bias?

7. The results show higher correlations for some tasks than others. What explanations do the authors propose for why certain tasks exhibit stronger correlations with city size? Are there any alternative explanations that should be considered?

8. How sensitive are the results to the particular selection of language models analyzed? Could the inclusion of other models potentially change the conclusions? What cautions should be exercised in generalizing the findings?

9. The paper acknowledges several limitations to the analysis, including inconsistent language model outputs. What steps could be taken to improve consistency and reliability when eliciting responses from these probabilistic models?

10. What are the broader policy or ethical implications of these findings regarding geographic biases in language models? How should developers and practitioners account for and mitigate such biases when deploying these models?
