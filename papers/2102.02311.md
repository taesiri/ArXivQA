# [Causal Sufficiency and Actual Causation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02311)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Judea Pearl's seminal work on defining actual causation using causal models inspired dozens of proposed definitions, but they focus too much on getting intuitive answers on examples rather than formalizing Pearl's intuition to define causation as a Necessary Element of a Sufficient Set (NESS). 

- The two main strategies Pearl used were: (1) formally capture the NESS intuition, (2) test definitions on examples. But subsequent work like the Halpern & Pearl (HP) definitions only focus on the second strategy.

Proposed Solution:
- Formalize 6 notions of causal sufficiency: direct, weak, strong sufficiency and their "actual" counterparts. Combine with two types of necessity (contrastive and minimal) to get 12 definitions of causation.

- Show one of these 12 matches the latest HP definition, proving it formalizes NESS, unlike earlier HP definitions. Compare all definitions on HP's own examples.

Main Contributions:
- First to show an HP definition formalizes Pearl's NESS intuition, explains issues with earlier HP definitions

- Develops 12 new definitions using causal sufficiency and necessity, relates them to each other and HP definitions

- Compares all definitions systematically on HP's examples, finds one definition (Def 2) most intuitive and consistent 

- Suggests Def 2, using strong sufficiency and contrastive necessity, as new superior definition of actual causation
