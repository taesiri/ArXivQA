# [Towards Effective and General Graph Unlearning via Mutual Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11760)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance for graph-based AI applications. However, real-world deployment of GNNs often requires modifying trained models to meet practical demands like deleting graph elements for data privacy or removing noisy elements to improve model robustness. 
- Performing these deletion operations requires machine unlearning (MU) methods specialized for graphs to remove the influence of deleted elements (unlearning entities) while maintaining performance on non-deleted elements. However, existing graph unlearning (GU) methods have limitations in performance, efficiency, flexibility and generalization.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new GU framework called Mutual Evolution Graph Unlearning (MEGU) based on simultaneous evolution of two key capabilities:
    1) Predictive module: Adjusts original trained GNN model to eliminate influence of unlearning entities while maintaining reasoning capacity for non-unlearning entities.
    2) Unlearning module: Generates predictions for non-unlearning entities to assess forgetting capability.
- These two modules are trained jointly with losses that encourage complementary optimization and mutual benefits. This topology-guided mutual evolution ensures MEGU balances unlearning and prediction performance.   
- Two key technologies in MEGU: 
    1) Adaptive selection of high-influence neighborhoods for tailored loss functions.
    2) Topology-aware unlearning propagation leveraging graph structure.

Main Contributions:
- Provides new perspective on constraints of current GU methods and clear design targets.
- Proposes novel GU framework MEGU based on mutual evolution of predictive and unlearning modules for superior and efficient unlearning.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 benchmark datasets for feature, node and edge-level unlearning tasks. Outperforms top method GNNDelete by 2.8-6.4% accuracy.
- Reduces time and space overhead substantially compared to retraining by 159.8x and 9.6x respectively.
- Demonstrates generalizability across multiple well-known GNN models as backbone networks.

The summary covers the key aspects of the paper - the problem being addressed, the proposed mutual evolution based solution MEGU, and the main contributions in terms of performance, efficiency and flexibility. The takeaway is that MEGU advances the state-of-the-art in graph unlearning through its novel perspective and mutual evolution design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a mutual evolution graph unlearning (MEGU) framework with a predictive module to maintain performance on non-unlearning entities and an unlearning module to eliminate the influence of unlearning entities, achieving superior unlearning performance through their topology-guided mutual optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It provides a new perspective on existing graph unlearning (GU) methods by analyzing them in terms of two key modules: a predictive module and an unlearning module. It also reviews recent GU methods based on desired properties (as shown in Table 1).

2. It proposes a new GU method called Mutual Evolution Graph Unlearning (MEGU). MEGU has a predictive module based on the original trained model and a linear unlearning module. These two modules evolve mutually to optimize predictive performance on non-unlearning entities and forgetting capability on unlearning entities.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets that demonstrate MEGU's state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it outperforms prior methods by average margins of 2.7%, 2.5%, and 3.2% on feature, node, and edge level unlearning tasks respectively. MEGU also shows better training efficiency, reducing time and space overhead substantially compared to retraining the model.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the mutual evolution paradigm for graph unlearning, which achieves better performance through the interaction of the predictive and unlearning modules. The new perspective on analyzing GU methods and the extensive experimental validation also represent important contributions.
