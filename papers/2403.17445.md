# [Incorporating Exponential Smoothing into MLP: A Simple but Effective   Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17445)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data is challenging for transformer models due to the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This limits their application for very long sequences.
- Recent state space models (SSMs) like S4 show promise for long sequence modeling but have complex parameterizations and require specialized initialization schemes.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a simplified SSM variant based on exponential smoothing (ETS) that requires fewer parameters and mathematical operations. 
- Enhance simple ETS with additional learnable damped factors alpha and beta to reduce inductive bias. Make parameters complex to increase capacity.
- Exponentially parameterize lambda for stable optimization. Add constraints and shortcut connections.
- Integrate the ETS module into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture with negligible parameter increase.

Contributions:
- Introduce Exponential Smoothing MLP (ETSMLP) which incorporates an enhanced ETS module into an MLP. Converts a channel-only MLP into an effective sequence model.
- Evaluate on Long Range Arena benchmarks and NLU datasets. Achieves comparable performance to S4 despite simplicity.
- Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of proposed enhancements to ETS.
- Analysis shows ETSMLP is more parameter and memory efficient than transformer encoders, especially for long sequences.

In summary, the paper proposes a simple but surprisingly effective integration of ETS into MLPs for sequential modeling. The results highlight the potential of SSMs from a unique perspective compared to more complex variants.
