# [Dexterous Functional Grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02975)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper tackles the challenge of enabling robots to functionally grasp real-world objects like tools using dexterous hands. The key insight is to combine semantic understanding from internet data with robust control policies learned in simulation. Specifically, they use a one-shot affordance model to predict grasp points on novel objects by matching visual features across objects of the same category. This allows generalizing affordances to new instances. However, learning the intricate grasping control poses challenges for simulation training like unrealistic motions. To address this, they propose using human demo data to extract a compressed "eigengrasp" action space that encapsulates realistic hand poses. Reinforcement learning inside this space yields policies that transfer better to the real world. Their method is able to pick up and functionally grasp various tools like hammers, drills, staplers etc. in different poses. It matches or even exceeds a trained human teleoperator, demonstrating the promise of combining semantics and simulation for dexterous functional grasping.
