# [A Unified Generative Retriever for Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks   via Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14856)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question addressed is:How can we develop a single information retrieval model that can effectively perform different retrieval tasks at different levels of granularity (e.g. document retrieval, passage retrieval, sentence retrieval, entity retrieval) to support knowledge-intensive language tasks?The key points are:- Knowledge-intensive language tasks like fact checking, question answering, etc require retrieving relevant contexts from large corpora at different levels of granularity. - Existing methods either use a single coarse retriever or build specialized retrievers for each task, both having limitations.- The paper proposes a unified generative retriever (UGR) that combines the benefits of both approaches - sharing knowledge across tasks while handling task specifications. - The core contributions are:1) An n-gram based identifier to represent relevant contexts at different granularities in a unified way.2) A prompt learning strategy to inject task-specific information into the model while training it on a mixture of retrieval tasks.So in summary, the central research question is how to develop a single retriever model that can robustly perform different retrieval tasks for knowledge-intensive language applications. The UGR model with n-gram identifiers and prompt learning is proposed as a solution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a unified generative retriever (UGR) that can perform robustly across a variety of retrieval tasks for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT). The key ideas are:1. To unify different retrieval tasks into a single generative form, the paper introduces an n-gram-based identifier to represent relevant contexts at different levels of granularity. 2. To learn different retrieval tasks with a single model, the paper employs a prompt learning strategy and investigates three methods (discrete, continuous, hybrid) to design prompt tokens that capture task specifications.3. The proposed UGR model is trained on a heterogeneous set of retrieval tasks specified in prompts in a supervised, multi-task fashion. Experiments on the KILT benchmark show UGR achieves strong performance on in-domain datasets, out-of-domain datasets, and unseen tasks compared to prevailing baselines. The retrieved contexts by UGR also contribute to new state-of-the-art results on multiple KILT datasets.In summary, the main contribution is proposing a unified generative retriever via n-gram-based identifiers and prompt learning that can effectively perform a variety of retrieval tasks for knowledge-intensive language tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a unified generative retriever model that can perform a variety of retrieval tasks for knowledge-intensive language tasks by generating n-gram-based identifiers for relevant contexts and using prompt learning to capture task specifications.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in information retrieval for knowledge-intensive language tasks:- The paper proposes a unified retriever model that can perform different retrieval tasks like document retrieval, passage retrieval, etc. in a single framework. Most prior work has focused on developing specialized retrieval models for each task. A unified retriever is more practical and allows knowledge sharing across tasks.- The use of n-gram identifiers to represent different contexts like documents, passages, etc. in a common way is novel. Prior generative retrieval models used other identifiers like titles or spans. N-gram identifiers seem to work well without needing additional metadata.- The multi-task training strategy with prompt engineering allows specialization for each task while sharing knowledge. This helps improve generalization as shown by the results on out-of-domain datasets. Prompt learning is a relatively new technique being explored for NLP.- The proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results on several KILT datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the unified retriever approach. The improvement is especially significant on out-of-domain generalization.- Compared to traditional pipeline retrievers, the unified generative retriever is more parameter efficient and faster for inference. This makes deployment more practical.Overall, the unified retriever idea is innovative and promising for information retrieval in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The techniques used like n-gram identifiers and prompt learning are interesting additions over prior generative retrieval methods. The results validate the effectiveness of the approach, especially for generalization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:1. Improving the efficiency of the unified generative retriever (UGR) model: The authors note that UGR needs a complex scoring function to solve the identifier repetition problem. They encourage exploring other effective and efficient semantic identifiers for generative retrieval that avoid this issue.2. Training a more general unified generative retrieval model: The authors suggest training a model that can serve different retrieval applications across multiple corpora and modalities, not just the KILT benchmark datasets based on Wikipedia. This involves generalizing UGR to new tasks, domains, and knowledge sources.3. Integrating knowledge more efficiently: The authors note the potential for generative retrieval models like UGR to save significant time and computational resources by efficiently integrating knowledge from different retrieval tasks into one model. But further improvements in knowledge integration and sharing could be made.4. Exploring new model architectures: While UGR uses a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model, the authors suggest exploring other model architectures that may be better suited for unified generative retrieval across diverse tasks.In summary, the main future directions are improving efficiency, generalizability, knowledge integration, and exploring new model architectures for unified generative retrieval that can robustly serve diverse tasks over varied corpora and modalities. The key is developing retrievers that are both effective and practical in real-world applications.
