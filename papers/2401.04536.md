# [Evaluating Language Model Agency through Negotiations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current language model (LM) benchmarks are predominantly static and ill-suited for evaluating agent-like behavior. They poorly capture LM agency, economic constraints, have data leakage risks, and become obsolete as models progress. 
- There is a need for reliable and scalable benchmarks to evaluate LMs being used as AI agents with increasing autonomy. These require dynamic evaluations with multi-turn, cross-model interaction.

Proposed Solution:
- Use negotiation games as benchmarks to evaluate LM agency. Negotiation is dynamic, allows for cooperative/competitive analysis, modulating complexity, and mitigates leakage.
- The framework defines negotiations between two LMs with issues, preferences, and rules. It conducts self-play and cross-play, measures performance (e.g. utility) and alignment metrics (e.g. faithfulness).

Experiments and Key Results:  
- Tested major public LMs like Anthropic's Claude, Google's Bard, OpenAI's GPT-3 in extensive self-play and cross-play negotiations.
- Most models performed decently in simple, single issue scenarios but struggled with multiple issues and finding cooperative opportunities.
- GPT-3.5 had superior faithfulness but lagged in completion rate and utility outcomes. 
- Open-source LLMs were unable to complete any games, highlighting big gaps.

Main Contributions:
- Framework for reliable, scaled evaluation of agent abilities via dynamic negotiation games. 
- Empirical performance analysis of major language models.
- Identified key deficiencies like finding cooperative strategies and handling complex games.
- Public release of negotiation data and open-source code for replication.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using structured negotiations as a dynamic benchmark to evaluate language model agency, allowing for multi-turn cross-model interactions while modulating task complexity and avoiding data leakage issues of static benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework to evaluate language model agency through structured negotiations. Specifically:

1) They propose using negotiation games as a dynamic, co-evolving benchmark to jointly evaluate language model alignment and performance over multiple turns and enable cross-model interaction. This addresses limitations of current predominantly static evaluation methods.

2) They present extensive empirical results evaluating several major publicly accessible language models on a variety of self-play and cross-play negotiation games. Key findings are that open-source models currently struggle on these tasks, cooperative bargaining proves challenging, and the most powerful models do not always "win". 

3) They release an open-source library and all generated negotiation data to allow other researchers to replicate and extend their findings.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Language models (LMs)
- LM agency 
- Dynamic benchmarks
- Structured negotiations
- Self-play
- Cross-play 
- Performance metrics
- Alignment metrics
- Completion rates
- Cooperative bargaining
- Theory of mind (ToM)
- Action-faithfulness

The paper proposes using structured negotiations as dynamic benchmarks to evaluate language model agency, the ability of LMs to display agent-like behavior. It conducts experiments using self-play (where a model plays against itself) and cross-play (where different models play against each other) on negotiation games of varying complexity. The paper analyzes both performance metrics like completion rates as well as alignment metrics like faithfulness. Key findings include that current LMs struggle with cooperative bargaining games and that the most powerful model does not always "win" negotiations.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using negotiation games as a framework to evaluate language model agency. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to existing static evaluation benchmarks?

2. The paper distinguishes between distributive, compatible, integrative, and non-integrative negotiation games. What is the significance of these distinctions and how do they allow modulating the complexity of negotiations?

3. The concept of "state-of-mind consistency" is introduced to measure the faithfulness of language models during negotiations. What exactly does this entail and why is it an important metric to consider? 

4. Various factors like computational capacity, memory, visibility, stability, etc. are explored in the paper through ablations. Which of these factors seem to have the biggest impact on negotiation performance and why?

5. The paper argues that the prompt engineering process could lead to biased negotiation outcomes. What types of biases are discussed and how does the framework attempt to control for them?

6. What are some key differences observed between self-play and cross-play experiments in the paper? What might explain some of these differences in performance across models?  

7. The most powerful model, Four, is found to underperform on actual negotiation outcomes despite strong performance on faithfulness and following instructions. What might explain this discrepancy?

8. What future extensions or modifications of the framework are suggested in the paper? Which of these seem most promising or impactful to explore?

9. The paper finds current LM agents struggle with multi-issue and cooperative bargaining games. What might need to improve for LMs to successfully complete more complex negotiation tasks?  

10. If you were to implement or extend this work, what are some key limitations or ethical considerations you would need to take into account based on the discussion in the paper?
