# [Self supervised convolutional kernel based handcrafted feature   harmonization: Enhanced left ventricle hypertension disease phenotyping on   echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08897)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can self-supervised learning and convolutional kernels be utilized to develop a harmonization filter that can generate consistent and robust handcrafted radiomic features from echocardiography images acquired across different devices and protocols?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

A harmonization filter crafted from the convolutional kernels of a self-supervised model trained on echocardiography data can effectively transform echocardiography images into feature maps enriched with robust representative information. This will enable consistent extraction of handcrafted radiomic features that can improve classification performance for myocardial diseases like left ventricular hypertrophy.

In essence, the paper investigates using self-supervised learning to develop a specialized convolutional filter that can harmonize echocardiography images and make handcrafted feature extraction more robust. The effectiveness of this approach for improving myocardial disease classification is then evaluated.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a self-supervised convolutional kernel-based harmonization filter to improve the consistency and reproducibility of handcrafted radiomic feature extraction from echocardiography images acquired across different devices and settings. 

Specifically, the authors:

- Trained a ConvNeXt-V2 model in a self-supervised manner on an echocardiography dataset to learn robust feature representations (ConvNeXtV2-Echo). 

- Used the first convolutional layer of ConvNeXtV2-Echo as a harmonization filter to convert echocardiography images into enhanced feature maps.

- Evaluated the filter through Jensen-Shannon divergence metric and showed it improves feature distribution similarity across devices compared to original data and other harmonization techniques.

- Demonstrated the filter improves performance in a downstream classification task of distinguishing hypertensive heart disease from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, outperforming original data and other harmonization methods.

So in summary, the main contribution is developing and demonstrating a self-supervised learning based convolutional filter for harmonizing handcrafted radiomic features from echocardiography images, enhancing their consistency across different devices and improving performance in a downstream classification task. The self-supervised learning aspect and application to echocardiography radiomic feature harmonization are novel.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using a self-supervised learning technique to create a convolutional filter that can harmonize handcrafted radiomic features extracted from echocardiography images acquired across different devices and settings, and shows this harmonization improves classification performance for left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosis.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of medical image harmonization:

- Using self-supervised learning for image harmonization is a novel approach. Most prior work has focused on statistical harmonization methods like ComBat or image translation methods like CycleGAN. Using the convolutional filters from a self-supervised model like ConvNeXt is an interesting new technique.

- Evaluating harmonization performance with Jensen-Shannon divergence on feature distributions provides a quantitative metric, which is not always done in this field. Many papers just provide visual results. The JSD analysis here objectively demonstrates the improvement from the proposed method.

- Application to echocardiography data is relevant, as variability in ultrasound imaging settings poses challenges for applying radiomics/handcrafted features. Showing improved LVH classification with harmonized features demonstrates potential clinical utility. 

- The sample size used for LVH classification is reasonably sized but still quite small (just over 100 cases) compared to some radiomics studies with hundreds or thousands of patients. External validation on additional datasets would strengthen the evidence.

- Comparing against standard harmonization methods like ComBat and state-of-the-art self-supervised models like ConvNeXt is useful benchmarking. Including CycleGAN or other image translation techniques could provide another interesting comparison point.

Overall, this paper presents a novel harmonization approach and provides initial evidence for its utility in analysing echocardiography images. The quantitative evaluation and clinical application are strengths. As with any early stage research, further validation on larger datasets would be beneficial to firmly establish efficacy and generalizability. But this appears to be promising preliminary work advancing the state of the art in this application area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Acquiring a larger and more balanced dataset for the downstream LVH classification task. The authors note the sample size and imbalance between manufacturers in the current dataset as limitations. Expanding the dataset could allow for more robust evaluation of the harmonization techniques.

- Additional external validation on different datasets. The authors mention the need to validate the generalizability of their harmonization approach through testing on additional diverse datasets from different sources. 

- Exploring the potential of increasing the performance of ConvNeXtV2-Echo with more training data. The authors suggest that with a larger clinical training dataset, the performance of ConvNeXtV2-Echo could improve further and potentially match ConvNeXtV2-Color.

- Testing the applicability of the harmonization techniques to other ultrasound imaging modalities beyond echocardiography. The authors developed their method for echocardiography data, but suggest assessing if it could generalize to other ultrasound modalities.

- Evaluating the impact of the harmonization techniques on other downstream tasks beyond LVH classification. The current study focused on LVH classification, but the harmonization approach could be validated on other tasks.

- Investigating other self-supervised learning methods and architectures beyond ConvNeXtV2. The authors adopted ConvNeXtV2 in this study, but other SSL techniques could also be explored as the basis for harmonization.

In summary, the key future directions emphasized by the authors include expanding the datasets, additional validation on diverse data, evaluating other ultrasound modalities and downstream tasks, and exploring other SSL methods. This suggests avenues to further establish the usefulness of their proposed harmonization technique.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a self-supervised learning approach using convolutional kernels for harmonizing handcrafted features extracted from echocardiography images. The approach trains a ConvNeXt-V2 model in a self-supervised manner on echocardiography data to learn robust feature representations. The first convolutional layer of the trained model is then used as a 2D convolutional filter to generate filtered echocardiography images enriched with representative features. Handcrafted radiomic features extracted from the filtered images are more harmonized across different imaging devices and protocols compared to the original images. The approach is evaluated by analyzing feature distribution similarity across devices using Jensen-Shannon divergence and by performing a classification task for left ventricular hypertrophy diseases. The harmonized features from the proposed approach lead to improved classification performance compared to original and Combat harmonized features, demonstrating its effectiveness for echocardiography image analysis.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for harmonizing handcrafted features extracted from echocardiography images using self-supervised learning and convolutional kernels. The key idea is to use a pretrained ConvNeXt model to create a "harmonization filter" that can convert echocardiography images into more uniform feature maps. These filtered images can then be used to extract handcrafted radiomic features in a more consistent way, even when the original images come from different devices or protocols. 

The authors train a ConvNeXt model in a self-supervised manner on a large dataset of echocardiograms. The first convolutional layer of this model is then used as the harmonization filter. In experiments, the proposed method shows improved consistency of radiomic feature values across different image sources compared to standard harmonization techniques like ComBat. Additionally, features extracted after harmonization lead to better classification performance in a downstream task of distinguishing hypertensive heart disease from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Overall, this work demonstrates a novel way to leverage self-supervised learning for harmonizing handcrafted features from medical images. The results suggest this is a promising approach for making radiomics analyses more robust across heterogeneous image data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is applying a self-supervised learning (SSL) trained convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt-V2) as a harmonization filter to preprocess echocardiography images before extracting handcrafted radiomic features. Specifically, the authors fine-tuned ConvNeXt-V2 on an echocardiography dataset in a self-supervised manner to learn robust features. They then utilized the first convolutional layer of this tuned ConvNeXtV2-Echo model as a 2D convolutional filter to generate filtered versions of new echocardiography images. By passing an image through this filter before extracting features, the aim is to harmonize the features and make them more consistent across different devices and protocols. To evaluate this, they extract radiomic features from the original and filtered images, compute feature similarity using Jensen-Shannon divergence, and test on a left ventricular hypertrophy classification task. The results demonstrate improved feature harmonization and classification performance using the ConvNeXtV2-Echo filter compared to other methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem being addressed is the lack of consistency and reproducibility in extracting quantitative imaging features (radiomics) from echocardiography images due to variable imaging settings across devices, protocols, and software. This variability poses challenges in applying radiomics for disease diagnosis. 

Specifically, the paper focuses on addressing this problem in the context of diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) diseases like hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) using echocardiography images. LVH diagnosis with radiomics faces difficulties due to differences in echocardiography image characteristics stemming from diverse devices and protocols.

To tackle this problem, the paper proposes a self-supervised learning based convolutional filter as a harmonization technique to enable consistent and robust extraction of radiomics features from echocardiography images across various settings. The key question is whether this proposed harmonization filter can improve reproducibility of radiomics feature extraction and in turn improve classification performance for LVH diseases.

In summary, the paper aims to address the lack of consistency in radiomics feature extraction from echocardiography images by developing and evaluating a self-supervised learning based harmonization filter, with a focus on improving LVH disease diagnosis as an application.
