# [Scaling Face Interaction Graph Networks to Real World Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11985)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Learned physics simulators based on graph networks can accurately model complex real-world dynamics like friction and contact, but don't scale well to scenes with many intricate objects or to real-world settings where only visual input is available. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce FIGNet*, a modified version of the FIGNet learned rigid-body dynamics simulator that removes mesh surface edges to greatly reduce memory usage and allow scaling to more objects.
- Connect FIGNet* to real-world scenes by using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to convert images to meshes that can be simulated by FIGNet*, and then convert the simulated meshes back to images via NeRF scene editing.

Methods:
- FIGNet* removes the surface mesh edges from FIGNet while retaining the collision detection edges. This reduces memory usage by >50% with little loss in accuracy.
- Real-world scenes are captured with 360 degree images and encoded into a NeRF. The NeRF scene is edited to create object segmentations which are converted into meshes. 
- These meshes are passed to the FIGNet* simulator to generate a predicted rigid-body transform sequence. 
- The NeRF is edited using these transforms to rerender the scene with the updated object positions, creating a predicted rollout video.

Results:
- FIGNet* matches FIGNet's accuracy on rigid-body benchmarks while using less memory, enabling training on more complex synthetic scenes.
- Qualitative rollouts on real still-life scenes with fruits, baskets, etc. suggest the method can generalize despite only seeing synthetic training data.

Contributions:
- Memory-efficient modification to state-of-the-art learned rigid body simulator FIGNet.
- Demonstration of using neural scene representations to apply pre-trained simulators to real visual observations.
- Qualitative rigid body prediction results on real still-life scenes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a more memory-efficient variant of the FIGNet learned physics simulator that can be applied to real-world scenes by using Neural Radiance Fields to extract object meshes and render predicted dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A memory-efficient modification to the Face Interaction Graph Networks (FIGNet) simulator called FIGNet* that removes the surface mesh edges while retaining accuracy. This allows training on more complex scenes than the original FIGNet could handle.

2) Connecting FIGNet* to real-world scenes using a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a perceptual front-end. This converts real images to meshes that FIGNet* can simulate, allowing plausible rigid body simulation rollouts on real scenes.

3) Showing that despite only training on synthetic data, FIGNet* generalizes successfully to real-world scenes, even with imperfect mesh estimates from NeRF. The method is robust to real-world perception noise.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a way to scale graph network simulators like FIGNet to complex real-world scenes by improving memory efficiency and connecting the simulator to a perceptual front-end. This enables plausible physical interaction simulation on real visual data.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Face Interaction Graph Networks (FIGNet) - A graph neural network model for learning rigid body dynamics by representing objects as meshes and using different types of graph edges (node-node, object-node, face-face) to model interactions.

- FIGNet* - A memory efficient variant of FIGNet that removes the node-node edges while maintaining accuracy. Allows scaling to more complex scenes.

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) - An implicit neural scene representation that is used as a perceptual front-end to extract meshes from real world scenes and re-render predicted dynamics. 

- Perception pipeline - The method connecting FIGNet* to real world scenes via NeRF, involving steps like mesh extraction, building interaction graphs, simulating rollouts, and re-rendering rollouts by editing the NeRF scene.

- Memory efficiency - A key contribution is developing a dynamics model (FIGNet*) that uses less GPU memory than prior state-of-the-art (FIGNet), enabling scaling to more complex scenes.

- Real world generalization - Showing that a dynamics model trained purely in simulation can generalize to real world scenes by using a learned perceptual front-end like NeRF.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions that FIGNet* works surprisingly well despite the removal of surface mesh node-node edges. Can you explain in more detail why this simple change works so effectively for rigid body dynamics? Does it have to do with the types of constraints in rigid body collisions that allow the information to propagate through the object-node edges?

2. How robust is FIGNet* to different choices of physical parameters like mass, friction, restitution etc. for the extracted meshes? You use default values in this paper - but how sensitive is performance to changes in these parameters? 

3. You extract the bounding volume for objects using 2D segmentation masks from different views. How does performance change with more views? At what point do you start to see diminishing returns, and is there a principled way to determine the optimal number of views?

4. The decimation process seems important for controlling GPU memory usage. You show qualitative results - but it would be interesting to see a more detailed ablation on how different levels of decimation affect prediction accuracy in both simulation and real scenes. 

5. You render predicted rollouts using volumetric NeRF editing. How do the results compare if you instead feed the predicted meshes directly into a different renderer? This could reveal whether artifacts are due to FIGNet* dynamics predictions or the NeRF editing process.

6. For real world experiments, default physical parameters are used rather than trying to estimate them per object. What approaches could be used to infer these parameters automatically from real world video? How much would estimating physical parameters per object improve performance?

7. The method relies on access to camera intrinsics and extrinsics for multi-view observations of scenes. How does performance degrade with increasing noise in the camera parameters?

8. Could this method work for non rigid objects? What changes would need to be made to FIGNet* and the processing pipeline?

9. You train dynamics models on synthetic data and apply them to real data without any fine-tuning. What benefits could you get from fine-tuning on real trajectories, and how would you handle challenges like perceptual noise? 

10. The method currently focuses on small tabletop scenes with 5-10 objects. What advances would be needed in terms of network architecture, training procedures etc. to model much larger real world scenes with 50+ objects?
