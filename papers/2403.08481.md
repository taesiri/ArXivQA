# [SoK: Reducing the Vulnerability of Fine-tuned Language Models to   Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Large language models (LLMs) are being widely used in various applications, but they raise privacy concerns as they may memorize sensitive information from their training data. This makes them vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIA) which try to determine if a specific data sample was used to train the model. 

- Prior work studying defenses against MIA has focused on computer vision and classic ML models. There is limited research on what factors affect the vulnerability of LLMs to MIA and the effectiveness of different defense strategies tailored to LLMs.

Approach & Contributions
- This paper provides the first systematic review focused on the vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks. 

- It thoroughly analyzes factors that influence susceptibility to MIA such as number of training iterations, model size, model exposure to training samples.

- It explores mitigation techniques like differential privacy (DP), low rank adaptation (LoRA), and empirically analyzes their effectiveness at preventing MIA for LLMs.

Key Findings
- Factors like large batch size and fewer training epochs reduce vulnerability to MIA.  

- Fine-tuning with fewer parameters using LoRA provides strong defense against MIA while minimally impacting accuracy.

- Combining LoRA with DP provides similar protection as full fine-tuning with DP, but with less degradation in accuracy.

- DP-based methods offer the best privacy/accuracy tradeoff. When not feasible, LoRA alone also provides reasonable defense against MIA.

In summary, this is the first comprehensive analysis focused specifically on membership inference attacks against fine-tuned LLMs. It studies various factors affecting vulnerability, and provides useful guidelines and defense strategies to develop privacy-preserving LLMs.
