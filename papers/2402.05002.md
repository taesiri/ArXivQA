# [Randomized Confidence Bounds for Stochastic Partial Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The partial monitoring (PM) framework models sequential decision making problems where the learning agent receives partial feedback that does not fully reveal the losses incurred or outcomes obtained on each round.
- Existing PM strategies have limitations. Deterministic strategies like CBP have strong theoretical guarantees but are outperformed empirically by stochastic strategies. However, stochastic strategies have limited or no theoretical guarantees. 
- In the contextual PM setting, existing strategies are also limited. CBPside only applies to easy contextual games. IDS-FW has restrictions on requiring a finite known context set.

Proposed Solutions:

1. Randomized Confidence Bounds for PM (RandCBP)
- Randomize the confidence bounds used in the deterministic CBP strategy. This maintains CBP's theoretical guarantees while significantly improving empirical performance.

2. Extend CBP to Hard Contextual Games (CBPside*)  
- Propose corrected confidence bounds and new definition of underplayed actions based on pseudo-counts, making CBPside applicable to both easy and hard contextual games.

3. Randomized Confidence Bounds for Contextual PM (RandCBPside*)
- Further randomize the confidence bounds of CBPside* to get a strategy that outperforms CBPside* empirically while still having theoretical guarantees on both easy and hard contextual games.

Main Contributions:

- Show that randomizing confidence bounds benefits not just OFU strategies but more broadly successive elimination strategies like CBP. 

- RandCBP matches CBP's regret guarantees while significantly outperforming it and other baselines empirically.

- CBPside* is the first strategy with regret guarantees on both easy and hard contextual games. 

- RandCBPside* further improves performance while maintaining these guarantees.

- Provide a real-world use case of PM for monitoring classification system error rates, to demonstrate applicability and encourage adoption.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces randomized confidence bound strategies for stochastic partial monitoring that improve empirical performance over deterministic counterparts while preserving theoretical guarantees.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It introduces randomized variants of CBP-based strategies (RandCBP and RandCBPside*) for partial monitoring problems. These strategies randomize the confidence bounds used in CBP strategies, and are shown to maintain similar regret guarantees while improving empirical performance over deterministic CBP strategies. 

2) It proposes a corrected version of the CBPside strategy called CBPside*, which extends CBP-based strategies to contextual partial monitoring settings with regret guarantees on both easy and hard games. This also allows the randomized version RandCBPside* to get regret guarantees on both easy and hard contextual games.

3) The experiments show that the proposed randomized strategies RandCBP and RandCBPside* significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on several partial monitoring games.

4) The paper designs a new real-world use case of monitoring the error rate of black-box classifiers using the partial monitoring framework. This illustrates how partial monitoring can be applied to real-world problems.

In summary, the main contributions are introducing randomized variants of CBP strategies with improved empirical performance, extending CBPside to get guarantees on hard contextual games, and showing strong experimental results and a real-world use case to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach.

The paper introduces randomized confidence bounds to improve the empirical performance of partial monitoring strategies based on the Confidence Bound Policy (CBP). It studies both the non-contextual and contextual partial monitoring settings with stochastic outcomes. Key contributions include proposed strategies called RandCBP and RandCBPsidestar along with their regret analysis, comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines, and a real-world use case for monitoring the error rate of black-box classifiers. The key terms reflect this focus on randomized confidence bounds, contextual bandits, regret bounds, and connections to real-world applications in the partial monitoring framework.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the randomized confidence bounds method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces randomized confidence bounds to improve the empirical performance of CBP-based strategies while maintaining their regret guarantees. However, what is the theoretical justification for why randomizing confidence bounds improves performance? Is there an information-theoretic argument?

2. How sensitive is the performance of RandCBP and RandCBPside* to the choice of randomization parameters like the number of bins K, the tail probability ε, and the standard deviation σ of the discretized Gaussian distribution used? Is there guidance on choosing these optimally? 

3. The regret bounds for RandCBP match those of the deterministic CBP. But is it possible to get tighter regret bounds by using properties of the randomized confidence bounds?

4. For the contextual setting, how does the choice of ridge regularization parameter λ affect the regret guarantees and empirical performance of RandCBPside*? 

5. The paper focuses on linear contextual bandits. How can these randomized confidence bound ideas be extended to generalized linear contextual bandits like logistic regression or Poisson regression?

6. The exploration strategy in CBPside* using pseudo-counts is key to obtaining regret bounds for hard contextual games. But how tight are these bounds compared to other state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms?

7. In the experiment on monitoring classifier error rates, what is the sample complexity comparison between the contextual bandit algorithms and simply using fixed sample size estimates based on concentration inequalities?

8. Is it possible to obtain problem-dependent regret bounds for RandCBP on hard partial monitoring games similar to the bounds for easy games?

9. How do uncoupled randomized confidence bounds compare empirically to coupled randomized confidence bounds where a single random variable parameterizes all bounds?

10. The paper focuses on stochastic partial monitoring settings. How can these randomized confidence bound ideas apply to non-stochastic or adversarial partial monitoring games?
