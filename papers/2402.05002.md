# [Randomized Confidence Bounds for Stochastic Partial Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05002)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The partial monitoring (PM) framework models sequential decision making problems where the learning agent receives partial feedback that does not fully reveal the losses incurred or outcomes obtained on each round.
- Existing PM strategies have limitations. Deterministic strategies like CBP have strong theoretical guarantees but are outperformed empirically by stochastic strategies. However, stochastic strategies have limited or no theoretical guarantees. 
- In the contextual PM setting, existing strategies are also limited. CBPside only applies to easy contextual games. IDS-FW has restrictions on requiring a finite known context set.

Proposed Solutions:

1. Randomized Confidence Bounds for PM (RandCBP)
- Randomize the confidence bounds used in the deterministic CBP strategy. This maintains CBP's theoretical guarantees while significantly improving empirical performance.

2. Extend CBP to Hard Contextual Games (CBPside*)  
- Propose corrected confidence bounds and new definition of underplayed actions based on pseudo-counts, making CBPside applicable to both easy and hard contextual games.

3. Randomized Confidence Bounds for Contextual PM (RandCBPside*)
- Further randomize the confidence bounds of CBPside* to get a strategy that outperforms CBPside* empirically while still having theoretical guarantees on both easy and hard contextual games.

Main Contributions:

- Show that randomizing confidence bounds benefits not just OFU strategies but more broadly successive elimination strategies like CBP. 

- RandCBP matches CBP's regret guarantees while significantly outperforming it and other baselines empirically.

- CBPside* is the first strategy with regret guarantees on both easy and hard contextual games. 

- RandCBPside* further improves performance while maintaining these guarantees.

- Provide a real-world use case of PM for monitoring classification system error rates, to demonstrate applicability and encourage adoption.
