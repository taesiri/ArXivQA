# [Improving Sequence-to-Sequence Learning via Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06283)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central hypothesis of this paper is that using optimal transport loss as an additional training objective can improve sequence-to-sequence learning compared to standard maximum likelihood estimation. 

Specifically, the authors propose to add an optimal transport loss term to the standard MLE loss function when training seq2seq models. The optimal transport loss measures the distance between the distributions of the generated and reference sequences, encouraging semantic similarity. 

Thus, the main research questions are:

- Can adding an optimal transport loss improve seq2seq model performance compared to standard MLE training?

- Does optimal transport provide a useful sequence-level training signal that encourages global semantic consistency?

- Can optimal transport help alleviate issues with exposure bias and train-test mismatch that exist with word-level MLE training?

The authors test this hypothesis by applying their proposed optimal transport augmented training to a diverse set of seq2seq tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. The consistent improvements across tasks provide evidence that optimal transport is a useful regularizer that can enhance seq2seq learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning algorithm based on optimal transport (OT) to impose global sequence-level supervision. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Introducing an OT objective as a sequence-level loss to encourage semantic similarity between generated and reference sequences. This overcomes the limitation of standard maximum likelihood estimation which only provides word-level supervision.

- Interpreting the proposed method as approximate Wasserstein gradient flows, showing it learns to match the sequence distribution induced by the generator to the true data distribution.

- Applying the method to three NLP tasks - machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning - and demonstrating consistent improvements over strong MLE baselines.

So in summary, the core novelty is using OT to construct a sequence-level training loss that promotes semantic invariance and long-range consistency. This is shown to outperform standard MLE and sequence-adversarial methods across various text generation benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new sequence-to-sequence learning approach that uses optimal transport to impose sequence-level supervision, helping models better preserve semantic information during generation compared to maximum likelihood estimation alone.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points on how this paper compares to other research in sequence-to-sequence learning:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new training method for sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models based on optimal transport (OT). This is a novel approach compared to prior work, which has focused more on reinforcement learning (RL) or adversarial training for sequence-level training. Using OT loss for end-to-end training of Seq2Seq models has not been extensively explored before.

- Compared to RL methods, the OT loss does not require extrinsic rewards and leads to lower variance gradients. It provides a more intrinsic measure of sequence similarity. This could make training more stable. 

- Compared to adversarial methods like SeqGAN, the OT loss does not involve delicate mini-max game training. So it avoids some of the mode collapse issues that can happen with GANs. Overall, it provides a simpler and more direct training approach.

- The authors demonstrate strong empirical results across multiple tasks like machine translation, summarization, and image captioning. The consistent gains across very different tasks highlight the versatility of this approach.

- The theoretical interpretation as an approximate Wasserstein gradient flow is also novel, and provides justification for using the OT loss from an optimal transport perspective.

Overall, using OT for end-to-end Seq2Seq training seems like a promising research direction. The results here are quite competitive to more complex approaches like RL and adversarial training. The simplicity and stability of this approach could make it widely applicable. The connections drawn to optimal transport theory are also interesting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying the proposed method to more complicated Seq2Seq models and more recent datasets (beyond the ones tested in the paper). The authors suggest trying their method on more advanced models like the Transformer, as well as newer datasets like CNN/DailyMail for summarization.

- Exploring the use of their method for other sequence generation tasks such as conversational response generation. The authors propose this as an interesting area for future work.

- Investigating other cost functions beyond the cosine distance used in the paper, to better match the geometry of sequence data. The authors suggest exploring other non-Euclidean costs. 

- Improving the efficiency and scalability of the optimal transport computation to handle very large datasets. The authors note computational complexity as an open challenge.

- Extending the theoretical understanding of why the proposed method works, beyond the preliminary Wasserstein gradient flow interpretation provided. More analysis on the properties of the method could be valuable.

- Trying more sophisticated variance reduction techniques when using alternatives like Gumbel-softmax to represent model belief. The authors found plain Gumbel-softmax underperformed, suggesting variance reduction as future work.

- Applying the method to multimodal tasks like video captioning. The authors demonstrate the approach on image captioning, and suggest expanding to other multimodal domains.

In summary, the main future directions relate to 1) applying the method to new models and tasks, 2) exploring better cost functions, 3) improving computational efficiency, 4) providing more theoretical analysis, 5) reducing variance of alternatives like Gumbel-softmax, and 6) expanding to multimodal settings. The authors position their work as a general framework applicable across many Seq2Seq problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to improve sequence-to-sequence learning using optimal transport. Maxiumum likelihood estimation is commonly used to train sequence-to-sequence models, but it focuses on local syntactic patterns and may fail to capture long range semantic structure. The authors introduce an optimal transport based loss to provide sequence-level supervision and help preserve semantic features. This matches similar words and phrases between the generated and reference sequences. The method can be interpreted as approximating a Wasserstein gradient flow to match the model distribution to the true data distribution. Experiments across machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning show consistent improvements over standard maximum likelihood training. The optimal transport loss provides a general way to add sequence-level supervision and improve semantic matching in sequence-to-sequence models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to improve sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) learning using optimal transport. Seq2seq models like those used in machine translation are typically trained with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which focuses on word-level objectives. This can fail to capture long-range semantic structure. 

The paper introduces a seq2seq training approach that imposes global sequence-level guidance via optimal transport. Optimal transport provides a way to match similar words and phrases between two sequences, promoting semantic similarity. The method is applied to machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over strong MLE baselines across these tasks. The optimal transport loss allows end-to-end training and acts as an effective regularizer to MLE training. The method is shown to be more robust than alternatives like reinforcement learning and adversarial training.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning approach using optimal transport (OT) to construct a sequence-level loss function. Specifically, the authors introduce an OT distance between the generated sequence and reference sequence at the semantic level. This OT distance is computed efficiently using the Inexact Proximal point method for Optimal Transport (IPOT) algorithm. To maintain syntactic structure, this OT loss is combined with the standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) loss. The full training objective becomes the MLE loss plus OT loss as a regularization term. Compared to existing sequence-level training methods like reinforcement learning and adversarial learning, this OT-augmented approach provides improved semantic matching without requiring extra network parameters or unstable training dynamics like GANs. The overall method aims to improve Seq2Seq models by adding global sequence-level supervision via OT, while retaining the syntactic modeling capability of MLE training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem that standard maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) training of sequence-to-sequence models focuses on modeling local syntactic patterns and fails to capture long-range semantic structure. The key questions it aims to address are:

1. How can we impose global sequence-level guidance to help sequence-to-sequence models better characterize and preserve semantic features? 

2. Can we understand sequence-level training through the lens of optimal transport and Wasserstein gradient flows?

3. How can optimal transport provide a robust and effective way to train sequence-to-sequence models in an end-to-end fashion, overcoming issues with reinforcement learning and adversarial training schemes?

Specifically, the paper proposes using optimal transport distances between generated and reference sequences as a way to regularize MLE training. This provides a sequence-level loss that promotes semantic similarity between generated and reference sequences. The paper also shows the connection between their training procedure and Wasserstein gradient flows, providing justification for using the proposed optimal transport regularization. Experiments on machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning demonstrate improved performance over standard MLE training baselines.

In summary, the key focus is on improving sequence-to-sequence learning by incorporating optimal transport losses to capture semantic similarity, moving beyond word-level maximum likelihood training.
