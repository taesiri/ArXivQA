# [RL-CFR: Improving Action Abstraction for Imperfect Information   Extensive-Form Games with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games (IIEFGs) like poker have vast state and action spaces, posing computational challenges for algorithms like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR). 
- Using fixed action abstractions can lead to sub-optimal performance. Existing dynamic action abstraction methods have limited applicability and poor convergence.
- Key challenges are handling the mixed strategy nature and probability-dependent rewards in IIEFGs.

Proposed Solution:
- A novel MDP formulation tailored for IIEFGs with states as public information, actions as features denoting specific abstractions, and rewards as expected payoff differences between selected and default abstractions.
- A new RL-CFR framework integrating Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and CFR. It constructs a game tree using RL-guided action abstractions and solves strategy with CFR.
- Can be trained from scratch to find superior action abstractions without increasing CFR solving time. Addresses mixed strategy and probability-dependent reward challenges.

Key Contributions:
- Innovative MDP formulation for IIEFGs with dimension reduction, stability and dynamic adjustment of action abstractions
- Novel RL-CFR framework achieving balance between computation and optimism. Customizable tradeoff between complexity and performance.
- Evaluated on complex Heads-Up No-Limit Texas Hold'em, significantly outperforming leading baseline agents like ReBeL's replication and Slumbot.

In summary, the paper introduces a pioneering RL-CFR approach to effectively handle challenges in large IIEFGs like poker by dynamically optimizing action abstractions. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate clear performance improvements over state-of-the-art algorithms.
