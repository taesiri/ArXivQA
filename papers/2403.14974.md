# [AVT2-DWF: Improving Deepfake Detection with Audio-Visual Fusion and   Dynamic Weighting Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14974)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
With advances in AI, deepfakes can now synthesize realistic fake videos/audios by fusing information across modalities (e.g. visual, audio). This makes detecting them very challenging. Prior detection methods have focused mostly on single modalities and have poor cross-dataset generalization. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes AVT^2-DWF, an audio-visual dual transformer model grounded in dynamic weight fusion to capture both intra- and inter-modality deepfake cues. The key components are:

1) Face Transformer Encoder: Employs a novel n-frame tokenization strategy to extract comprehensive spatial-temporal facial features from videos, capturing nuances in expressions over time.  

2) Audio Transformer Encoder: Leverages self-attention to extract long-range audio dependencies and patterns.

3) Dynamic Weight Fusion (DWF) Module: Predict modality weights to integrate audio-visual features and balance fusion of inter-modality deepfake cues.

Main Contributions:

1) Novel n-frame tokenization spatial-temporal encoding of facial video dynamics 

2) Audio-visual architecture grounded in dynamic weight fusion to amplify intra- and cross-modality deepfake cues

3) State-of-the-art detection performance on DeepfakeTIMIT, FakeAVCeleb and DFDC datasets, including excellent cross-dataset generalization, demonstrating broad applicability.

In summary, the paper presents an audio-visual dual transformer deepfake detection method focused on fusing intra- and inter-modality cues via dynamic weighting. This provides state-of-the-art performance and cross-dataset robustness.
