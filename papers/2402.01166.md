# [A Comprehensive Survey on 3D Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the emerging field of artificial intelligence generated 3D content (AIGC-3D). The goal is to systematically categorize recent advances in 3D content generation methods and consolidate developments across three paradigms: 3D native generation, 2D prior-based 3D generation, and hybrid 3D generation.

The paper first introduces key 3D representations like point clouds, voxels, meshes, neural radiance fields, and 3D gaussian splatting. It also covers diffusion models that serve as powerful 2D priors. The survey then chronologically summarizes milestone techniques across the three categories. 

For 3D native methods, the focus is generating shapes, scenes or humans using models trained directly on 3D supervision. However, these approaches are limited by scarce 3D training data. 2D prior-based techniques instead optimize 3D outputs to match views rendered from powerful 2D diffusion models like Stable Diffusion. But consistency across views remains challenging. Recently, hybrid methods aim to combine the strengths - leveraging abundant 2D data alongside targeted 3D supervision. 

The survey covers over 60 recent papers on text-to-3D, image-to-3D and video-to-3D tasks. It highlights innovations like optimizing neural radiance fields from text prompts, generating 3D humans from sketches, and producing dynamic 3D scenes from videos. 

The paper concludes by identifying open challenges around quality, efficiency, controllability and evaluation. It suggests directions like developing specialized 3D foundation models, and designing automated benchmarks for assessing geometric and texture fidelity.

Overall, this survey offers the most up-to-date analysis of the exponentially expanding AIGC-3D field. By systematically organizing recent literature and peering into the future, it provides indispensable guidance for both researchers and practitioners in this domain.
