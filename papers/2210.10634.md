# [RankT5: Fine-Tuning T5 for Text Ranking with Ranking Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10634)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively adapt powerful sequence-to-sequence models like T5 for text ranking tasks. Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates two model variants called RankT5 that can directly output ranking scores and be fine-tuned with ranking losses to optimize ranking performance. The key hypotheses tested are:1) Adapting the T5 architecture to directly output scores instead of text tokens will improve ranking performance compared to simply converting ranking to a text generation task. 2) Fine-tuning the adapted T5 models with specialized ranking losses like listwise softmax cross-entropy will further improve performance compared to losses like pointwise cross-entropy that treat each query-document independently.3) Models fine-tuned with ranking losses will generalize better to out-of-domain ranking tasks compared to models fine-tuned as classifiers.The core innovation is enabling powerful sequence-to-sequence models like T5 to natively support text ranking through both model architecture changes and use of ranking losses during fine-tuning. Experiments on standard datasets then validate the performance gains from this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing methods to fine-tune the T5 model for text ranking tasks. Specifically:- They propose two model structures based on T5 - an encoder-decoder model and an encoder-only model - that can directly output numerical ranking scores instead of text tokens. - They demonstrate how to fine-tune these models with different ranking losses like pairwise logistic loss and listwise softmax loss to directly optimize for ranking metrics.- Through experiments on MS MARCO and Natural Questions datasets, they show their proposed models fine-tuned with ranking losses can significantly outperform models fine-tuned with classification losses.- They find that models fine-tuned with listwise losses tend to generalize better to out-of-domain datasets in zero-shot evaluations compared to models fine-tuned with pointwise losses.In summary, the key contribution is adapting the T5 model for text ranking by enabling it to output numerical scores and fine-tuning it with specialized ranking losses to achieve better ranking performance. The proposed techniques help unleash the power of large pretrained language models like T5 for ranking tasks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in text ranking with pretrained language models:- This paper focuses specifically on using the T5 model for text ranking, whereas most prior work has focused on BERT-based models. There has been limited exploration on leveraging more powerful generative models like T5 despite their great success on many NLP tasks.- The paper proposes two novel model variants tailored for text ranking - an encoder-decoder structure and an encoder-only structure. This allows directly optimizing ranking metrics during training, unlike prior approaches that convert ranking to text generation.- The paper experiments with different ranking losses like pairwise, listwise, and polynomial losses. Most prior work uses pointwise losses for fine-tuning ranking models. Using more advanced ranking losses to supervise T5 training is novel.- The paper shows strong empirical gains over BERT baselines as well as prior T5 ranking models. The models also generalize better to out-of-domain datasets when trained with listwise losses. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.- Most prior work focuses on query-document ranking. This paper tackles passage ranking on MS MARCO and Natural Questions datasets. The techniques are directly applicable to document ranking but not explored in experiments.- For computational efficiency, some recent works propose late interaction models to avoid full attention between query-document terms. This paper uses standard cross-attention with full query-document interaction, so efficiency may be a limitation.Overall, the key novelty is in adapting T5 for text ranking and showing the benefits of using advanced ranking losses for fine-tuning. The techniques substantially advance the state-of-the-art in utilizing pretrained language models for ranking. More exploration of other model architectures and losses could be interesting future work.
