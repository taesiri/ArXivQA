# [CodePrompt: Improving Source Code-Related Classification with Knowledge   Features through Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Previous methods for source code classification rely solely on the [CLS] token from the top layer of BERT-based models, which only captures high-level semantic features. This lacks lower and middle level syntactic and linguistic features.  
- Adding extra layers like LSTM to extract more features leads to higher computational costs.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose CodePrompt, which uses prompt learning to stimulate rich knowledge from multiple layers of a BERT-based model.
- Wrap input text sequence into a prompt template and feed into CodeBERT to output knowledge related to the input at the [MASK] locations. 
- Use an attention mechanism to aggregate the importance of knowledge features from different layers.
- Avoid needing extra neural network layers for feature extraction.

Key Contributions:
- First work combining prompt learning with source code tasks, advancing software engineering.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on 4 source code tasks while reducing computational costs. 
- Comprehensive experiments on both programming language and natural language tasks demonstrate effectiveness.
- Ablation studies validate the contribution of both prompt and attention components.
- Analysis shows different tasks focus on different knowledge layers.
- Makes models and code publicly available to facilitate research.

In summary, CodePrompt innovatively uses prompt learning and attention mechanisms with a BERT-based model to stimulate and aggregate multi-layer knowledge features for enhanced source code classification, achieving top accuracy while lowering computational costs. Thorough experiments and analyses demonstrate its effectiveness on both programming and natural language tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes CodePrompt, a novel approach that leverages prompt learning and attention mechanisms with a pre-trained language model to improve source code classification tasks by aggregating important knowledge features from the model without needing additional neural network layers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper proposes a novel approach called CodePrompt that combines prompt learning and attention mechanism with a pre-trained language model (CodeBERT) to improve source code-related classification tasks. This is the first attempt to apply prompt learning to software engineering tasks.

2. CodePrompt utilizes the rich knowledge recalled from CodeBERT through prompt information as features to avoid needing additional neural network layers for feature extraction. This reduces computational costs. The attention mechanism is used to aggregate important knowledge layers for each task to enhance accuracy.

3. Extensive experiments on four source code tasks (code language classification, code smell classification, code comment classification, technical debt classification) show CodePrompt achieves new state-of-the-art results on accuracy while saving computation costs.

4. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of both the attention and prompt components. Analysis is provided on how different tasks focus on different knowledge layers.

5. The code and models have been open-sourced to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

In summary, the key innovation is using prompt learning and attention mechanism to exploit the knowledge inside CodeBERT more effectively for source code tasks, achieving better accuracy with lower computation cost. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the approach's effectiveness.
