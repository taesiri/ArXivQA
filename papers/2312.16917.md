# [Unified Lattice Graph Fusion for Chinese Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16917)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Unified Lattice Graph Fusion for Chinese Named Entity Recognition":

Problem:
- Chinese NER is challenging due to lack of explicit word boundaries in Chinese text. Using word segmentation before NER propagation errors. 
- Prior lexicon-enhanced methods integrate word information into character sequence using features weighting and position coupling, but ignore semantic and contextual correspondence between characters and words.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Unified Lattice Graph Fusion (ULGF) approach to model interactions between characters and words. 
- Convert lattice structure to a unified graph with characters and words as nodes, and semantic relations as edges. Two types of edges:
    - Intra-source edges between nodes of same source 
    - Inter-source edges between character and word nodes
- Stack multiple graph-based multi-source fusion layers to iteratively perform semantic interactions and learn node representations.
- Use self-attention for intra-source fusion, and cross-gating for inter-source fusion.
- Add auxiliary task of lexicon entity classification (LEC) to determine roles of matched words and alleviate disturbance.

Main Contributions:
- Model dense interactions between fine-grained semantic units in character-word space using a graph structure.
- Explicitly capture semantic and boundary relations between characters and words.  
- Iteratively perform multi-source semantic fusion using self-attention and cross-gating.
- Alleviate bias of disturbed words via auxiliary LEC task.
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on 4 Chinese NER datasets. Demonstrate efficiency and ability to exploit lexicon information.
