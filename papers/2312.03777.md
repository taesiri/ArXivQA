# [On the Robustness of Large Multimodal Models Against Image Adversarial   Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks, especially attacks targeted only on the visual encoder, has not been thoroughly examined. 

- This paper conducts a systematic study on the impact of visual adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art LMMs across tasks including image classification, captioning and VQA.

Methods:
- Evaluated LMMs: LLaVA, BLIP2-T5, InstructBLIP. Attacks: PGD, APGD, CW. Tasks: COCO classification (with/without context), COCO caption retrieval, VQA (VQA2, ScienceQA, TextVQA, POPE, MME).

- Adversarial examples crafted w.r.t. visual encoder only. For classification, attack target is image-to-text similarity. For captioning, attack target is mean caption embedding.  

Key Findings:
- LMMs are generally vulnerable to adversarial visual inputs, even if attacks target just the visual encoder. Performance degrades substantially on COCO classification and captioning.  

- However, LMMs show inherent robustness in VQA when the question content differs from what's being attacked in the image. Additional context also improves robustness.

- Proposes query decomposition for classification - asking existence questions about objects mitigates attack impact and improves accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of visual adversarial impact on LMMs across diverse tasks. Reveals vulnerability in some contexts and surprising robustness in others.

- Highlights the role of textual context/questions in mitigating visual attacks. Proposes query decomposition as a robust classification approach.

- Sets the stage for future research into adversarial attacks and defense strategies tailored to multimodal models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis on the robustness of current large multimodal models against various adversarial attacks on images, evaluated across tasks including image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering. It finds that while these models are generally vulnerable to adversarial visual inputs, providing additional contextual information can help mitigate the effects.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis on the robustness of current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) against various adversarial attacks, evaluated across tasks including image classification, image captioning, and Visual Question Answer (VQA). 

2) The paper finds that in general LMMs are not robust to adversarial visual inputs. However, the paper also observes that LMMs show decent robustness in VQA tasks when the visual attack does not directly target the question's focus.

3) The paper finds that adding additional textual context about the querying object improves LMMs' robustness against adversarial visual inputs.

4) Based on the above findings, the paper proposes a context-augmented image classification scheme using query decomposition that shows improved robustness over standard image classification.

In summary, the main contribution is a systematic study analyzing the impact of visual adversarial attacks on LMMs across different tasks, revealing when LMMs are vulnerable or robust, and proposing ways to improve robustness based on the insights uncovered. The paper sets the stage for future work on strengthening LMM resilience in adversarial settings.

The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis on the robustness of current state-of-the-art LMMs against different visual adversarial attacks, evaluated across tasks including image classification, image captioning, and VQA. Key findings suggest that while LMMs generally lack robustness to adversarial visual inputs, providing additional context in prompts can help mitigate such attacks.
