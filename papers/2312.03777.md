# [On the Robustness of Large Multimodal Models Against Image Adversarial   Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03777)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown impressive capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, their robustness against adversarial attacks, especially attacks targeted only on the visual encoder, has not been thoroughly examined. 

- This paper conducts a systematic study on the impact of visual adversarial attacks on state-of-the-art LMMs across tasks including image classification, captioning and VQA.

Methods:
- Evaluated LMMs: LLaVA, BLIP2-T5, InstructBLIP. Attacks: PGD, APGD, CW. Tasks: COCO classification (with/without context), COCO caption retrieval, VQA (VQA2, ScienceQA, TextVQA, POPE, MME).

- Adversarial examples crafted w.r.t. visual encoder only. For classification, attack target is image-to-text similarity. For captioning, attack target is mean caption embedding.  

Key Findings:
- LMMs are generally vulnerable to adversarial visual inputs, even if attacks target just the visual encoder. Performance degrades substantially on COCO classification and captioning.  

- However, LMMs show inherent robustness in VQA when the question content differs from what's being attacked in the image. Additional context also improves robustness.

- Proposes query decomposition for classification - asking existence questions about objects mitigates attack impact and improves accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of visual adversarial impact on LMMs across diverse tasks. Reveals vulnerability in some contexts and surprising robustness in others.

- Highlights the role of textual context/questions in mitigating visual attacks. Proposes query decomposition as a robust classification approach.

- Sets the stage for future research into adversarial attacks and defense strategies tailored to multimodal models.
