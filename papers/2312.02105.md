# [Authoring Worked Examples for Java Programming with Human-AI   Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Worked code examples with line-by-line explanations are very useful for learning programming but require a lot of effort for instructors to create. This leads to an "authoring bottleneck".
- Prior attempts to address this include learner sourcing explanations or extracting them from lecture videos, but these have had limited practical impact.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a collaborative human-AI authoring system where the instructor provides code + problem statement, and ChatGPT generates initial line-by-line explanations. 
- Instructor can then review, edit or override the AI-generated explanations before finalizing the worked example.

Authoring System Details:
- Built on top of existing PCEX system for presenting interactive worked examples.
- Carefully engineered the ChatGPT prompt through internal evaluation to balance conciseness vs having enough context. 
- Includes option for multi-round prompting to elicit additional explanations in second round.

Evaluation:
- Compared ChatGPT explanations to human expert-authored ones from PCEX system.
- 15 participants (mix of grad students and advanced undergrads) rated completeness and quality of explanations.
- ChatGPT scored very high on completeness and was rated as better than expert over 50% of the time.

Main Contributions:
- First attempt at human-AI collaborative authoring for worked code examples.
- Authoring tool that drastically reduces instructor effort to create examples.
- Analysis of prompt engineering for code explanations.
- Evidence that ChatGPT-generated explanations approach or exceed human expert quality.

Limitations and Future Work:
- Small study scale, plan to expand variety of examples and participants.
- Whether best prompt generalizes to examples of different difficulties. 
- Better define completeness and correctness metrics.
- Study real instructors using the system over a full semester.
