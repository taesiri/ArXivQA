# [Authoring Worked Examples for Java Programming with Human-AI   Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02105)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a worked example authoring tool that utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate line-by-line code explanations as a way to address the authoring bottleneck faced by instructors. The tool is designed for human-AI collaboration, where the instructor provides the code and problem description, and ChatGPT generates initial explanations that the instructor can then review and edit. Through an internal evaluation process, the authors tuned the ChatGPT prompt to optimize explanation quality. They then conducted an external evaluation where 15 advanced CS students and teaching assistants rated and compared ChatGPT-generated explanations to human-authored explanations from real course examples. Results showed that over 75% of ChatGPT explanations were rated as very complete, and over 50% were considered better than the human-authored ones. Despite some limitations in terms of sample size and prompt generalizability, this work provides strong evidence for the value of using ChatGPT in tools that facilitate the authoring of worked examples through human-AI collaboration. Key future work involves larger-scale classroom studies and further prompt optimization.
