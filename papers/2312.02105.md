# [Authoring Worked Examples for Java Programming with Human-AI   Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02105)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a worked example authoring tool that utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate line-by-line code explanations as a way to address the authoring bottleneck faced by instructors. The tool is designed for human-AI collaboration, where the instructor provides the code and problem description, and ChatGPT generates initial explanations that the instructor can then review and edit. Through an internal evaluation process, the authors tuned the ChatGPT prompt to optimize explanation quality. They then conducted an external evaluation where 15 advanced CS students and teaching assistants rated and compared ChatGPT-generated explanations to human-authored explanations from real course examples. Results showed that over 75% of ChatGPT explanations were rated as very complete, and over 50% were considered better than the human-authored ones. Despite some limitations in terms of sample size and prompt generalizability, this work provides strong evidence for the value of using ChatGPT in tools that facilitate the authoring of worked examples through human-AI collaboration. Key future work involves larger-scale classroom studies and further prompt optimization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a worked example authoring tool that utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate line-by-line code explanations through human-AI collaboration, evaluates the quality of the explanations through a user study, and discusses limitations and future work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of a worked example authoring tool that utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate line-by-line code explanations in a human-AI collaborative process. Specifically:

1) The paper presents a worked example authoring tool (WEAT) that allows instructors to provide code examples and problem descriptions, and leverages ChatGPT to generate initial drafts of line-by-line explanations that can then be reviewed and edited. This is designed to address the authoring bottleneck faced by instructors in creating interactive worked examples.

2) The paper describes an iterative process of internally evaluating different prompt formulations to identify design decisions that result in higher quality ChatGPT-generated explanations, such as including the problem description and using a two-round prompting approach.

3) The paper presents the results of an external evaluation study comparing explanations created through this human-AI collaborative approach to expert-authored explanations from the same code examples. The results show the ChatGPT explanations were rated to be as or more complete than expert explanations in over 78% of cases, and better than expert explanations in over 53% of cases.

4) The work provides empirical evidence for the viability of using large language models like ChatGPT to automatically generate initial drafts of code explanations that can accelerate the overall authoring process. The tool and collaborative approach have the potential to increase instructor authored interactive worked examples.

In summary, the core contribution is demonstrating and evaluating a human-AI collaborative approach for authoring worked code examples by integrating ChatGPT explanation generation capabilities within an interactive authoring tool.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, I would suggest the following key terms and keywords that are associated with this paper:

- Worked examples
- Authoring tool 
- Human-AI collaboration
- Code explanations
- Line-by-line explanations
- Prompt engineering
- ChatGPT
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Program comprehension
- Introductory programming education

The main focus of the paper is on developing an authoring tool for creating worked code examples that explains each line of code. The key idea is to utilize ChatGPT and leverage human-AI collaboration to generate the code explanations, instead of having human authors write explanations for every line manually. The paper discusses the process of engineering effective prompts for ChatGPT to produce high-quality explanations. It also presents an evaluation comparing ChatGPT-generated explanations versus human-authored explanations. So the main keywords cover these key aspects of the research.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a human-AI collaborative approach to authoring worked examples. Can you elaborate on why this approach was chosen over having just the human or just the AI generate the explanations? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this collaborative approach?

2. The paper uses ChatGPT as the AI engine to generate initial explanations. What were some of the key factors and tradeoffs considered when selecting ChatGPT over other language models? How might using a different language model impact the collaborative process?  

3. The paper describes an iterative prompt tuning process to arrive at a well-performing prompt format. Can you walk through this process in more detail and explain some of the key decisions made regarding factors like including a problem description and multi-round prompting? 

4. The authors use an internal evaluation process to assess different prompt formulations. Can you elaborate on the examples selected, the rating metrics used, and some of the key findings from this internal evaluation? What implications did this have on the final prompt design?

5. The external evaluation uses advanced students and teaching assistants as subjects rather than novices. What was the rationale behind this decision? How might the results have differed with novice evaluators? What are the tradeoffs?

6. Explain in detail the process used for the external evaluation, including the examples selected, the rating questions posed, and how explanations were compared. What analysis was performed on the ratings collected? 

7. The authors note several limitations of the evaluation performed. Can you expand on some of these limitations? How might they have impacted the results and conclusions of the study? What future work is needed to address them?  

8. One aspect not explored is allowing end users to modify the engineered prompt. What benefits or issues might arise from giving users this ability? How could this be evaluated effectively?

9. Overall, what do you see as the major open questions and areas for future work based on this research? What studies could provide further validation of the human-AI collaborative approach?

10. More broadly, how might the proposed collaborative authoring approach scale to larger volumes of content? What other applications beyond worked examples might benefit from a similar human-AI collaboration?
