# [Authoring Worked Examples for Java Programming with Human-AI   Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Worked code examples with line-by-line explanations are very useful for learning programming but require a lot of effort for instructors to create. This leads to an "authoring bottleneck".
- Prior attempts to address this include learner sourcing explanations or extracting them from lecture videos, but these have had limited practical impact.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a collaborative human-AI authoring system where the instructor provides code + problem statement, and ChatGPT generates initial line-by-line explanations. 
- Instructor can then review, edit or override the AI-generated explanations before finalizing the worked example.

Authoring System Details:
- Built on top of existing PCEX system for presenting interactive worked examples.
- Carefully engineered the ChatGPT prompt through internal evaluation to balance conciseness vs having enough context. 
- Includes option for multi-round prompting to elicit additional explanations in second round.

Evaluation:
- Compared ChatGPT explanations to human expert-authored ones from PCEX system.
- 15 participants (mix of grad students and advanced undergrads) rated completeness and quality of explanations.
- ChatGPT scored very high on completeness and was rated as better than expert over 50% of the time.

Main Contributions:
- First attempt at human-AI collaborative authoring for worked code examples.
- Authoring tool that drastically reduces instructor effort to create examples.
- Analysis of prompt engineering for code explanations.
- Evidence that ChatGPT-generated explanations approach or exceed human expert quality.

Limitations and Future Work:
- Small study scale, plan to expand variety of examples and participants.
- Whether best prompt generalizes to examples of different difficulties. 
- Better define completeness and correctness metrics.
- Study real instructors using the system over a full semester.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a worked example authoring tool that utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate line-by-line code explanations for instructors to review and edit, exploring a human-AI collaborative approach to reduce the authoring bottleneck of creating interactive code examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the introduction and evaluation of a worked example authoring tool that utilizes ChatGPT to automatically generate line-by-line code explanations through human-AI collaboration. Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a worked example authoring system that allows instructors to provide code examples and problem statements, and leverages ChatGPT to generate initial explanations for each line of code. Instructors can then review, edit, and refine the AI-generated explanations as needed.

2) The prompting approach for ChatGPT is engineered through an iterative internal evaluation process to produce high-quality explanations. This includes decisions such as including the problem description, using a two-round prompting approach, and not including explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria.

3) The quality of the ChatGPT-generated explanations is evaluated through a user study with 15 advanced students and teaching assistants. The study finds that the AI-generated explanations are rated as more complete than human-authored expert explanations over 80% of the time. The AI explanations are also rated as better than the expert explanations over 50% of the time.

4) The tool and evaluation support a human-AI collaborative approach to authoring worked examples, where the AI performs the time-intensive work of providing initial explanations, and humans provide oversight, refinement, and quality control. This approach could help alleviate the authoring bottleneck faced by many instructors.

In summary, the main contribution is providing and evaluating a method and tool for automatic generation of worked example code explanations to support faster human-AI collaborative authoring.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a human-AI collaborative approach to authoring worked code examples. Can you explain in detail how the collaboration between humans and AI works in this approach? What are the respective roles of the human author and the AI?  

2. The authors use ChatGPT to generate the initial draft of line-by-line code explanations. Why did they choose ChatGPT over other language models? What specific capabilities of ChatGPT make it suitable for this task?

3. The study relies on carefully engineered prompts to guide ChatGPT in generating high-quality explanations. Can you explain what considerations went into designing an effective prompt? How was the prompt iteratively improved through internal evaluation?

4. The authors make the case that prospective authors (instructors and TAs) are the most suitable evaluators of the AI-generated explanations. Do you agree with this argument? Why or why not? What unique insights can instructor evaluations provide?

5. One finding from the internal evaluation was that including a program description in the prompt sometimes led to lower quality explanations. What might explain this counterintuitive result? How did the authors address this issue?

6. The paper evaluates the completeness and relative quality of AI vs human-authored explanations. Based on the results, do you think the proposed approach successfully addressed the authoring bottleneck problem? What evidence supports your view?

7. The authors identify several limitations of the study, including small sample size and lack of formal definitions for ratings. If you were to extend this research, what would be your high priority next steps? Why?  

8. The paper does not evaluate end-user perceptions of explanations authored via human-AI collaboration. Why would instructor and student perceptions be an important measure for future studies? What open questions remain?

9. Could the benefits of this approach extend beyond authoring worked code examples? What other applications of human-AI collaboration in education does this work inspire you to consider?

10. What do you see as the most significant open challenges or barriers that need to be addressed before human-AI collaboration could be broadly adopted by instructors and content authors?
