# [Generalisable Agents for Neural Network Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18598)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GANNO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for optimizing deep neural networks. It employs one agent per layer to observe local dynamics and accordingly adjust layerwise learning rates, with the goal of improving global performance. Experiments demonstrate that GANNO can learn useful and responsive schedules, competitive with popular hand-tuned heuristics. It also shows signs of generalization, performing well when evaluated on deeper networks and more complex datasets than seen during training. Ablations highlight the necessity of the MARL formulation, validating the use of layerwise observations and actions. While challenges remain regarding foresight, credit assignment, and compute requirements, the paradigm shows promise as agents leverage both layerwise information and the power of dynamic scheduling. Overall, GANNO offers a novel, competitive, and scalable approach to neural network optimization, with opportunities for impactful future work through this agent-based learning paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework called GANNO that trains an agent per layer of a neural network to observe local dynamics and accordingly adjust layerwise learning rates over time, demonstrating the potential to generate responsive optimization schedules that improve performance and generalize across network architectures and datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing GANNO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for dynamically scheduling the layerwise learning rates of a neural network during training. Specifically:

- GANNO uses one agent per layer of the neural network. Each agent observes local layer dynamics as well as global training metrics, and takes actions to adjust the learning rate of its corresponding layer. 

- Through experiments, the paper shows that GANNO can learn useful and responsive learning rate schedules that are competitive with popular hand-designed schedules. 

- The paper demonstrates signs of generalization - GANNO is trained on simple networks and datasets but can still perform well when evaluated on more complex networks and datasets. This removes the need to know good hyperparameter values a priori.

- The ablation studies highlight the importance of the multi-agent formulation, where observing and operating at a layerwise level is useful for learning good schedules.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting GANNO as a novel MARL paradigm for neural network optimization that is adaptive, robust, and generalizable while avoiding problem-specific heuristics or excessively large compute budgets. The paper analyzes the strengths as well as core challenges of this approach.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Generalisable Agents for Neural Network Optimisation (GANNO): The proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to dynamically control hyperparameters like learning rate during neural network training.

- Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL): GANNO utilizes a decentralized MARL approach with a separate "agent" controlling each layer of the neural network.

- Layerwise learning rates: Unlike prior RL approaches for optimisation that use a single global learning rate, GANNO sets a separate learning rate per layer based on local observations.  

- Generalisation: Key goal of GANNO is to generalise - i.e. work effectively when evaluated on neural networks and datasets different/harder than the training environment.

- Robustness: Related to generalisation, refers to GANNO performing consistently well across a range of unseen initial conditions like initial learning rate, weight decay etc.

- Responsiveness: GANNO agents dynamically adjust layerwise learning rates based on observed training dynamics, helping escape local optima.

- Computational efficiency: Unlike some learned optimisers, GANNO is relatively efficient to train, enabling further development and accessibility.

- Challenges: Key issues identified include enabling better agent foresight, designing meaningful rewards, and reducing computational requirements.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach called GANNO for neural network optimization. What are some key benefits of using a MARL approach compared to a single-agent approach? How does the layerwise formulation in GANNO help with learning better optimization schedules?

2. The paper shows signs of generalization, where GANNO is able to optimize networks more complex than what it was trained on. What factors enable this generalization capability and how can it be further improved? Are there any failure cases or limitations?

3. The paper identifies the need for agent foresight as a key challenge. Why is foresight important for learning effective optimization schedules? How can we provide better demonstrations or shape rewards to teach agents the benefits of "warmup" schedules?  

4. The paper uses a difference reward to help with the credit assignment problem. What other techniques from multi-agent RL could help agents better understand the impact of their actions? How else can we design more meaningful reward signals?

5. The observations provided to the agents include both global and layer-specific statistics. What other statistics could provide useful signals about the optimization process? How can we balance providing relevant information without making the observation space too large?

6. The scheduling framework focuses on learning rate, but could be extended to other hyperparameters like weight decay. What are some challenges in jointly optimizing multiple hyperparameters? Would new types of observations or actions help?

7. The paper shows strong performance on vision datasets like CIFAR-10. How well would GANNO generalize to other data modalities like text or graph data? What adaptations would be required?

8. What types of neural network architectures could GANNO struggle to optimize effectively? For example, Transformers have complex attention mechanisms. Would GANNO need architecture-specific customization? 

9. The training time and compute for GANNO is discussed as more feasible than learned optimizers like VeLO. However, 50k timesteps is still substantial. How could we reduce the training time further?

10. The paper focuses on a supervised learning setting inside the MARL environment. What are some other potential applications for using MARL to optimize neural network training?
