# [Torch.manual_seed(3407) is all you need: On the influence of random   seeds in deep learning architectures for computer vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08203)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions it addresses are:

1. What is the distribution of scores (accuracy) with respect to the choice of random seed in deep learning models for computer vision? 

2. Are there "black swan" seeds that produce radically different (better or worse) results compared to most other seeds? 

3. Does pretraining on larger datasets mitigate the variability in results induced by the choice of random seed?

The overall goal seems to be to analyze the effect of random seed selection on model accuracy across different computer vision tasks and model architectures. The author scans a large number of random seeds (up to 10,000) to test whether seed selection can lead to significant variability in accuracy, which could potentially invalidate or exaggerate results. The study aims to quantify this variability and determine if factors like pretraining mitigate it.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that random seed selection can substantially impact measured model accuracy across different computer vision setups, and the author systematically tests this hypothesis through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be an investigation into the effect of random seed selection on the accuracy of deep learning models for computer vision tasks. The key points are:

- The author tested a large number of random seeds (up to 10,000) with various deep learning architectures on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. 

- Even though the variance across different seeds was not very large, it was easy to find "outlier" seeds that performed much better or worse than average. 

- On CIFAR-10, a difference of ~2% accuracy was observed just by selecting different random seeds. This is considered a significant difference in the computer vision community.

- On ImageNet, a ~0.5% accuracy difference was seen across seeds even when using the same pretrained model. This is still viewed as significant for ImageNet.

- The author argues that many recent computer vision papers likely report results that are partly due to lucky seed selection, rather than just the merits of the method itself. 

- The paper recommends that authors perform more rigorous analyses by reporting performance over multiple random seeds/dataset splits to determine significance.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that performance differences attributed to algorithmic changes in computer vision papers may often be partly or fully explained by just the choice of random seed. The author advocates for more rigorous experimental practices.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper investigates the effect of random seed selection on the performance of deep learning models for computer vision tasks. The main finding is that even small variations in the random seed can produce significant differences in model accuracy, suggesting current practices may overstate performance due to "lucky" seed selection.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in computer vision and deep learning:

- The focus on analyzing the impact of random seeds is quite novel. Most CV papers report results from only 1-2 runs and don't investigate seed variability in depth. This paper takes an empirical approach to quantifying seed influence.

- The scale of the experiments, with 10,000 seeds tested on CIFAR-10, is impressive. Many seed analysis papers use smaller datasets like MNIST or fewer runs. The ImageNet experiments are more limited but still cover 50 seeds.

- The models and accuracies are reasonably strong but not state-of-the-art. As the author acknowledges, testing seeds on the best possible models would give a more definitive picture. But the experiments are solid for the compute budget.

- The analysis of seed influence even after convergence is an interesting angle. Many assume training for longer removes variability, but this paper shows stable variation after convergence.

- Finding "black swan" high and low performing seeds highlights the risk of reporting only best scores, common practice in many papers. But the distributions are relatively stable, alleviating some concerns.

- Using self-supervised pretraining on ImageNet is a relevant experimental setup given the popularity of SSL techniques recently. The observed seed variance is worryingly high for a fixed pretrained model.

Overall, while limited in scale, I think the paper makes a useful contribution to the understanding of randomness in vision models. The analysis is generally rigorous and the conclusions, while preliminary, highlight the need for further investigation into reproducibility. It connects well to the broader discussion on rigor in ML research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Performing more robust studies on the influence of random seeds, scanning a very large number of seeds (10^4 to 10^5) with large state-of-the-art models trained from scratch. This would provide more empirical data on what should be considered statistically significant results versus just noise.

- The community adopting more rigorous experimental practices, including performing randomness studies by varying seeds and dataset splits. Authors should report average, standard deviation, minimum and maximum scores over multiple runs. 

- Exploring the distribution of scores more thoroughly, including computing higher order moments beyond just mean and standard deviation. This could reveal more insights into the shape of the distribution.

- Testing whether the variance in results due to random seeds decreases as models achieve higher accuracy, or if the variability persists. More experiments at greater scales are needed.

- Evaluating whether certain seeds are intrinsically "better" than others, even after convergence. This could have implications for deliberately selecting good seeds.

- Expanding the study to other domains beyond computer vision that rely heavily on deep learning. Assessing the effect of random seeds in areas like NLP.

- Developing techniques to mitigate the sensitivity to random seeds, making models more robust and results more consistent across seeds. This could include new regularization methods or training procedures.

In summary, the authors call for more rigorous analysis of the influence of random factors like seeds on model performance across computer vision and deep learning. They suggest this is needed to separate true progress from variability caused by randomness.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper investigates the effects of random seed selection on the accuracy of deep learning models for computer vision. It examines the distribution of model accuracy over different random seeds, finding that the distribution is fairly concentrated around the mean, but that it is possible to find outlier seeds that produce significantly higher or lower accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with 10,000 seeds found a gap of 1.82% between best and worst accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet with pretrained models and 50 seeds still found a 0.5% accuracy gap, which is considered significant. The paper argues that many computer vision results may be overstated due to implicit "lucky" seed selection during model tuning. It recommends authors rigorously study the effects of randomness by varying seeds and dataset splits. Overall, the paper shows random seed selection can significantly impact accuracy of vision models, and more rigor is needed when reporting results.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper examines the effect of random seed selection on the accuracy of popular deep learning architectures for computer vision tasks. The author tests a large number of random seeds (up to 10,000) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a ResNet model, and 50 seeds on ImageNet using pretrained ResNet and Visual Transformer models. The key findings are:

On CIFAR-10, the distribution of accuracies across seeds is concentrated but there are "outlier" seeds that produce accuracy significantly higher or lower than average. A difference of up to 1.82% accuracy is observed just by changing the seed. On ImageNet, pretrained models exhibit smaller variance across seeds (0.1-0.11% standard deviation) but the gap between minimum and maximum accuracy is still around 0.5%, which is considered significant. Overall, the results indicate that randomness induced by seed selection can substantially impact accuracy, even for large models on big datasets. The author argues that the computer vision community should be more rigorous about reporting performance over multiple runs with different seeds to establish statistical validity of results.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper investigates the effect of random seed selection on the accuracy of deep learning models for computer vision tasks. The main method is to train models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets using different random seeds, ranging from 500 seeds for the CIFAR-10 long training setup to 10,000 seeds for the CIFAR-10 short training setup. For ImageNet, 50 seeds are used with three different architectures - standard ResNet50, self-supervised ResNet50, and self-supervised ViT. The models are trained and the validation accuracy distribution across seeds is analyzed to determine the variance and presence of outlier "black swan" seeds that perform much better or worse. The goal is to quantify the effect of the random seed on accuracy to see if it is significant enough to warrant more rigorous reporting of results across multiple seeds in computer vision publications.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main questions it is addressing are:

1. What is the distribution of model performance (scores/accuracy) with respect to the choice of random seed used for training? 

2. Are there "black swan" seeds that produce radically different (much better or worse) results compared to typical seeds?

3. Does pretraining on larger datasets mitigate the variability in results induced by the choice of random seed?

The paper is investigating the effect of the choice of random seed on model performance in computer vision tasks. This matters because many recent papers in this field report results from just a single run, without testing the statistical robustness across multiple random seeds. The paper aims to quantify the variability induced by the random seed alone, to see if this effect is significant compared to what is considered state-of-the-art improvement in common benchmarks.

The main focus of the paper is investigating the effect of random seed selection on the accuracy of deep learning models for computer vision tasks. It examines the variability in results based on different random seeds, and questions whether some seeds produce significantly better or worse performance. The goals are to characterize the distribution of scores across seeds, identify any "outlier" seeds, and see if pretraining on larger datasets reduces this variability. 

The experiments involve training convolutional and transformer models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet while scanning through thousands of different random seeds. The key findings are that there can be nearly 2% difference in accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 0.5% on ImageNet just due to the choice of seed, which are considered significant differences in computer vision. This suggests issues with only reporting a single run in publications, and not properly accounting for the variability induced by random factors like seeds.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper scans a large number of random seeds on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet to analyze the effect of seed selection on model accuracy. However, the architectures and training procedures used are not state-of-the-art. Could the variability induced by the random seed be lower if more optimal models were used?

2. The paper acknowledges the training time limitations that prevented using state-of-the-art models. If compute budget was not an issue, what experiments could be run to more thoroughly analyze the effect of random seeds?

3. On CIFAR-10, a difference of up to 1.82% accuracy is observed just by changing the random seed. Is this variability concerning even if absolute accuracy is not state-of-the-art? Could this difference potentially be even larger with better models?

4. For ImageNet, only 50 seeds were tested due to compute constraints. Is 50 seeds enough to reliably estimate variability in accuracy? Would scanning 10,000+ seeds on ImageNet potentially reveal larger gaps as observed on CIFAR-10? 

5. The paper suggests some computer vision results may be overstated due to implicit "lucky" seed selection through trial and error hyperparameter tuning. Do you think this is a fair assessment? How prevalent could this issue potentially be?

6. The variability induced by the random seed seems to persist even after convergence. Why might the relative ranking of seeds be stable even after extensive training?

7. The paper recommends authors perform more rigorous analysis by reporting statistics over multiple runs. What specific experimental methodology could be adopted to minimize the influence of random seeds?

8. For ImageNet experiments, all models shared the same pretrained weights except for the last layer. Why does non-trivial variability still arise just from batch order randomization?

9. The paper argues that peer review and competition induces an "evolutionary pressure" that could lead to implicit optimization of seeds. Do you think changes to the review process could help mitigate this? 

10. The paper calls for more rigorous large-scale studies on the effect of random seeds. What challenges need to be overcome to make such studies feasible and widely adopted?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the effect of random seed selection on accuracy when using popular deep learning architectures for computer vision tasks. The author scans a large number of seeds (up to 10,000) on CIFAR-10 and also scans fewer seeds on ImageNet using pre-trained models. The main findings are:

1) The distribution of accuracy scores with respect to seed selection is relatively concentrated around the mean, with some seeds leading to intrinsically better results than others. 

2) There exist "black swan" seeds that produce accuracy scores much higher or lower than average, with a difference of up to 2% found by scanning 10,000 CIFAR-10 seeds. This is considered a significant difference in computer vision.

3) Using pretrained models and larger datasets like ImageNet reduces variability from seed selection, but differences around 0.5% accuracy still occur which is considered significant for ImageNet. 

Overall, the paper shows it is surprisingly easy to find seeds that produce outliers in accuracy, either high or low. This indicates a lack of robustness and potential overstatement of results in papers that report only a single run. The author recommends using multiple runs with different seeds and reporting aggregation statistics to improve rigor. Limitations include small model size and budget constraints compared to state-of-the-art computer vision work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the effect of random seed selection on accuracy of deep learning models for computer vision tasks, finding that there can be significant variability in accuracy due to the choice of seed alone.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper investigates the effect of random seed selection on the accuracy of popular deep learning models for computer vision tasks. The author scans a large number of seeds on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet using various architectures to determine the distribution of scores, identify outlier "black swan" seeds that produce very different results, and assess whether pretraining on larger datasets mitigates variability. Key findings are that while score distributions are relatively concentrated, differences of 0.5-2% accuracy due to seed selection alone are possible, which exceeds typical thresholds for claimed improvements. Though variability reduces somewhat with pretraining and larger datasets, concerning differences remain. The author argues the computer vision community should adopt more rigorous experimental methods like seed scans and multiple runs to ensure robustness. Overall, the paper casts doubt on whether some recent performance gains in the field may simply stem from implicit "lucky" seed selection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The author scans up to 10,000 random seeds on CIFAR-10 to analyze the effect of randomness on model performance. What are some limitations of only evaluating up to 10,000 seeds, and how could the conclusions change if even more seeds were evaluated (e.g. 100,000 or 1 million)?

2. For the ImageNet experiments, the author only evaluates 50 random seeds due to computational constraints. How might the conclusions change if hundreds or thousands of seeds were evaluated instead? What are some ways the author could have designed the experiments to evaluate more seeds given the computational budget?

3. The models used achieve decent but not state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. How might the variability induced by the random seed change for models that achieve higher accuracy? Could the conclusions be different for state-of-the-art models?

4. The author acknowledges the tradeoff between model accuracy and training time when selecting model architectures. How might model selection focused more on accuracy rather than training speed have affected the results and conclusions?

5. Could the variability induced by the random seed depend on the specific model architecture used? How could the author have analyzed the impact of model architecture choice on the results?

6. The training procedures, hyperparameters, and schedules are kept simple to fit the computational budget. How might more extensive hyperparameter tuning affect the variability induced by the random seed?

7. The author analyzes the impact of randomness on validation accuracy. How might the conclusions change if other metrics like training loss, robustness, or calibration were analyzed instead?

8. For ImageNet, only the classifier layer is trained from scratch while earlier layers are frozen. How could end-to-end fine-tuning versus only training the classifier change the variability? 

9. The author focuses on the random seed, but how might other sources of randomness like data ordering, parameter initialization, or dropout affect the results and conclusions?

10. The author suggests reproducibility could be improved by reporting statistics over multiple runs. What other techniques like proper validation schemes could also improve reproducibility and robustness to randomness?
