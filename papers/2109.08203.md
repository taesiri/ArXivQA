# [Torch.manual_seed(3407) is all you need: On the influence of random   seeds in deep learning architectures for computer vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08203)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions it addresses are:1. What is the distribution of scores (accuracy) with respect to the choice of random seed in deep learning models for computer vision? 2. Are there "black swan" seeds that produce radically different (better or worse) results compared to most other seeds? 3. Does pretraining on larger datasets mitigate the variability in results induced by the choice of random seed?The overall goal seems to be to analyze the effect of random seed selection on model accuracy across different computer vision tasks and model architectures. The author scans a large number of random seeds (up to 10,000) to test whether seed selection can lead to significant variability in accuracy, which could potentially invalidate or exaggerate results. The study aims to quantify this variability and determine if factors like pretraining mitigate it.In summary, the central hypothesis is that random seed selection can substantially impact measured model accuracy across different computer vision setups, and the author systematically tests this hypothesis through extensive experiments.
