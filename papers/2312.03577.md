# [Improving Bias Mitigation through Bias Experts in Natural Language   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03577)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel debiasing framework called "bias experts" to improve the performance of existing debiasing methods for natural language understanding models. The key idea is to introduce intermediate binary classifiers between the auxiliary bias detection model and the main model. Specifically, bias experts are binary classifiers that identify biased examples within a specific class, trained via a One-vs-Rest approach. This focuses each expert on learning the bias attributes of its target class without influence from other classes. The bias experts are trained to highlight "easy" biased examples from the target class, further amplifying the bias. During main model training, the predictions of the bias experts are used to reweight examples. Experiments across natural language inference, fact verification, and paraphrasing tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in out-of-distribution evaluation sets over state-of-the-art debiasing approaches. The gains mainly stem from improved bias identification from avoiding the detrimental effects of the multi-class loss. Ablations validate the efficacy of key components like binary training and bias amplification. Limitations include potential large memory overhead as the number of classes increases. Overall, the bias experts framework effectively improves existing debiasing methods by enhancing auxiliary model bias learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new debiasing framework that introduces binary classifiers called "bias experts" between the auxiliary model and main model to improve bias mitigation methods by overcoming limitations of the multi-class learning objective used to train the auxiliary model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new debiasing framework that introduces binary classifiers called "bias experts" between the auxiliary model and the main model to improve bias mitigation methods. Specifically, the key ideas are:

1) Using the One-vs-Rest approach to train individual bias experts to focus on learning the bias attributes of their target class without influence from other classes. 

2) Highlighting "easy" biased examples of the target classes for each bias expert, allowing them to concentrate more on learning the bias attributes.

3) Training the main model by reweighting the loss of examples using the predictions from the bias experts to mitigate bias.

Through experiments on various datasets, the paper shows that introducing bias experts consistently improves debiasing performance over state-of-the-art methods.
