# [Improving Bias Mitigation through Bias Experts in Natural Language   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03577)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel debiasing framework called "bias experts" to improve the performance of existing debiasing methods for natural language understanding models. The key idea is to introduce intermediate binary classifiers between the auxiliary bias detection model and the main model. Specifically, bias experts are binary classifiers that identify biased examples within a specific class, trained via a One-vs-Rest approach. This focuses each expert on learning the bias attributes of its target class without influence from other classes. The bias experts are trained to highlight "easy" biased examples from the target class, further amplifying the bias. During main model training, the predictions of the bias experts are used to reweight examples. Experiments across natural language inference, fact verification, and paraphrasing tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in out-of-distribution evaluation sets over state-of-the-art debiasing approaches. The gains mainly stem from improved bias identification from avoiding the detrimental effects of the multi-class loss. Ablations validate the efficacy of key components like binary training and bias amplification. Limitations include potential large memory overhead as the number of classes increases. Overall, the bias experts framework effectively improves existing debiasing methods by enhancing auxiliary model bias learning.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in data rather than learning the true underlying patterns. This leads to poor generalization on out-of-distribution data.
- Existing debiasing methods use an auxiliary model to identify biased examples. However, training the auxiliary model with a multi-class objective can harm its ability to identify biases due to: (1) a regularization effect that prevents overfitting to biases, and (2) a competitive nature across classes caused by softmax normalization.

Proposed Solution:  
- Introduce "bias experts", which are binary classifiers, between the auxiliary model and main model. 
- Convert the multi-class problem into multiple binary classification problems using a One-vs-Rest approach. This allows each bias expert to focus on biased examples of its target class without influence from other classes.
- Train each bias expert by down-weighting loss on easy examples of its target class to amplify bias learning. Upsample hard examples of non-target classes to prevent learning their biases.  
- Merge predictions of all bias experts and use that to reweight examples when training the main model, similar to prior work.

Main Contributions:
- Identify issues with using a multi-class objective for the auxiliary model in debiasing methods.
- Propose bias experts framework to address these issues by learning biases independently for each class using binary classification. 
- Show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art debiasing methods on multiple NLP tasks and an image classification task.
- Analysis provides insights into importance of different components and how the bias experts identify biased vs. unbiased examples better than prior auxiliary models.

In summary, the key innovation is the introduction of independent bias experts to overcome detrimental effects of the multi-class objective on learning biases. This improves debiasing ability and out-of-distribution generalization across multiple tasks.
