# [Improving Bias Mitigation through Bias Experts in Natural Language   Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03577)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel debiasing framework called "bias experts" to improve the performance of existing debiasing methods for natural language understanding models. The key idea is to introduce intermediate binary classifiers between the auxiliary bias detection model and the main model. Specifically, bias experts are binary classifiers that identify biased examples within a specific class, trained via a One-vs-Rest approach. This focuses each expert on learning the bias attributes of its target class without influence from other classes. The bias experts are trained to highlight "easy" biased examples from the target class, further amplifying the bias. During main model training, the predictions of the bias experts are used to reweight examples. Experiments across natural language inference, fact verification, and paraphrasing tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in out-of-distribution evaluation sets over state-of-the-art debiasing approaches. The gains mainly stem from improved bias identification from avoiding the detrimental effects of the multi-class loss. Ablations validate the efficacy of key components like binary training and bias amplification. Limitations include potential large memory overhead as the number of classes increases. Overall, the bias experts framework effectively improves existing debiasing methods by enhancing auxiliary model bias learning.
