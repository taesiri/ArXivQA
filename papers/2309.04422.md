# [Video Task Decathlon: Unifying Image and Video Tasks in Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04422)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How can we develop a unified neural network architecture and training approach that is capable of handling a diverse set of heterogeneous visual recognition tasks for autonomous driving using only a single model?The authors argue that current approaches focus on designing specialized networks for individual tasks, but a unified architecture that can jointly perform classification, segmentation, localization and association of objects and pixels would be much more computationally efficient and better leverage shared representations. To explore this, they propose the Visual Task Decathlon (VTD) challenge involving 10 representative vision tasks on images and videos. They also develop a network called VTDNet that uses a single structure and set of weights to output predictions for all tasks. A key aspect is the use of curriculum learning, pseudo-labeling and fine-tuning to enable successful joint training. The central hypothesis is that the proposed VTD challenge and VTDNet model will demonstrate the viability and benefits of unifying heterogeneous perception tasks in a single network, bringing us closer to human-level visual perception capabilities. The experiments aim to validate if the unified model can outperform specialized single-task networks while using fewer computational resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing a new challenge called the Visual Task Decathlon (VTD) for studying heterogeneous multi-task learning. VTD consists of 10 representative vision tasks spanning classification, segmentation, localization and association.2. Proposing a unified network architecture called VTDNet that uses a single set of weights to tackle all 10 VTD tasks. VTDNet groups similar tasks, enables feature interaction within and between groups, and uses lightweight decoders. 3. Designing a training scheme called CPF (Curriculum, Pseudo-labeling, Fine-tuning) to handle the difficulties of joint optimization on diverse tasks with varying annotation densities.4. Achieving strong performance on the VTD challenge. VTDNet outperforms single-task and multi-task baselines on most tasks while using 5x fewer computations. This demonstrates the promise of unified networks for perception tasks.In summary, the main contribution is introducing the VTD challenge and VTDNet model to explore unified representations for major 2D vision tasks in a computationally efficient manner. The results show this is a promising direction for heterogeneous multi-task learning.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper introduces the Visual Task Decathlon challenge, consisting of ten diverse image and video recognition tasks, to study unified representation learning for autonomous driving and proposes a unified network VTDNet and training method to tackle the tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on unified heterogeneous visual perception models for autonomous driving:- Network Architecture: The proposed VTDNet architecture employs a hierarchical design to handle diverse tasks, grouping similar tasks and using lightweight decoders. This is different from many prior works that use a simple shared encoder-decoder structure. The use of feature interaction blocks is also novel for exchanging knowledge between tasks.- Task Diversity: The Visual Task Decathlon benchmark comprises 10 distinct vision tasks spanning classification, segmentation, localization and association. This is much more diverse than existing MTL datasets like Cityscapes, Taskonomy, or PASCAL VOC that focus on segmentation tasks.- Realistic Scale: VTDNet is evaluated on the large-scale BDD100K driving dataset which has 100K videos. Many prior works use smaller datasets like KITTI or nuScenes. The video setting and scale make VTD more realistic.- Training Scheme: The CPF training protocol (curriculum-pseudo-finetuning) is specifically designed to handle the complexities of jointly training on the diverse VTD tasks and data. Using curriculum pre-training, pseudo-labels, and task-specific finetuning helps overcome optimization difficulties.- Evaluation Metric: The paper proposes a new metric VTDA to better evaluate performance on the heterogeneous tasks by grouping and normalizing. This accounts for differences in metrics and sensitivities.Overall, the unified architecture, large-scale video benchmark, and sophisticated training scheme make this work unique compared to prior MTL research focused on smaller homogeneous tasks. The idea of jointly handling all major 2D perception tasks with a single model is an important direction for real-world robotic systems.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:- Investigating neural networks that can perform long-term reasoning or prediction: The paper notes that the VTD benchmark focuses on tasks that require spatial or short-term temporal understanding, but lacks tasks involving long-term reasoning or prediction (e.g. action recognition, trajectory prediction). Extending the research to such tasks could be valuable.- Incorporating 3D or multi-camera tasks: The VTD benchmark is currently limited to 2D monocular video tasks. The authors suggest expanding it to incorporate 3D or multi-camera tasks to further increase diversity.- Exploring different model architectures: The authors' VTDNet represents an initial attempt at a unified architecture, but they suggest exploring other architectures could lead to further gains. This includes different ways to model task interactions and incorporate temporal information.- Developing more sophisticated training strategies: The authors designed a CPF training scheme, but suggest more advanced schemes may be needed as the complexity and number of tasks grows. This could involve things like more adaptive loss weighting, dynamic task selection, etc.- Expanding to additional tasks: The authors focused on 10 tasks, but suggest the benchmark could be expanded to even more tasks to better approximate real-world requirements.- Addressing model limitations: The paper discusses limitations around aspects like long-term reasoning, 3D sensing, bias/fairness issues, etc. Developing techniques to address these limitations represents an important research direction.In summary, the authors point to many opportunities for advancing unified representations through extensions to the model architecture, training procedures, tasks covered, and overall capabilities. Moving closer to human-level perception is the overarching challenge motivating these suggested research directions.
