# [Video Task Decathlon: Unifying Image and Video Tasks in Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04422)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is: How can we develop a unified neural network architecture and training approach that is capable of handling a diverse set of heterogeneous visual recognition tasks for autonomous driving using only a single model?The authors argue that current approaches focus on designing specialized networks for individual tasks, but a unified architecture that can jointly perform classification, segmentation, localization and association of objects and pixels would be much more computationally efficient and better leverage shared representations. To explore this, they propose the Visual Task Decathlon (VTD) challenge involving 10 representative vision tasks on images and videos. They also develop a network called VTDNet that uses a single structure and set of weights to output predictions for all tasks. A key aspect is the use of curriculum learning, pseudo-labeling and fine-tuning to enable successful joint training. The central hypothesis is that the proposed VTD challenge and VTDNet model will demonstrate the viability and benefits of unifying heterogeneous perception tasks in a single network, bringing us closer to human-level visual perception capabilities. The experiments aim to validate if the unified model can outperform specialized single-task networks while using fewer computational resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing a new challenge called the Visual Task Decathlon (VTD) for studying heterogeneous multi-task learning. VTD consists of 10 representative vision tasks spanning classification, segmentation, localization and association.2. Proposing a unified network architecture called VTDNet that uses a single set of weights to tackle all 10 VTD tasks. VTDNet groups similar tasks, enables feature interaction within and between groups, and uses lightweight decoders. 3. Designing a training scheme called CPF (Curriculum, Pseudo-labeling, Fine-tuning) to handle the difficulties of joint optimization on diverse tasks with varying annotation densities.4. Achieving strong performance on the VTD challenge. VTDNet outperforms single-task and multi-task baselines on most tasks while using 5x fewer computations. This demonstrates the promise of unified networks for perception tasks.In summary, the main contribution is introducing the VTD challenge and VTDNet model to explore unified representations for major 2D vision tasks in a computationally efficient manner. The results show this is a promising direction for heterogeneous multi-task learning.
