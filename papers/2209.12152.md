# [All are Worth Words: A ViT Backbone for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12152)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be whether a vision transformer (ViT) architecture can serve as an effective backbone model for diffusion models in image generation tasks, as an alternative to convolutional neural network (CNN) based models like U-Net. 

The key hypotheses seem to be:

- Treating all inputs (time steps, conditions, image patches) as tokens in a transformer framework can work well for diffusion models.

- Employing long skip connections between shallow and deep layers in a ViT model, similar to U-Net, is crucial for strong performance on image generation. 

- The proposed ViT-based architecture ("U-ViT") can achieve comparable or superior performance to U-Net backbones for diffusion models in tasks like unconditional image generation, class-conditional generation, and text-to-image generation.

- The downsampling/upsampling operators commonly used in CNN backbones like U-Net may not be necessary components for diffusion models applied to image generation. The long skip connections seem more important.

So in summary, the central question is whether ViT can effectively replace CNNs for diffusion model backbones in generative image modeling, which challenges the standard reliance on CNNs. And the key hypothesis is that a properly-designed ViT model with long skip connections can work just as well or better than CNNs for this application. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis across different generative modeling tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing U-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT) based backbone architecture for diffusion models in image generation tasks. 

The key aspects of U-ViT are:

- It treats all inputs including time, condition, and noisy image patches as tokens, following the standard transformer design. 

- It uses long skip connections between shallow and deep layers, inspired by U-Net architectures commonly used in diffusion models.

- It adds an optional 3x3 convolutional block before output to improve image quality.

The authors evaluate U-ViT on unconditional image generation, class-conditional image generation, and text-to-image generation. The results show U-ViT performs comparably or better than CNN-based U-Net backbones, suggesting the downsampling/upsampling operators in U-Net may not be necessary for diffusion models. 

With U-ViT, the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation on MS-COCO among methods without using large external datasets.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a simple yet effective ViT-based architecture for diffusion models that can match or exceed standard CNN-based models, while providing insights into diffusion model design.
