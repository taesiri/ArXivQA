# [Repetition Improves Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15449)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Autoregressive language models fail to encode bidirectional context in their embeddings - early token embeddings do not contain information about later tokens. This causes failures in estimating sentence similarity when sentences have similar beginnings but differ in meaning later on.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce "echo embeddings" where the input sentence is passed to the LM twice, and embeddings are extracted from the second occurrence. This allows later tokens to attend to the first occurrence, encoding bidirectional information.

- Specifically, a prompt like "Rewrite the sentence: [sent1], rewritten sentence: [sent1]" is passed to the LM and embeddings are extracted from [sent1] the second time.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate fundamental limitation of classical embeddings from autoregressive LMs 
- Propose echo embeddings to mitigate this failure mode and encode bidirectional context
- Show on synthetic and real data that echo embeddings fix the failure case of classical embeddings
- Evaluate echo embeddings on MTEB benchmark. Echo consistently outperforms classical embeddings both zero-shot and finetuned.
- Echo embeddings allow autoregressive LMs to achieve SOTA results on MTEB compared to prior Transformer models, without needing synthetic data.

The key insight is to repeat inputs to allow later tokens to attend to the first occurrence, encoding bidirectional information in the embeddings from the second occurrence. This simple but effective "echo embedding" strategy consistently improves over classical embeddings.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes "echo embeddings", a simple method of repeating the input text twice when encoding with an autoregressive language model to allow token embeddings to encode bidirectional context, demonstrating consistent improvements over classical embeddings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing "echo embeddings", a method to improve text embeddings extracted from autoregressive language models. Specifically:

- The paper identifies a key limitation of classical embeddings from autoregressive LMs - early token embeddings cannot encode information about later tokens due to the causal attention mask. This can lead to failures in estimating similarity when sentences have similar beginnings but diverge later.

- To address this, the paper proposes "echo embeddings" where the input text is passed to the LM twice. Embeddings are extracted from the second occurrence, allowing tokens to attend to the first occurrence and thus encode bidirectional information.

- Experiments show that echo embeddings outperform classical embeddings, both in zero-shot evaluations on MTEB by over 9% on average, and in fine-tuned settings where they achieve SOTA results compared to prior open-source models.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the echo embeddings method to allow embeddings from autoregressive LMs to encode bidirectional context, overcoming a key limitation and substantially improving performance. The simplicity and consistency of improvements across settings are also notable.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Echo embeddings - The main method proposed in the paper for improving embeddings from autoregressive language models by repeating the input text twice.

- Autoregressive language models - The type of language models that the paper focuses on for extracting embeddings, which have causal attention masking.

- Contextualized token embeddings - The vector representations of input tokens from the last layer of a language model. Echo embeddings aim to allow these to encode bidirectional context. 

- Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) - The benchmark used to evaluate different embedding techniques, including echo embeddings.

- Zero-shot embeddings - Embeddings extracted from a language model without any downstream fine-tuning, which the paper analyzes. 

- Finetuned embeddings - Embeddings extracted after fine-tuning the language model on a downstream task/dataset. Also evaluated in the paper.

- Mean token embeddings - A common pooling strategy that averages contextualized embeddings across tokens.

- Last-token embeddings - Another pooling strategy that uses the last token's embedding.

So in summary, the key terms revolve around techniques for extracting and improving embeddings from autoregressive language models, the proposed echo embeddings method, different training paradigms like zero-shot vs finetuning, pooling strategies, and the MTEB evaluation benchmark.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the echo embeddings method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that classical embeddings from autoregressive models fail to encode bidirectional context. However, in principle the embedding of the last token could encode information about the full context. Why does last-token pooling still perform much worse than echo embeddings in practice?

2. The paper demonstrates empirically that echo embeddings allow early tokens to encode information about later tokens. What modifications could be made to the attention mechanism of autoregressive models to achieve a similar effect without needing to repeat the input?

3. Echo embeddings improve performance even after finetuning the embeddings with a contrastive loss. Why does this gap persist even when the model has the capacity to learn an optimal embedding function? 

4. The paper hypothesizes two reasons why last-token classical embeddings underperform echo embeddings after finetuning. How would you design experiments to test these hypotheses about limitations of the intermediate representations?

5. The method feeds the input sentence twice into the model. How sensitive is performance to the exact choice of prompt used for the repetition, and could the prompts be optimized further? 

6. The compute cost for extracting echo embeddings is double that of classical embeddings. Does echo provide benefits in terms of sample efficiency or early stopping during fine-tuning to offset this?

7. The paper focuses on sentence-level embeddings. How does echo embeddings compare to classical for long-document embeddings where truncation may be required? Does echo provide greater benefits there?

8. What factors affect the generalizability of findings about echo on the MTEB benchmark to performance on downstream tasks? Could echo be substantially better or worse in certain domains?

9. The failure mode for classical embeddings identified by the authors relies on sentences having high superficial similarity followed by critical differences later on. Would you expect echo to help on datasets lacking this property? 

10. The method feeds the entire input twice into the model. Could the performance benefits of echo be achieved while reducing the sequence length by only repeating parts of the input most critical for the task?
