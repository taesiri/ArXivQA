# [Goal-Reaching Trajectory Design Near Danger with Piecewise Affine   Reach-avoid Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15604)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Autonomous robots need to be able to reach desired goal states while avoiding obstacles, known as the "reach-avoid" problem. This is particularly challenging when the goal state is very close to obstacles, termed the "near danger" case. Existing methods either introduce too much conservativeness that prevents reaching the goal, or do not provide safety guarantees.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a new method called Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) that enables computing trajectories that are guaranteed to reach the goal and avoid obstacles even in near danger scenarios. 

The key ideas are:
1) Use a simplified planning model to generate candidate trajectories, then track them using a high-fidelity robot model and controller. This avoids directly reasoning with complex robot dynamics.
2) Represent the planning model as a piecewise affine (PWA) system. This enables tightly approximating its reachable set, making the method less conservative. 
3) Incorporate tracking error between planning and robot models using sampled simulations to estimate maximum errors.
4) Compute a Backward Reach-Avoid Set (BRAS) that compactly represents initial states and parameters that generate goal-reaching, obstacle-avoiding trajectories.

Main Contributions:
1) An efficient, parallelizable method (PARC) to compute the BRAS for PWA planning models, enabling formal guarantees.
2) A scheme to incorporate tracking error estimates into PARC to transfer guarantees from planning model to actual robot.  
3) Demonstrated substantial improvements in reaching challenging goal states over state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments with a turtlebot, quadrotors, and an extreme vehicle drifting demo.

The method advances the state of the art in provably safe robot motion planning. Limitations include relying on accurate tracking error estimates and expensive computations that may hinder real-time performance. Overall, the paper makes excellent progress on the important challenge of reliably controlling robots in complex environments.
