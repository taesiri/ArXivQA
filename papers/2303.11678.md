# [Full or Weak annotations? An adaptive strategy for budget-constrained   annotation campaigns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11678)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is: 

Given a fixed annotation budget for a new segmentation dataset, what is the optimal proportion of the budget that should be allocated to full segmentation annotations versus weaker image-level classification annotations in order to maximize the performance of the trained segmentation model?

The key hypothesis is that there is a dataset-specific optimal proportion of segmentation vs classification annotations that maximizes segmentation performance under a fixed budget constraint. This optimal proportion is unknown a priori and depends on factors like the dataset domain, image characteristics, number of classes, etc. 

The paper proposes an adaptive online method to find this optimal annotation proportion by modeling the expected utility of different annotation allocations and sequentially determining the allocation that maximizes the expected improvement in the segmentation model.

In summary, the core research question is about optimally allocating a segmentation annotation budget between expensive pixel-level segmentations and cheaper image-level labels for a new dataset in order to maximize downstream segmentation performance. The key hypothesis is that there exists an optimal but unknown annotation proportion that is dataset-specific.
