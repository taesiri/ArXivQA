# [Full or Weak annotations? An adaptive strategy for budget-constrained   annotation campaigns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11678)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper aims to address is: 

Given a fixed annotation budget for a new segmentation dataset, what is the optimal proportion of the budget that should be allocated to full segmentation annotations versus weaker image-level classification annotations in order to maximize the performance of the trained segmentation model?

The key hypothesis is that there is a dataset-specific optimal proportion of segmentation vs classification annotations that maximizes segmentation performance under a fixed budget constraint. This optimal proportion is unknown a priori and depends on factors like the dataset domain, image characteristics, number of classes, etc. 

The paper proposes an adaptive online method to find this optimal annotation proportion by modeling the expected utility of different annotation allocations and sequentially determining the allocation that maximizes the expected improvement in the segmentation model.

In summary, the core research question is about optimally allocating a segmentation annotation budget between expensive pixel-level segmentations and cheaper image-level labels for a new dataset in order to maximize downstream segmentation performance. The key hypothesis is that there exists an optimal but unknown annotation proportion that is dataset-specific.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method to find an optimal budget allocation strategy for annotating datasets for semantic segmentation in an online manner. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- The paper focuses on the setting where annotations need to be gathered from scratch for a new segmentation task/dataset. It considers using a combination of expensive pixel-wise (strong) annotations and cheaper image-level class (weak) annotations. 

- It models the utility of different annotation strategies (combinations of strong/weak annotations) using a Gaussian Process (GP) and uses this to sequentially determine how to allocate portions of a total annotation budget.

- The main algorithm alternates between: (1) allocating a sub-budget and acquiring new annotations based on the current GP model; (2) training new segmentation models on the annotations so far to estimate performance; (3) updating the GP with these results to improve modeling of annotation strategies. 

- This allows dynamically determining a good annotation strategy tailored to the dataset, rather than using a fixed split of weak vs strong annotations.

- Experiments on 4 datasets show the proposed method is able to adaptively find strategies that achieve high segmentation performance across different budget sizes, close to the best fixed (but unknown) strategies.

In summary, the key contribution is an online method to sequentially determine an optimal annotation strategy for a new segmentation task/dataset by modeling the utility of different combinations of weak/strong annotations using a Gaussian Process.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from this paper:

The paper proposes a novel dynamic approach that determines the optimal proportion of full semantic segmentation and weaker image-level classification annotations to collect under a fixed budget to maximize segmentation model performance for a given dataset.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2023 paper submission compares to other related work in weakly supervised semantic segmentation:

- The key novelty of this paper is in dynamically determining the optimal proportion of weak (image-level) vs strong (pixel-level) annotations to collect under a fixed annotation budget. Most prior work in this area either assumes all annotations are available or uses a fixed split of weak/strong labels. The adaptive annotation strategy proposed here is novel.

- The work is similar in spirit to budget-aware active learning methods that aim to choose samples to annotate for maximizing performance under a budget. However, this paper focuses on selecting annotation types rather than samples. As the authors point out, the two approaches are largely orthogonal.

- Another related line of work optimizes the annotation strategy to reach a target performance level (e.g. Mahmood et al. ECCV'22, CVPR'22). In contrast, this paper aims to maximize performance for a given fixed budget, which is a subtly different but equally valid objective.

- For the weakly supervised segmentation model itself, the paper relies on a simple two-stage training approach, unlike more complex methods in recent weakly supervised segmentation literature. But the focus is not on the model architecture - any model could be plugged in.

- The Gaussian Process modeling to estimate utility is sound and aligns well with Bayesian optimization techniques for hyperparameter tuning. The iterative approximation scheme to deal with circular dependency is also reasonable.

So in summary, I feel the core ideas around adaptive annotation type selection are novel, while the underlying weakly supervised segmentation model and Gaussian Process utility modeling are relatively standard. The empirical validation on diverse datasets is quite thorough. Overall it advances the state-of-the-art in annotation strategy search for weakly supervised segmentation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring the use of higher-order priors in the Gaussian Process model to better handle cases where the performance does not scale logarithmically with dataset size (as seen in the SUIM dataset experiments). The authors suggest adaptive, non-parametric priors could help deal with such cases.

- Combining the proposed approach with active learning methods. The authors state their method is orthogonal to active learning, which focuses on selecting optimal samples to annotate. Combining both could potentially further improve performance and annotation efficiency.

- Generalizing the formulation to support more than two annotation types. The current method focuses on segmentation and classification, but could be extended to other annotation modalities like bounding boxes, keypoints, etc.

- Exploring alternative training strategies and loss functions for the weakly supervised segmentation model. The authors use a simple strategy of training on classification then fine-tuning on segmentation, but other approaches could be integrated into their framework as well.

- Reducing the computational load of repeatedly training models, especially as dataset size increases over iterations. The authors suggest using faster surrogate models, but other approaches like incremental training could also help.

- Validating the approach on a wider range of datasets and application domains beyond the four used in the paper.

- Comparing against other related methods like the budget-aware annotation strategies proposed by Mahmood et al.

Overall, the paper provides a solid foundation and proof of concept for adaptively determining annotation strategies. But there are many promising avenues, as outlined above, for extending and improving the approach further.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for determining an optimal annotation strategy when building a segmentation dataset under a fixed budget constraint. The key idea is to iteratively alternate between allocating parts of the budget, acquiring new annotations, and training segmentation models to estimate the performance for different annotation proportions. At each step, a Gaussian Process is fitted to model the expected utility of different annotation allocations and find the next best proportion to maximize improvement. Experiments on four datasets show the method adapts well across domains and budgets, achieving near optimal performance, whereas fixed strategies consistently underperform. The approach helps automate building annotated segmentation datasets by automatically determining annotation allocations likely to yield good subsequent segmentation models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new method for adaptively determining the optimal annotation strategy when building a segmentation dataset under a fixed budget constraint. The key idea is to alternate between allocating parts of the budget, acquiring new labels, and training models to estimate the utility of different annotation proportions. At each step, the method trains multiple models using the current labeled data to predict how varying ratios of weak image-level labels and strong segmentation masks impact model performance. These results are used to fit a Gaussian Process (GP) that models the expected segmentation improvement as a function of weak and strong annotations. Using the GP, the approach computes the Pareto optimal allocation for the next partial budget that maximizes expected improvement in segmentation performance. By repeating this process, the method sequentially determines an efficient annotation strategy tailored to the dataset. 

Experiments on datasets from different domains validate the approach. Compared to fixed annotation ratios, the adaptive strategy achieves strong performance across varying budget sizes and datasets. The results illustrate that fixed allocation strategies tend to work well only for specific budgets and datasets. In contrast, the proposed method adapts the annotation ratio as the budget grows, leading to robust performance. While not guaranteed to find the optimal strategy, it comes close and on average outperforms alternatives. The approach does fail on one dataset where the core GP assumption is violated, motivating extensions with more flexible utility models. Overall, the method offers an effective data-driven solution for allocating annotation budgets when collecting segmentation datasets.
