# [Enforcing Temporal Constraints on Generative Agent Behavior with   Reactive Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16905)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are limited in their ability to maintain coherent and consistent behavior over long conversations. When used to control agents like video game NPCs, they can display temporal inconsistency.
- Prompt engineering is challenging and doesn't provide guarantees on agent behavior. There are "gulfs of execution and evaluation" between user intentions and LLM outputs.

Proposed Solution:
- Combine logic-based program synthesis using Temporal Stream Logic (TSL) with LLM content generation
- TSL allows imposing temporal constraints on LLM behavior and synthesizes a state machine mediator
- LLM generates content conditioned on state machine prompts
- Provides adherence, interpretability and modularity compared to pure LLM agents

Key Contributions:
1) A formal model of generative agents and metrics of adherence, interpretability and modularity
2) A system combining TSL and LLMs where TSL manages temporal constraints and LLMs generate point-in-time content 
3) An evaluation on a "choose your own adventure" game showing much higher adherence and lower errors compared to a pure LLM agent

The system bridges the gaps between user intentions and LLM outputs by making agent behavior interpretable and constrained by formal specifications. The modular approach also makes iterative improvement easier compared to opaque prompt engineering.
