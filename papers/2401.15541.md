# [Stitching Satellites to the Edge: Pervasive and Efficient Federated LEO   Satellite Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15541)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Integrating federated learning (FL) with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for edge computing faces significant challenges such as limited and intermittent connectivity, constrained on-board computing capabilities, and high energy consumption. These limitations make it difficult to train large machine learning models collaboratively across LEO satellites.

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a two-fold solution:

1. Personalized Learning via Divide-and-Conquer: This scheme identifies and eliminates redundant satellite images on each satellite, converting the multi-class classification problem into multiple simple binary classifiers. This approach enables rapid training of lightweight models suitable for resource-constrained LEO satellites.

2. Orbital Model Retraining: A designated "sink" satellite in each orbit aggregates trained binary classifiers from all satellites in that orbit into a multi-class "orbital model". This model is iteratively retrained for multiple rounds among the satellites before being transmitted to the ground station. This minimizes waiting time and reduces communication rounds.

Main Contributions:

- Demonstrates the feasibility of running lightweight ML models on real satellite imagery data with constrained on-board computing
- Achieves remarkably fast convergence, reducing communication rounds from tens to only 2-3 
- Significantly reduces energy consumption down to 1.38 Watts per satellite
- Evaluations using real satellite dataset and edge device show high accuracy (95.78%) with low computation (11 GFLOPs) and communication (0.437 MB) overheads

Overall, the paper presents a practical FL framework tailored for LEO satellites that enables collaborative on-board training with minimal resource usage. The personalized learning and orbital retraining schemes lead to highly efficient learning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a federated learning framework tailored for low Earth orbit satellite edge computing that enables efficient onboard machine learning through personalized learning via divide-and-conquer and accelerated convergence via orbital model retraining.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a personalized learning via divide-and-conquer (DnC) approach that identifies and eliminates redundant satellite images to reduce data volume and converts complex multi-class classification problems into simple binary classification. This enables rapid and energy-efficient training of lightweight ML models suitable for resource-constrained satellites.

2) It introduces an orbital model retraining scheme where a designated "sink" satellite in each orbit aggregates models from all satellites in that orbit into an "orbital model" and retrains it for multiple epochs before sending it to the ground station. This significantly reduces the number of communication rounds required for federated learning convergence.

3) Through experiments on a real satellite dataset using an edge device, the paper shows the proposed approach achieves much faster federated learning convergence (within 2 hours) compared to prior art while maintaining high accuracy. It also reduces computation/communication overhead and satellite energy consumption down to very low levels, making it suitable for satellite edge computing scenarios.

In summary, the key innovation is an efficient and pragmatic federated learning framework tailored for resource-constrained satellites that enables rapid onboard model training and convergence across multiple orbits.
