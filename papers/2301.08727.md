## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a neural architecture search method based on differentiable architecture search. The key idea is to relax the discrete architecture search space to be continuous, allowing gradient-based optimization of the architecture. Specifically, the method represents the architecture as a directed acyclic graph, with each edge associated with a set of possible operations (such as convolution or pooling). During training, each edge is associated with a mixing of all possible operations via a continuous relaxation, where each operation is weighted by an architecture parameter. The architecture is trained end-to-end with the model weights by alternating between optimizing the model weights (with one step of gradient descent) and optimizing the architecture parameters (with one step of gradient descent on the validation loss). After training finishes, the final architecture is derived by discretizing the mixing weights, selecting the single operation with the maximum weight on each edge. This final architecture is then trained from scratch. Overall, this approach allows efficient search by avoiding training each candidate architecture separately.
