# [Smartphone region-wise image indoor localization using deep learning for   indoor tourist attraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07621)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Indoor localization using GPS signals is challenging in places like museums/aquariums due to materials like concrete/metal that weaken signals. Alternative solutions like WiFi/Bluetooth require infrastructure investment. 
- The Pantanal Biopark freshwater aquarium in Brazil wants to create a smartphone app to automatically identify which thematic fish tank a visitor is looking at to enhance the visitor's educational experience.

Proposed Solution:
- Use image classification to match smartphone camera images to specific fish tanks, then match the identified tank to the known location of that tank on the Biopark's map for localization.
- Collect a dataset of 3654 images across 24 thematic tanks in the Biopark using 10 different smartphone models.
- Evaluate 7 state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification on this dataset.

Main Contributions:
- Novel image dataset with 3654 images from 24 thematic fish tanks in the Pantanal Biopark aquarium.
- Evaluation of deep learning models for fish tank classification, focused on small models feasible for mobile devices.
- Analysis of using deep learning for smartphone image-based indoor localization without infrastructure investment, with average precision/recall/F1 scores around 88-90\% achieved.

The authors propose an infrastructure-free indoor localization system for the Pantanal Biopark by matching smartphone images of thematic tanks to tank locations. They create a new challenging fish tank image dataset and evaluate deep learning models, demonstrating good feasibility of their proposed approach.
