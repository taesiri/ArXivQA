# [MLP Can Be A Good Transformer Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05657)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers like ViT achieve strong performance but their self-attention mechanism requires high computation and memory costs which limits their scalability.
- Existing methods like token pruning and aggregation reduce computation but still load the full network and have the same memory costs.  

Solution:
- Propose to directly remove uninformative attention layers to reduce both computation and memory.
- Identify non-essential attention layers based on entropy and transfer entropy measures. Attention layers with low entropy and minimal transfer entropy impact on the output are selected.
- Gradually degenerate selected attention layers into an identical mapping using a dilution learning technique.
- The identical mapping integrates with the subsequent MLP layer, yielding only MLP blocks and removing the attention computation.

Contributions:  
- Propose an entropy-based selection strategy (NOSE) to identify attention layers with minimum impact on network output to remove. Uses transfer entropy to approximate interaction of layers.
- Introduce a simple network dilution method to gradually transform low entropy attention layers into an identical mapping to be merged with subsequent MLP.  
- Demonstrate removal of 40% of attention layers in DeiT-B without performance drop. Reduces params by 13.7% and improves throughput 20.5%.
- Outperforms comparison token pruning methods on ImageNet, CIFAR and ADE20K. Transferred representations also show better generalization ability.

In summary, the paper provides a way to simplify vision transformers by pruning attention layers based on entropy measures to reduce computation and memory with minimal impact on accuracy. The dilution learning technique integrates pruned layers with MLPs yielding further efficiency gains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework that selectively removes non-essential attention layers from vision transformers, guided by entropy considerations, and integrates them into subsequent MLP layers through a dilution learning technique, yielding MLP-only blocks and reducing parameters and memory requirements without compromising performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a novel framework that transplants the knowledge of non-essential attention layers into their subsequent MLP layers in vision transformers. 

2. They propose an entropy-based selection strategy (NOSE) to identify the combination of attention layers that has the least influence on the model outputs. This strategy considers the interaction between layers based on transfer entropy.

3. They introduce a simple yet effective dilution learning technique that gradually degenerates selected attention layers into identical mapping layers. This allows integrating the attention layers into the subsequent MLPs, yielding only MLPs in certain transformer blocks.

In summary, the key contribution is simplifying vision transformers by selectively removing non-essential attention layers guided by entropy considerations, which can reduce parameters and compute while maintaining accuracy. The proposed techniques for selection and integration of attention layers are also novel.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. Why did the authors use entropy as the metric to measure the information carried by different layers in the vision transformer? What are the advantages of using entropy over other metrics?

2. The paper proposed NOSE strategy to identify the optimal combination of attention layers to remove. How does NOSE capture the interaction between multiple layers? Why is considering interaction important in layer removal?  

3. The paper gradually degenerates the selected attention layers into identical mapping. What is the motivation behind this "network dilution" approach? How does it help integrate attention layers into the MLP layers?

4. What is the key idea behind the proposed feature compensation technique? How does it help stabilize the training when removing attention layers?

5. The experiments show that removing 40% attention layers does not degrade performance on ImageNet. What properties of the learned features contribute to this result? How does the paper analyze the feature expressivity?

6. How does the removal of attention layers help improve throughput and memory bound? What are the differences compared to token pruning methods?

7. Why does the paper evaluate on segmentation and transfer learning tasks? What do the additional experiments on different tasks show about the method?

8. Could the method be applied to natural language processing transformers? What adaptations would be needed to make it work for NLP models?

9. The paper shows compatibility experiments transplanting original transformer blocks into the simplified model. What does this analysis reveal about the learned features?

10. What are potential limitations of the approach? In what scenarios might the performance degradation become more severe when removing attention layers?
