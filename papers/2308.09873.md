# [Skill Transformer: A Monolithic Policy for Mobile Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09873)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop an end-to-end trainable policy that can perform long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks requiring both high-level reasoning/planning and low-level motor control?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By combining conditional sequence modeling with a module that explicitly predicts skills, it is possible to learn a monolithic policy that retains the benefits of skill modularity while avoiding issues like hand-off errors between separate skills.

In particular, the paper proposes "Skill Transformer", an end-to-end trainable transformer-based policy architecture that contains both a "Skill Inference" module for high-level reasoning about which skill to execute, and an "Action Inference" module for low-level control conditioned on the predicted skill. The goal is to develop a policy that can sequence multiple distinct skills to accomplish long-horizon tasks like object rearrangement in novel environments.

So in summary, the main research question is how to develop an end-to-end policy for long-horizon multi-skill tasks, and the key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling skills within a monolithic policy can combine the benefits of skill modularity and end-to-end training. The Skill Transformer architecture embodies this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing the Skill Transformer (ST) method, which is an end-to-end trainable transformer policy for multi-skill mobile manipulation tasks like object rearrangement. The key ideas of ST seem to be:

- Combining high-level skill selection and low-level action prediction in a single transformer-based policy architecture. This avoids having separate modular components for skills and sequencing.

- The policy consists of two main modules: a Skill Inference module that predicts which skill should be executed at each time step, and an Action Inference module that outputs low-level actions conditioned on the predicted skill. 

- Training the policy end-to-end using demonstrations that solve the full task. This allows learning long-horizon tasks composed of multiple skills in an integrated fashion, overcoming limitations of modular approaches.

- Achieving strong performance on a challenging "rearrange-hard" benchmark that requires variable-length planning and handling perturbations, outperforming various baseline methods including modular hierarchical approaches and end-to-end reinforcement learning.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be presenting a new monolithic policy architecture and training approach that can learn multiple skills and robustly sequence them together for complex mobile manipulation tasks, while retaining modularity through the high-level skill prediction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, here are some key ways this paper compares to related work in mobile robotics and manipulation:

- This paper presents a method called Skill Transformer for mobile manipulation tasks like rearrangement. It combines end-to-end learning with some modularity through skill prediction. This differs from prior work that either learns completely end-to-end policies or relies on modular pipelines.

- Compared to modular approaches, Skill Transformer can adapt its plan online based on observations rather than following a fixed plan. This makes it more robust, as shown in the perturbation experiments. However, modular approaches may still be more interpretable and controllable.

- Unlike some end-to-end reinforcement learning methods, Skill Transformer is trained via imitation learning on human demonstrations. This allows it to solve longer horizon tasks that RL struggles with. The transformer architecture also helps it scale and generalize better than LSTMs.

- Relative to prior imitation learning work, Skill Transformer incorporates the auxiliary skill prediction loss during training. This improves the learning of distinct skills compared to methods like Decision Transformer.

- For mobile manipulation specifically, Skill Transformer demonstrates better generalization and more consistent performance on intricate mobile skills compared to behavioral cloning of modular skills. This highlights the benefits of end-to-end learning.

- Skill Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex rearrangement tasks in the Habitat platform. It also shows stronger resilience to perturbations compared to alternatives.

In summary, Skill Transformer aims to combine the strengths of end-to-end and modular approaches for mobile manipulation. The results demonstrate improved generalization, robustness and scalability over prior methods on challenging embodied AI tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring how Skill Transformer can incorporate more complex task specifications, such as images of the desired end state or natural language instructions. The current geometric task specification makes it difficult to identify the target object after its container is manipulated. 

- Training Skill Transformer with reinforcement learning (RL) in addition to imitation learning. The current work trains the model solely through imitation learning on expert demonstrations. Using RL could help improve the policy.

- Evaluating Skill Transformer on more complex and diverse rearrangement tasks, with more objects to manipulate and longer planning horizons. This could better demonstrate the approach's capabilities.

- Extending Skill Transformer to work in real-world settings, on a physical robot. The current work is simulation-based. Deploying it in the real world poses additional challenges.

- Incorporating hierarchical policies and temporal abstractions within the Skill Transformer architecture. This could allow planning and reasoning over longer time horizons.

- Combining Skill Transformer with exploration and memory-based architectures to handle more partially observable environments. The current architecture has limited memory over past observations.

- Investigating different conditional skill modeling approaches beyond the current transformer-based architecture. There may be other effective ways to model skills and skill transitions.

Overall, the authors suggest directions to scale up Skill Transformer to more complex tasks, deploy it on real robots, integrate hierarchical planning and memory, and explore alternative architectural designs - to further demonstrate and improve its capabilities for long-horizon mobile manipulation problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Skill Transformer, an end-to-end trainable transformer-based policy for long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks that require sequencing multiple skills. The policy consists of a Skill Encoder module that predicts a high-level skill conditioned on past observations, and an Action Inference module that outputs low-level robot actions conditioned on the predicted skill and observations. Together, these allow Skill Transformer to reason about both which skills to perform and how to execute them from raw egocentric observations. Skill Transformer is trained via supervised learning on demonstration data that performs the full task. Experiments in object rearrangement tasks in the Habitat simulator show that Skill Transformer can successfully compose skills and adapt to perturbations better than modular baselines and end-to-end RL. The method achieves higher success rates, especially in challenging situations where objects may start in closed receptacles. Ablations validate the design choices and show the approach scales well with more training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents Skill Transformer, an end-to-end trainable transformer-based policy for long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks like object rearrangement. The key idea is to combine conditional sequence modeling with a skill prediction module to retain the composability and modularity of multi-phase tasks while avoiding issues like hand-off errors in modular approaches. Specifically, the Skill Transformer consists of two main components: a Skill Inference module implemented as a causal transformer that predicts the active high-level skill at each time step, and an Action Inference module implemented as a transformer that predicts low-level actions conditioned on the inferred skill, past observations, and actions. 

The Skill Transformer is trained via imitation learning on expert demonstrations that solve the full rearrangement task. Experiments in a challenging object rearrangement benchmark show it can perform robust task planning and control in novel scenarios, achieving much higher success rates than modular baselines as well as end-to-end baselines like Decision Transformer. Ablations validate key design decisions like the transformer backbone and skill prediction module. Overall, by combining long-horizon sequence modeling with skill-based conditioning in an end-to-end framework, Skill Transformer provides an effective approach for learning complex, multi-phase tasks from limited demonstrations.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper describes the Skill Transformer, an end-to-end trainable transformer policy for solving long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. The key ideas are:

- The policy is composed of two modules. A Skill Inference module uses a causal transformer to predict the high-level skill to execute at each time step conditioned on past observations. An Action Inference module then predicts the low-level action to take conditioned on the predicted skill and past observations. 

- The policy is trained via imitation learning on demonstrations of the full task created by composing individual skills with an oracle planner. This allows it to learn the skill selections and transitions, as well as the low-level actions, in an end-to-end fashion.

- The Skill Transformer retains the composability and modularity of skills through the skill prediction module while avoiding hand-off errors common in modular approaches. It can adapt its plan based on observations without needing a fixed high-level plan.

- Experiments on an object rearrangement benchmark show the Skill Transformer performs robust long-term planning and control. It outperforms modular baselines by adapting its plan when perturbations occur and achieves higher success rates than end-to-end baselines by effectively composing multiple skills.
