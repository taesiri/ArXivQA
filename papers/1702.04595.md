# [Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions: Prediction Difference   Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04595)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop an interpretable visualization method to explain the classification decisions made by deep neural networks? 

The authors propose a new method called "prediction difference analysis" to generate visual explanations for DNN classifications. The key ideas are:

- Estimate the relevance of an input feature by measuring how the prediction changes when that feature is unknown/removed.

- Use conditional sampling to simulate absent features in a more accurate way compared to marginal sampling. 

- Remove multiple features at once (patches of pixels) for a multivariate analysis.

- Extend the analysis to visualize evidence for/against hidden units to understand internal network representations.

The authors then demonstrate their method on ImageNet data classified by convolutional neural nets, as well as on MRI brain scans classified for neurodegenerative disease. Their main hypothesis seems to be that the proposed prediction difference analysis will produce more insightful and interpretable visualizations of DNN decisions compared to previous approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new method for visualizing and explaining the decisions made by deep neural networks. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Introducing the prediction difference analysis method, which highlights areas in the input that provide evidence for or against a certain class by estimating how the prediction changes when parts of the input are unknown.

- Improving this method with conditional sampling, which gives a better approximation of the effect of removing input features by conditioning on surrounding context. 

- Using a multivariate approach by removing patches of pixels instead of single pixels, which better reflects how neural networks operate.

- Extending the method to also visualize the role of hidden layers in a neural network, not just the input-output relation.

In summary, the main contribution is a new visualization technique that produces saliency maps highlighting the importance of different parts of the input for a neural network's decision. This helps improve interpretability and transparency of deep neural networks. The method is demonstrated on ImageNet data using convolutional neural nets, as well as on MRI brain scans for disease classification.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new method called prediction difference analysis for visualizing and understanding how deep neural networks make decisions on image classification tasks by highlighting which parts of a given input image provide evidence for or against a particular classification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of visualizing and interpreting deep neural network decisions:

- The prediction difference analysis method proposed in this paper builds directly on previous work by Robnik-Å ikonja and Kononenko on explaining classifier decisions. The key novelties are the use of conditional sampling rather than marginal sampling, the multivariate patch-based approach rather than univariate, and extending the method to visualize hidden layers of deep neural networks.

- Compared to other common methods like class saliency maps and gradient-based sensitivity analysis, the prediction difference approach provides signed evidence (positive or negative support) rather than just a measure of feature importance. This gives additional insight into the decision process.

- Visualizing activations and feature maps of hidden layers to understand their functionality, as done in this paper, is a fairly standard analysis technique for neural networks. However, combining this with the prediction difference method provides a more rigorous way to quantify the influence of hidden units on later layers.

- For ImageNet classifiers, this paper demonstrates the technique on standard network architectures like AlexNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet. The comparisons between models provide some interesting insights into their decision processes, but no major new discoveries.

- The application to analyzing medical image classifiers is novel and impactful. Visual explanations for MRI-based models could improve trust and interpretability for clinical usage. The paper only scratches the surface of this application but shows promising results.

- Overall, this paper makes several solid contributions by improving on an existing decision explanation method and demonstrating how it can provide deeper understanding of modern deep neural networks, both for natural images and medical images. The techniques seem quite general and likely transferrable to other data modalities as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Using more sophisticated generative models for conditional sampling to further improve the visualization results. The authors mention that using more powerful models to generate the pixel samples conditioned on the surrounding pixels could lead to better explanations, but would also increase computational requirements.

- Modifying the conditional sampling approximation (equation 4) to take even more global image information into account, such as spatial location for MRI scans. This could provide an even better approximation for the conditional distributions.

- Testing the method on better classification algorithms for the medical imaging examples, to generate explanations that are closer to the true class differences. The authors state that with clinical applications, it's important to have very accurate classifiers so the explanations match the true underlying causes.

- Developing interactive 3D visualization software for clinical analysis and practice with the MRI data. The authors suggest a 3D animation where parameters like slicing and patch size could be adjusted would be very useful for analyzing the results in medical settings.

- Further optimizing and implementing the method on GPUs to significantly reduce pre-computation time for real-time usage. The authors acknowledge the high computational demands but suggest optimization could enable real-time performance.

In summary, the main suggested future work is on improving the conditional sampling models, optimizing the computations, testing on better classifiers, developing specialized software for medical imaging, and modifying the approximations to incorporate more global context. The overall goal is improving explanations and reducing computation time.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new method called prediction difference analysis for visualizing and explaining the decisions made by deep neural networks when classifying images. The method produces a saliency map that highlights the parts (features) of a given input image that provide the most evidence for or against a certain class predicted by the network. It improves on previous methods by using conditional sampling to better estimate the evidence for a class when a feature is unknown, analyzing multiple features jointly in a multivariate fashion, and extending the analysis to hidden layers of a deep neural network. The method is demonstrated on ImageNet data using deep convolutional neural networks as well as MRI brain scans classified using logistic regression. It provides insight into how the networks make decisions and shows promise for accelerating the adoption of deep learning in domains like healthcare where explaining decisions is crucial.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new method called prediction difference analysis for visualizing and understanding how deep neural networks make decisions when classifying images. The key idea is to measure how the predicted probability for a class changes when parts of the input image are masked. This highlights which parts of the image provide evidence for or against that class. 

The authors propose several improvements over previous approaches. They use conditional sampling to mask image patches in a probabilistically sound way, analyze multiple features jointly, and extend the method to visualize evidence for activations in hidden layers. Experiments on ImageNet show how the method provides insights into neural networks like AlexNet and GoogLeNet. It is also applied to MRI brain scans to explain decisions in medical imaging. The visualization helps identify discriminative patterns between classes and could lead to more transparency in using black-box classifiers like deep networks.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a new visualization method called prediction difference analysis for explaining the decisions made by deep neural networks (DNNs). The key idea is to measure how the prediction probability of a DNN classifier changes when parts of the input are masked or removed. To do this, they sample masked versions of the input image by replacing patches of pixels with samples conditional on the surrounding pixels. By measuring the change in prediction probability when patches are removed, they can quantify the evidence for or against a classification provided by each part of the input image. The method can visualize decisions at any layer of a DNN by propagating inputs forward and measuring changes in activations. The paper demonstrates the technique on ImageNet data using deep convolutional neural networks and on MRI brain scans classified by logistic regression. The main improvements over prior work are the use of a conditional multivariate distribution over patches and application to visualizing DNN hidden layers and decisions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is presenting a new method for explaining and visualizing the decisions made by deep neural networks. The main problem it is trying to address is the lack of interpretability and transparency in deep neural networks. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a "prediction difference analysis" method that highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class predicted by the network. This allows better understanding of why the network makes a particular classification decision on a specific input.

Some key aspects:

- Current methods for visualizing deep nets have limitations. They focus on finding inputs that maximize activations, not explaining decisions on specific inputs. Other methods like saliency maps are not as rigorous. 

- The proposed method estimates feature importance by measuring how the prediction score changes when a feature is missing or unknown. This is done in a probabilistic way by marginalizing or conditioning on features.

- The approach is extended to handle multivariate interactions between groups of features like image patches, not just individual features.

- The method can visualize evidence for/against classes at any layer in the network, not just the output.

- Experiments on ImageNet and MRI data demonstrate how the technique provides interpretable visual explanations and insights into network decisions.

So in summary, the key problem is lack of interpretability of deep net classifiers, and this paper presents a new principled approach for input-specific visual explanations of model decisions to address this limitation.
