# [LLM4Vuln: A Unified Evaluation Framework for Decoupling and Enhancing   LLMs' Vulnerability Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16185)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for vulnerability detection. However, existing attempts lack sufficient understanding of LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capabilities - whether it comes from the models themselves or from leveraging other capabilities like tool support and knowledge retrieval. There is a need to decouple and enhance different capabilities of LLMs for more effective vulnerability reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LLM4Vuln, a unified evaluation framework to decouple and enhance LLMs' vulnerability reasoning. The framework has four main components:

1) Knowledge Retrieval: Provides a searchable vector database of vulnerability knowledge to enhance LLMs' knowledge. Both raw vulnerability reports and summarized knowledge are added.  

2) Tool Invocation: Allows LLMs to actively seek additional context for the code via function calls to program analysis tools.

3) Prompt Schemes: Explores raw prompts and two chain-of-thought (CoT) prompt schemes to provide better instructions.

4) Instruction Following: Uses GPT-4's superior instruction following to structure and align the output of less capable models to enable automatic evaluation.

The framework is implemented for 75 real smart contract vulnerabilities and tested on GPT-4, Mixtral and CodeLlama in 4,950 scenarios.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the first framework to decouple and enhance different LLM capabilities for detecting vulnerabilities

- Provides the ability to invoke tools via function calls to augment LLMs' context

- Explores raw vs. CoT prompt schemes for better instruction following

- Empirically evaluates combinations of capabilities on 75 real smart contract vulnerabilities

- Discovers 10 findings regarding knowledge formats, context impacts, prompt schemes and model differences  

- Identifies 9 zero-day vulnerabilities in two bug bounty programs

In summary, the paper introduces a novel evaluation framework to gain key insights into decoupling and improving LLMs' automated vulnerability reasoning through targeted capability enhancement.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a unified evaluation framework called LLM4Vuln to decouple and enhance large language models' reasoning capability in vulnerability detection by incorporating knowledge enhancement, tool invocation, prompt engineering, and instruction following.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a unified evaluation framework called LLM4Vuln to decouple and enhance large language models' (LLMs) reasoning capability specifically for vulnerability detection. The key aspects of the framework include:

1) Enabling knowledge enhancement for LLMs by building vector databases to retrieve relevant vulnerability knowledge, including both raw vulnerability reports and summarized knowledge. This allows benchmarking the impact of different forms of knowledge supplementation.

2) Providing context supplementation by letting LLMs invoke tools to retrieve additional information about the target code via function calling. This evaluates how extra context aids reasoning. 

3) Designing prompt schemes, like chain-of-thought prompts, to give LLMs enhanced instructions to improve reasoning.

4) Using well-instructed models to refine and structure the output of less-instructed models to enable automatic evaluation.

The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this framework through extensive experiments using real-world smart contract vulnerabilities. The results provide insights about knowledge and context supplements, prompt schemes, model differences, etc. in influencing LLMs' vulnerability reasoning capability. Additionally, the framework helped discover 9 zero-day vulnerabilities in pilot testing.

In summary, the core contribution is proposing and empirically evaluating LLM4Vuln, a modular framework to decouple and enhance LLMs' vulnerability reasoning by controlling for and combining their diverse capabilities.

The paper proposes a framework called LLM4Vuln to evaluate and enhance the capability of LLMs to reason about vulnerabilities. It focuses on decoupling the vulnerability reasoning capability of LLMs from their other capabilities like seeking additional information or adopting relevant knowledge. The framework incorporates vector databases for knowledge retrieval, supplements context through tool invocation, explores prompt engineering methods, and uses instruction following to structure the output. Experiments are conducted using real-world smart contract vulnerabilities to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Key findings relate to the impacts of different knowledge forms, context information, prompt schemes, and model choices on the quality of an LLM's vulnerability detection.
