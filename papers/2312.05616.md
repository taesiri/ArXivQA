# [Iterative Token Evaluation and Refinement for Real-World   Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Real-world image super-resolution (RWSR) is challenging as low-quality (LQ) images often contain complex and unknown distortions that degrade image details. Existing methods have limitations: GAN-based methods are difficult to train and generate realistic textures; diffusion model (DM) based methods require numerous sampling steps.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an Iterative Token Evaluation and Refinement (ITER) framework for RWSR. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate RWSR in discrete token space of a VQGAN instead of pixel space. This reduces ambiguity and enables efficient sampling. 

2) Explicitly separate RWSR into distortion removal and texture generation modules. Distortion removal predicts HQ tokens from LQ image. Texture generation uses a conditioned discrete diffusion model to iteratively refine the predicted tokens.

3) Introduce a token evaluation block in the diffusion process to decide which tokens to refine at each step. This avoids "local trap" issue in prior arts and improves refinement.  

4) Enable adaptive inference by evaluating initially predicted tokens. Based on quality, adaptively select refinement steps to balance distortion removal and texture generation.

Main Contributions:

- Propose ITER, an iterative token evaluation and refinement framework for RWSR utilizing discrete diffusion models. Demonstrate state-of-the-art results with less than 8 steps.

- Formulate RWSR explicitly with separate distortion removal and texture generation modules in discrete token space. Enables specialized optimization.

- Introduce token evaluation block to avoid local trap and enable adaptive inference during diffusion process. Permits flexible control over texture strength.

- Analyze and compare ITER against GAN and continuous diffusion models. Show advantages in training, inference efficiency and generalization.
