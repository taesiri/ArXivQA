# [Guided Demonstrations Using Automated Excuse Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18355)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes the use of "excuses" to provide targeted guidance for human demonstrations to a robot trying to learn new skills. An excuse is defined as the minimal change needed in the robot's current state to make an previously unsolvable task solvable. By generating such excuses automatically and conveying them to the human demonstrator, the robot can solicit more concise and relevant demonstrations that specifically address the missing capabilities, without needing demonstrations of the entire task. Through a user study in a virtual reality setting, the authors empirically validate that excuse-guided demonstrations lead to a 54% reduction in demonstration time and a 74% decrease in demonstration length compared to unguided demonstrations. Additional analysis shows the excuse-based guidance enables the robot to successfully solve the overall task after learning from the abbreviated demonstration. While there are some open caveats regarding excuse redundancy and selection among multiple excuses, the paper makes a compelling case for excuses as an interpretable form of feedback to improve the efficiency of learning from demonstration systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using automatically generated "excuses" - minimal changes to the robot's state that make an unsolvable task solvable - to guide and reduce the size of human demonstrations for teaching robots new skills.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

1) The formalization of the guided demonstration task with excuses as the mode of guidance.

2) A user study that shows how guided demonstrations can significantly reduce the time and demonstrated size, improving the effectiveness of how learning from demonstration (LfD) methods can be applied to expand the robot's capabilities to interact with its environment.

In particular, the user study found that using excuses for guidance reduced the demonstration time by 54% and led to a 74% reduction in demonstration size compared to unguided demonstrations of the full task. This supports the effectiveness of excuses in reducing the burden on human demonstrators in LfD scenarios.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Learning from demonstrations (LfD)
- Unsolvable planning tasks
- Excuses - changes to the initial state that make an unsolvable task solvable
- Guided demonstrations - using excuses to guide what parts of a task need to be demonstrated
- Demonstration efficiency - measures like demonstration size/length, time taken, usefulness
- Domain artifacts - symbolic representations of skills and actions the robot knows
- Task planning - planning sequences of actions to achieve multi-step goals
- Embodiment mapping - mapping human demonstrations to executable robot actions
- Combinatorial search - searching through possible model changes to find excuses
- Virtual reality - using VR to collect demonstrations

The main focus seems to be on using "excuses" to provide targeted guidance on what needs to be demonstrated to a robot when facing unsolvable planning tasks, in order to improve the efficiency and reduce the burden of providing demonstrations. Concepts like learning from demonstration, task planning, excuses, and guided demonstrations seem most central.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors propose using "excuses" to provide guidance to human demonstrators on what needs to be demonstrated. How is the concept of an "excuse" formally defined in this paper? What key properties must an excuse satisfy?

2. The excuse generation algorithm utilizes combinatorial search over possible state changes to find a minimal set of changes that make the task solvable. Can you explain in detail how this search process works? What objective function is being optimized?  

3. The authors evaluate excuse-guided demonstrations along several quantitative metrics like demonstration time, size reduction, plan solvability etc. Can you summarize the key metrics proposed and how each of them captures a unique aspect of performance?

4. Proposition 1 in the paper provides a theoretical guarantee that guided demonstrations will always be smaller in size compared to unguided ones. Explain this result and discuss if you expect it to always hold true in practice when human demonstrators are involved.

5. The embodiment mapping function plays a key role in mapping human activities to executable robot actions. However, details of this mapping are not provided. Propose two different approaches for realizing this mapping and discuss their tradeoffs.  

6. The excuse generation process relies on the robot having some prior domain knowledge about its own capabilities. Discuss how errors or incompleteness in this prior knowledge can impact the quality and usefulness of the generated excuses.

7. The authors identify "misdirected guidance" as a potential failure mode for excuse-based demonstrations. Provide 1-2 examples to illustrate this concept and propose ways to safeguard against such failures.

8. Explain why the choice of excuse can significantly impact the eventual size of the guided demonstration, even when multiple minimal excuses exist. How can this redundancy be exploited?

9. The paper assumes that the human demonstrator is cooperative and capable of properly interpreting and demonstrating the requested excuse. In practice, many errors are possible. Propose 2-3 error handling strategies.

10. The evaluation relies on virtual reality demonstrations. Discuss challenges and opportunities involved in translating this approach to real-world robotic systems where perception and embodiment differences exist.
