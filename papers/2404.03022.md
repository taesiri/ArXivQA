# [BCAmirs at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Beyond Words: A Multimodal and   Multilingual Exploration of Persuasion in Memes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Memes often use persuasive techniques to shape public opinion, motivating the need to detect psychological and rhetorical tactics in memes, especially for disinformation campaigns.  
- Current multimodal models do not effectively capture the metaphorical meaning in images, leading to a gap between visual and textual understanding. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a meme captioning step using GPT-4 and LLaVA to assess the modality gap and provide additional semantic information. 
- They compare performance of different models like RoBERTa, BERT, LLaVA, and VisualBERT on classifying persuasion techniques from the meme text and image, with and without generated captions.
- Their best model is ConcatRoBERTa, which combines CLIP encoder and RoBERTa with an MLP classifier, using meme text, image and GPT-4 generated captions.

Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting persuasion techniques in memes across multiple languages. 
- The improvement from intermediate captioning step highlights metaphorical limitations in visual understanding and potential for enhancing abstract visual semantics.  
- First work analyzing the metaphorical modality gap between vision and language models to gain insight into differences in visual versus textual metaphors.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in multimodal classification of persuasive techniques in memes, while also providing analysis into discrepancies between visual and textual modalities regarding metaphors in state-of-the-art models. The introduced meme captioning step is a simple but effective technique for improving performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a meme caption generation step to improve multimodal classification of persuasion techniques in memes, finding the modality gap poses challenges for visual encoders in understanding metaphorical images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are twofold:

1) Addressing the classification problem of persuasion techniques in memes using multimodal models. The paper explores different models like LLaVA, VisualBERT, and ConcatRoBERTa for hierarchical multi-label classification of persuasion techniques in memes, using both textual and visual content.

2) Investigating the modality gap between textual and image components in multimodal models. The paper introduces an intermediate step of generating captions for memes using LLaVA and GPT-4. This is used to assess the modality gap and the impact of additional semantic information from images. The improvement from generated captions suggests there are metaphorical aspects not fully conveyed from images to text, highlighting potential for improving abstract visual semantics encoding.

In summary, the key contributions are advancing the detection of persuasion techniques in memes through multimodal models, and analyzing the gap between textual and visual modalities in understanding the metaphorical essence of images.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces an intermediate step of meme caption generation before classifying persuasion techniques. Why do you think this extra step helps improve the classification performance? What are some potential reasons that captions provide useful supplemental information?

2. The authors fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5 on the MemeCap dataset for meme captioning. What are some potential issues with domain shift when applying this captioning model to the persuasion technique dataset? How did the authors attempt to mitigate this?

3. What are some key differences between the meme images in MemeCap versus the persuasion technique dataset that might explain why captioning models trained on MemeCap struggle to some extent? How could the captioning process be improved to better handle the persuasion meme images? 

4. The paper analyzes the "modality gap" between textual and visual representations in multimodal models. What specific limitations did the authors identify in how vision encoders like CLIP represent visual aspects versus language models that process text? 

5. The ConcatRoBERTa model combines CLIP image features with RoBERTa text features. Why does ConcatRoBERTa outperform end-to-end models like LLaVA on this task? What explanations are provided in the paper?

6. The authors fine-tune large pretrained language models like RoBERTa and BERT in addition to multimodal models. Why do these unimodal LRMs competitive or better performance compared to larger generative models like Vicuna and LLaVA?

7. The paper introduces a unique take on studying metaphorical gaps between modalities. What new insights does this perspective provide compared to prior work improving vision-language consistency? What future research directions does this open up?

8. The authors use GPT-4's text generation capabilities to create captions. What practical challenges did they face generating captions for this dataset using GPT-4? How did they handle problematic cases?  

9. What would have to be done to deploy the proposed meme analysis pipeline to detect disinformation campaigns at scale? What are some key scalability and robustness concerns?

10. The authors suggest exploring adversarial attacks on the model as future work. What aspects of the approach could be vulnerable? How might generated captions impact adversarial robustness compared to end-to-end models?
