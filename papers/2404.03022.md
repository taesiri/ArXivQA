# [BCAmirs at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Beyond Words: A Multimodal and   Multilingual Exploration of Persuasion in Memes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03022)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Memes often use persuasive techniques to shape public opinion, motivating the need to detect psychological and rhetorical tactics in memes, especially for disinformation campaigns.  
- Current multimodal models do not effectively capture the metaphorical meaning in images, leading to a gap between visual and textual understanding. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a meme captioning step using GPT-4 and LLaVA to assess the modality gap and provide additional semantic information. 
- They compare performance of different models like RoBERTa, BERT, LLaVA, and VisualBERT on classifying persuasion techniques from the meme text and image, with and without generated captions.
- Their best model is ConcatRoBERTa, which combines CLIP encoder and RoBERTa with an MLP classifier, using meme text, image and GPT-4 generated captions.

Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting persuasion techniques in memes across multiple languages. 
- The improvement from intermediate captioning step highlights metaphorical limitations in visual understanding and potential for enhancing abstract visual semantics.  
- First work analyzing the metaphorical modality gap between vision and language models to gain insight into differences in visual versus textual metaphors.

In summary, this paper makes notable contributions in multimodal classification of persuasive techniques in memes, while also providing analysis into discrepancies between visual and textual modalities regarding metaphors in state-of-the-art models. The introduced meme captioning step is a simple but effective technique for improving performance.
