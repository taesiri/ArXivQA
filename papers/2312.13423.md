# [VADIS -- a VAriable Detection, Interlinking and Summarization system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13423)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents VADIS, a system that aims to enhance information access and reproducibility in social sciences research. The key challenge is that social science studies rely heavily on survey variables (SVs) to measure sociological phenomena, but SVs are not well represented or interconnected across relevant information sources like publications and datasets. 

VADIS addresses this by combining text mining and semantic web techniques to identify SVs in publications and link them to the underlying datasets. The main objectives are: (1) Enable search and exploration of SVs in context of publications and datasets, (2) Serve as a demonstrator and testbed for the developed methods, (3) Support future integration into production systems like GESIS Search.

The system has three key components: 
(A) Data Preprocessing: Retrieves publication metadata, texts, datasets, SVs from sources like GESIS Search and SSOAR. 
(B) VADIS Modules: Provides APIs for summarization, SV identification (classify SV sentences and match to variables), and overall data integration.
(C) VADIS UI: Enables search and exploration of interlinked publications, summaries, variables, and datasets.  

Key technical innovations include cross-lingual summarization models, distillation for efficiency, SV sentence classification and semantic matching models.  

Preliminary user tests validate the approach - users appreciated the variable links and extreme summaries. Limitations found were issues in result ranking and graphical display. Next steps are to address the limitations and integrate successful features into GESIS Search.

In summary, VADIS demonstrates an end-to-end solution to interconnect publications, datasets, and SVs - enhancing access and reproducibility in social sciences research. The methods and UI provide valuable capabilities for researchers, while also guiding integration into production systems.
