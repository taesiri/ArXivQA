# [TimelyGPT: Recurrent Convolutional Transformer for Long Time-series   Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00817)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Time-series transformers have shown promise for natural language processing and computer vision tasks, but their development for time-series data has been limited. 
- Previous research applying transformers to time-series forecasting tasks has focused on small-scale problems and has not consistently outperformed traditional models. Their performance on large-scale time-series data is unexplored.
- This raises doubts about the ability of transformers to effectively scale up and capture temporal dependencies for time-series data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new architecture called Timely Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TimelyGPT) to address these issues.

Key Components of TimelyGPT:

1. Extrapolatable position (xPOS) embedding to capture trend and periodic patterns in long time-series sequences. This helps with extrapolation to unseen future timesteps.

2. Recurrent attention mechanism called Retention to capture global temporal dependencies, modified to handle irregularly sampled data.

3. Convolutional tokenization and temporal convolution modules to extract multi-scale local features and interactions from raw input.

Main Contributions:

1. Effectively employs xPOS embedding to discern trend and seasonal components in continuous (e.g. biosignals) and irregularly-sampled (e.g. electronic health records) time-series.

2. Extends recurrent attention to accommodate irregularly sampled time-series data common in healthcare.

3. Introduces convolution subsampling tokenizer and temporal convolution to extract nuanced local interactions from time-series data at multiple scales.

Key Results:

- TimelyGPT shows superior long-term extrapolation ability (e.g. 6000 timestep forecasting) compared to transformer baselines.

- Outperforms baselines in classification tasks on various time-series datasets including biosignals and electronic health records.

- Achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy on irregularly-sampled longitudinal patient data.

Implications:
- Advocates shift from small-scale modeling to large-scale pre-training for time-series transformers.
- Demonstrates promise of using pre-trained transformers to extract representation from limited labeled time-series data common in healthcare.
