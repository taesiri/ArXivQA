# [Browse and Concentrate: Comprehending Multimodal Content via prior-LLM   Context Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12195)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that empower large language models (LLMs) with visual abilities fall short in comprehending context involving multiple images. This is due to "prior-LLM modality isolation", which means the visual features for each image are encoded individually by frozen encoders before feeding into the LLM backbone. This leads to two issues - "image-text isolation" where generic visual features overlook crucial target-specific information, and "inter-image isolation" where images lack awareness of relevant content from other images.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a "browse-and-concentrate" paradigm with two phases to enable prior-LLM multimodal context fusion:

1) Browsing Phase: Browses through the entire input to generate a "condition context vector" summarizing the main intent and visual information. 

2) Concentrating Phase: Comprehends the multimodal inputs guided by the condition context vector from phase 1.

The paper explores two implementations:
(1) Explicit (Brote-EX): separate models for browsing and concentrating phases.  
(2) Implicit (Brote-IM): shared parameters between phases.

Additionally, tailored training strategies are proposed:
- Context-enhanced pre-training to utilize condition vectors 
- Condition-aware task fine-tuning to handle missing input modalities

Main Contributions:
- Proposes browse-and-concentrate paradigm to stimulate prior-LLM multimodal context fusion 
- Implements the paradigm via explicit and implicit modes
- Develops specialized training strategies for pre-training and fine-tuning
- Achieves consistent and notable improvements on 7 multi-image benchmarks over strong MLLM baselines

In summary, this paper makes significant contributions in enhancing MLLMs' awareness and comprehension of multimodal context across images through a novel browse-and-concentrate approach and tailored training strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a browse-and-concentrate paradigm with training strategies to enable prior-LLM multimodal context fusion for comprehending multi-image and interleaved inputs by initially browsing through the inputs to gain insights and then revisiting the inputs guided by these insights to achieve more comprehensive understanding.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new paradigm called "Browse-and-Concentrate" (Brote) to address the issue of "prior-LLM modality isolation" in multimodal language models. Specifically:

1) The paper identifies two key issues caused by prior-LLM modality isolation: image-text isolation and inter-image isolation. These issues prevent multimodal LMs from deeply understanding multimodal context involving multiple images.

2) To mitigate these issues, the Brote paradigm is proposed, which includes two phases - "browsing" and "concentrating". The browsing phase generates a condition context vector encapsulating key information from the multimodal inputs. The concentrating phase then comprehends the full inputs guided by this condition vector.

3) Two implementations of Brote are explored - an explicit mode (Brote-EX) using separate models, and an implicit mode (Brote-IM) with shared parameters. Additional training strategies are proposed to enhance the model's utilization of the condition vectors.

4) Evaluations on 7 multi-image benchmarks show consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines. Brote helps the model achieve a more comprehensive understanding of interleaved multimodal inputs involving multiple images.

In summary, the key contribution is the new Brote paradigm and associated techniques to enable stronger prior-LLM multimodal context fusion and comprehension of multi-image inputs.
