# [One-Shot Averaging for Distributed TD($位$) Under Markov Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08896)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, where given a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and a policy, the goal is to estimate the value function (expected discounted total reward) associated with each state under the policy. Specifically, the paper focuses on the distributed setting with N agents, where each agent has a copy of the MDP and policy but transitions are sampled independently. The key question is whether the N agents can cooperate to evaluate the policy N times faster compared to a single agent.

Prior Works & Limitations:
Prior works have studied distributed temporal difference (TD) methods and shown linear speedup is possible but require either many rounds of communication (O(T) for T steps) or many rounds of averaging (O(N)). A very recent work showed one round of averaging suffices for TD(0) under i.i.d. sampling but handling general Markov sampling is an open problem.

Contributions:
This paper shows that with Markov sampling, independent runs of TD(位) by N agents followed by just one round of averaging their outputs can provide a N times speedup, for large enough T. This holds for both TD(0) and TD(位), significantly reducing communication. The analysis relies on showing the convergence rate of expected updates dominates unexpected updates using concentration bounds from Markov sampling.

Technical Details: 
- Define expected update direction $\bar{g}(\theta)$ and Markov noise $\bar{g}'(\theta)-\bar{g}(\theta)$. Bound Markov noise using uniform mixing time.
- Recursively relate $\|\bar{\theta}_i(t+1)-\theta^*\|$ to $\|\bar{\theta}_i(t)-\theta^*\|$ and Markov noise term.
- Apply lemma to turn recursion into explicit bound.Plug into one-shot averaging analysis.
- Analogous analysis holds for TD(位) by defining expected update $\bar{x}(\theta)$ and using related convergence results.

In summary, the key contribution is formally proving the surprising fact that independent runs with minimal communication can match performance of fully coordinated distributed RL, significantly enhancing scalability.
