# [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Persian: A Preliminary Study   Focusing on ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02403)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for low-resource and morphologically rich languages is an open challenge. 
- There is limited analysis of LLMs' capabilities in the Persian language specifically.

Methodology:
- The authors conduct a comprehensive benchmarking study of LLM performance on diverse Persian language tasks.
- They primarily focus on evaluating ChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) but also assess GPT-4 and OpenChat-3.5.
- Tasks are categorized into classic, reasoning, and knowledge domains. Comparisons are made to existing state-of-the-art Persian models.
- New datasets are introduced for elementary school math questions and math entrance exam problems.
- Prompting strategies are analyzed in detail w.r.t language choice and number of demo shots.  

Findings:
- GPT-4 outperforms other models on most tasks but specialized fine-tuned models are better on some classic NLP tasks.
- ChatGPT models show strengths in reasoning abilities and sentiment analysis.
- Increasing shots consistently improves GPT-4 but not GPT-3.5 or OpenChat-3.5.
- English prompts yield better performance than Persian across models. 
- Translating examples to English boosts GPT-3.5's scores.

Contributions:
- First comprehensive LLM evaluation focused on the morphologically rich Persian language
- Analysis of few-shot learning and prompt engineering for Persian
- New datasets for quantitative and mathematical reasoning in Persian
- Benchmark results and insights to guide future LLM development for Persian
