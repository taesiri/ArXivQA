# [Explicit Motion Handling and Interactive Prompting for Video Camouflaged   Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to detect hidden objects that exhibit high visual similarity to backgrounds. It is challenging to distinguish camouflaged objects from surroundings. 
- For video COD (VCOD), motion cues are important but existing methods either take noisy motion estimation as input or model motion implicitly, restricting detection performance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel Explicit Motion handling and Interactive Prompting framework (EMIP) that handles motion cues explicitly using a frozen pre-trained optical flow model. 
- EMIP has a two-stream architecture for simultaneous camouflaged segmentation and optical flow estimation.
- It introduces an interactive prompting scheme across the two streams, inspired by visual prompt learning. Two modules are proposed:
   - Camouflage feeder: Incorporates segmentation-to-motion prompt to enhance optical flow stream.
   - Motion collector: Incorporates  motion-to-segmentation prompt to enhance segmentation stream.
- The motion prompt is learned via self-supervision since ground truth optical flow is unavailable.
- A long-term variant is proposed to incorporate historical features into the prompt to mitigate short-term errors.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a novel explicit motion handling and interactive prompting framework (EMIP) for VCOD, with two-stream architecture and interactive prompting scheme.
- Designs camouflage feeder and motion collector modules to realize prompt interactions across dual streams.
- Learns prompt via self-supervision and proposes long-term variant to leverage historical information.  
- Achieves new state-of-the-art on VCOD benchmarks, outperforming previous best model by âˆ¼17.0\%/5.5\% average improvement on F-measure/S-measure.

In summary, the paper presents an innovative framework for VCOD that explicitly handles motion, interactively prompts dual streams, and incorporates historical information, achieving compelling performance improvements over existing methods.
