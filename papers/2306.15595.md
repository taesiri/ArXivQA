# [Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Positional   Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, this paper presents Position Interpolation (PI) to extend the context window sizes of pretrained large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA up to 32768 tokens with minimal fine-tuning. The key hypothesis seems to be that interpolating position encodings to match the original context window range is more stable and easier for models to adapt to than directly extrapolating position encodings beyond the trained context length. The paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Position Interpolation for enabling longer context in LLMs.The main research questions/goals addressed in this paper appear to be:- Can Position Interpolation effectively extend LLM context window sizes to very long lengths (e.g. 32768 tokens) with minimal fine-tuning cost?- Can models extended via Position Interpolation make effective use of the much longer context for tasks like language modeling and long document summarization? - Does Position Interpolation preserve model quality relatively well on tasks within the original context window size?- Is Position Interpolation more stable and efficient than directly extrapolating position encodings beyond the trained context length?The central hypothesis seems to be that interpolating position encodings to match the original pre-training distribution is easier for models to adapt to than extrapolating to unseen positions, allowing efficient extension to much longer context windows. The paper aims to demonstrate this both theoretically and empirically.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a method called Position Interpolation (PI) to extend the context window sizes of large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA that use Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). The key ideas of Position Interpolation are:- Instead of extrapolating position encodings beyond the original pre-trained context window, which can lead to unstable attention scores, PI downscales the position indices to fit within the original context window. This allows the model to leverage the original trained range of relative positions and differences.- PI linearly interpolates the position encodings between integer positions to accommodate more tokens, rather than extrapolating which can cause attention scores to blow up. - Theoretically, the paper shows the upper bound of interpolated attention scores is much smaller than extrapolated ones, demonstrating the stability of the approach.- PI allows extending the context window of LLaMA models from 2048 to up to 32768 tokens with minimal fine-tuning, while retaining performance on original tasks.- Experiments demonstrate the extended models achieve lower perplexity on long sequences, can retrieve passkeys from documents 32x longer, and perform competitively on long document summarization.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing Position Interpolation, an effective and low-cost method to significantly extend the context window sizes of existing LLMs like LLaMA while preserving most of their original capabilities. This enables building powerful models for long context tasks without full retraining.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary: The paper introduces Position Interpolation to extend the context window sizes of large language models like LLaMA up to 32 times the original size with minimal fine-tuning, while preserving performance on tasks within the original context window.
