# [Learn Suspected Anomalies from Event Prompts for Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) methods rely on multiple instance learning (MIL) to distinguish normal and abnormal video snippets at the video level, without specifying the type of anomaly. This leads to ambiguity in detecting anomalies within abnormal videos. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called "LAP" to guide the learning of suspected anomalies from event prompts. A prompt dictionary listing potential anomaly events is created. The semantic similarity between prompts and generated captions of anomaly videos is calculated to identify the most suspected anomalies for each snippet.  

This enables:
1) A new multi-prompt learning process to constrain visual-semantic features across videos
2) Labeling of pseudo anomalies for self-training

Key Contributions:
1) First work to introduce textual abnormal event prompts for video anomaly detection. Anomaly definitions are learned implicitly from prompt features.

2) A new multi-prompt learning strategy to provide overall understanding of normal/abnormal patterns across videos, overcoming limitations of MIL.

3) Additional pseudo anomaly labels are extracted based on prompt-video similarity to train the predictor effectively in a self-supervised manner.

The proposed LAP framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets - XD-Violence, UCF-Crime, TAD and ShanghaiTech. It also shows promising generalization ability for open-set cases and cross-dataset evaluation.
