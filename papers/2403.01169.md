# [Learn Suspected Anomalies from Event Prompts for Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01169)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) methods rely on multiple instance learning (MIL) to distinguish normal and abnormal video snippets at the video level, without specifying the type of anomaly. This leads to ambiguity in detecting anomalies within abnormal videos. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called "LAP" to guide the learning of suspected anomalies from event prompts. A prompt dictionary listing potential anomaly events is created. The semantic similarity between prompts and generated captions of anomaly videos is calculated to identify the most suspected anomalies for each snippet.  

This enables:
1) A new multi-prompt learning process to constrain visual-semantic features across videos
2) Labeling of pseudo anomalies for self-training

Key Contributions:
1) First work to introduce textual abnormal event prompts for video anomaly detection. Anomaly definitions are learned implicitly from prompt features.

2) A new multi-prompt learning strategy to provide overall understanding of normal/abnormal patterns across videos, overcoming limitations of MIL.

3) Additional pseudo anomaly labels are extracted based on prompt-video similarity to train the predictor effectively in a self-supervised manner.

The proposed LAP framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets - XD-Violence, UCF-Crime, TAD and ShanghaiTech. It also shows promising generalization ability for open-set cases and cross-dataset evaluation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called LAP that introduces textual abnormal event prompts to guide the learning of suspected anomalies across videos for improving weakly supervised video anomaly detection.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are three-fold:

1. It introduces textual abnormal event prompts into video anomaly detection for the first time. The score predictor implicitly learns the definition of anomalies from the semantic features of anomaly prompts, leading to good performance on open-set and cross-dataset cases. 

2. A new multi-prompt learning strategy is proposed to provide an overall understanding of normal and abnormal patterns across different videos, while MIL is limited to individual videos.

3. Additional pseudo labels are excavated from the anomaly videos according to the semantic similarity between the event prompts and videos. They are used to train the predictor effectively in a self-supervised manner.

In summary, the key novelty is using a textual prompt dictionary to guide multi-prompt learning and pseudo anomaly labeling, enabling more effective weakly supervised video anomaly detection. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

The paper proposes a novel framework called "LAP" (Learn suspected Anomalies from event Prompts) for weakly supervised video anomaly detection. It utilizes a prompt dictionary to provide textual descriptions of potential anomaly events, compares them to the generated captions from videos to identify suspected anomalies, and uses this information to guide multi-prompt learning and pseudo anomaly labeling to improve anomaly detection. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several VAD datasets and strong capability for open set and cross-dataset scenarios.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new framework called LAP to learn suspected anomalies from event prompts. Can you explain in detail how the prompt dictionary is constructed and how it helps identify suspected anomalies? 

2. The paper introduces a new multi-prompt learning strategy. How is it different from the commonly used multiple instance learning (MIL) framework? What are the advantages of this new strategy?

3. The anomaly similarity matrix Psi is a key component that links abnormal video snippets across videos. How is Psi computed? What kind of information does it provide?

4. The paper extracts both visual features and semantic features for video snippets. Why is feature fusion/alignment important in this framework? What fusion/alignment method is used? 

5. The pseudo anomaly labeling module uses a dynamic threshold to determine anomaly labels. What is this threshold based on and why is a dynamic threshold preferred over a static one?

6. How does the overall LAP framework train the anomaly score predictor? Explain how the multi-prompt learning loss and pseudo anomaly loss work together.  

7. What are the main contributions of this paper? How does it advance the state-of-the-art in weakly supervised video anomaly detection?

8. The paper demonstrates promising performance in open-set cases. What is an open-set case and why is model performance usually lower in such cases? How does LAP address this challenge?

9. Cross-dataset performance is another strength highlighted. What makes cross-dataset evaluation challenging? How does LAP's use of semantic features and prompts help tackle this issue?

10. The MPL and PAL modules seem generic. Can they be incorporated into other existing WS-VAD frameworks? What experiments did the paper conduct to analyze the plug-and-play potential?
