# [RAT: Reinforcement-Learning-Driven and Adaptive Testing for   Vulnerability Discovery in Web Application Firewalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07885)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes RAT (Reinforcement-Learning-Driven and Adaptive Testing), an automated black-box testing strategy to efficiently discover injection vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting in Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). RAT uses n-gram tokenization to extract patterns from attack payloads and cluster similar attacks together. It then applies a reinforcement learning algorithm called decayed Îµ-greedy policy along with a novel adaptive search technique to find clusters containing bypassing attacks and select payloads most likely to bypass the WAF. Comparative experiments show RAT performs much better than state-of-the-art methods ML-Driven E, ART4SQLi, and XSSART in terms of discovering more bypassing attacks given a budget of requests. Testing on real-world custom WAFs also demonstrates RAT is practical, needing only 2.83 and 4.44 requests on average to find each SQLi and XSS bypassing attack respectively. Key innovations are the use of n-gram tokenization for pattern extraction, attack payload clustering, and the adaptive search method to effectively guide testing. RAT shows the promise of using reinforcement learning and adaptive search strategies for automated vulnerability discovery in WAFs.
