# [Generating Clarification Questions for Disambiguating Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generating Clarification Questions for Disambiguating Contracts":

Problem:
- Contracts serve as important sources of project requirements for enterprises. However, deciphering contractual clauses is difficult for non-legal stakeholders (e.g. engineers, analysts) due to the complexity of legal language. 
- Ambiguous clauses can lead to misunderstandings and disputes. Non-legal stakeholders need an unambiguous understanding of clauses to formulate actionable requirements.
- Existing NLP techniques for clarification question generation (CQGen) cannot handle long, unstructured contracts and lack labeled data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ConRAP, a retrieval-augmented prompting framework to detect contract ambiguities and generate clarification questions. 
- It uses "attribute prompting" to comprehensively identify vague, incomplete or missing attributes in sentences that are sources of ambiguity.
- A retrieval-augmented QA module then filters generated questions that are already answered in the contract.
- Remaining unanswered questions highlight ambiguities for non-legal stakeholders to clarify with customers.

Main Contributions:
- ConRAP framework to detect ambiguities and generate clarification questions for contracts using prompting.
- Novel "attribute prompting" technique that outperforms chain-of-thought prompting.
- Corpus of 1000 annotated contractual sentences for document-level ambiguity detection.
- Evaluation showing ConRAP can detect ambiguities with F2 score of 0.87 using ChatGPT. 70% of questions deemed useful by human evaluators.
- Analysis showing separation of local and global context is crucial for performance.

In summary, the paper tackles an important real-world problem of extracting unambiguous requirements from complex contracts using a novel prompting-based framework. The high performance demonstrates the promise of using large language models for legal NLP tasks.
