# [Generating Clarification Questions for Disambiguating Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08053)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generating Clarification Questions for Disambiguating Contracts":

Problem:
- Contracts serve as important sources of project requirements for enterprises. However, deciphering contractual clauses is difficult for non-legal stakeholders (e.g. engineers, analysts) due to the complexity of legal language. 
- Ambiguous clauses can lead to misunderstandings and disputes. Non-legal stakeholders need an unambiguous understanding of clauses to formulate actionable requirements.
- Existing NLP techniques for clarification question generation (CQGen) cannot handle long, unstructured contracts and lack labeled data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes ConRAP, a retrieval-augmented prompting framework to detect contract ambiguities and generate clarification questions. 
- It uses "attribute prompting" to comprehensively identify vague, incomplete or missing attributes in sentences that are sources of ambiguity.
- A retrieval-augmented QA module then filters generated questions that are already answered in the contract.
- Remaining unanswered questions highlight ambiguities for non-legal stakeholders to clarify with customers.

Main Contributions:
- ConRAP framework to detect ambiguities and generate clarification questions for contracts using prompting.
- Novel "attribute prompting" technique that outperforms chain-of-thought prompting.
- Corpus of 1000 annotated contractual sentences for document-level ambiguity detection.
- Evaluation showing ConRAP can detect ambiguities with F2 score of 0.87 using ChatGPT. 70% of questions deemed useful by human evaluators.
- Analysis showing separation of local and global context is crucial for performance.

In summary, the paper tackles an important real-world problem of extracting unambiguous requirements from complex contracts using a novel prompting-based framework. The high performance demonstrates the promise of using large language models for legal NLP tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes ConRAP, a novel framework that combines attribute prompting and retrieval-augmented question answering to detect ambiguities in contractual sentences and generate clarification questions to resolve them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing ConRAP, a novel framework to detect contract ambiguities on a document level and generate clarification questions.

2. Releasing a corpus of 1000 manually annotated contractual sentences for document-level ambiguity detection. 

3. Empirically evaluating the efficacy of ConRAP using different large language models and prompting techniques. 

4. Manually evaluating the usefulness of generated clarification questions using a set of pre-defined parameters.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing the ConRAP framework which combines a novel attribute prompting technique and retrieval-augmented questioning answering to effectively detect ambiguities in contracts and generate useful clarification questions. The paper also contributes a new annotated dataset and an evaluation of ConRAP's performance.

- ConRAP framework

The paper introduces ConRAP, a novel framework for generating clarification questions to detect ambiguities in contractual sentences on a document level. It utilizes retrieval-augmented prompting with large language models like ChatGPT to identify vague, incomplete, or referentially ambiguous attributes in sentences extracted from contracts. The clarification questions generated can help requirements analysts and other non-legal stakeholders elicit clearer and more precise requirements from customer agreements and contracts. The key terms reflect the paper's focus on leveraging AI to improve comprehension of complex legal documents.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The ConRAP framework uses a novel prompting technique called "Attribute Prompting". Can you explain in more detail how this technique works and how it helps to detect ambiguities more comprehensively compared to chain-of-thought prompting?

2. The paper mentions addressing challenges related to the length and complexity of contracts through a combination of attribute prompting and retrieval-augmented QA. Can you expand on why separating the local and global contexts is crucial for boosting the performance of ambiguity detection? 

3. One of the key ideas in ConRAP is to filter candidate clarification questions that are already answered elsewhere in the contract text. What were some of the main challenges in implementing an accurate retrieval-QA model for contracts given their length and complexity?

4. The results show that ConRAP with ChatGPT achieved the best performance with an F2 score of 0.87 for ambiguity detection. Why do you think the framework works well with ChatGPT versus other LLMs? Does the design specifically leverage any ChatGPT-specific capabilities?  

5. Can you discuss some of the main sources of false positives and false negatives encountered when evaluating ConRAP? What are some potential ways to address these issues in future work?

6. The paper focuses on detecting vagueness, incompleteness and referential ambiguity. What considerations would be important if extending the framework to capture other types of ambiguities like lexical, syntactic etc.?

7. One limitation mentioned is the reliance on human annotations for evaluation, which can be time-consuming and introduce biases. Can you suggest some ideas for incorporating automated evaluation to complement or reduce dependence on human ratings?

8. External knowledge integration is called out as an area for future work. What kinds of external knowledge do you think would be most valuable to integrate and how might they help boost reasoning about contract ambiguities?

9. The authors plan to explore modeling different "degrees" of ambiguity in future work. What kinds of prompts or fine-tuning strategies do you think could help capture nuanced degrees of ambiguity rather than binary ambiguous/unambiguous labels? 

10. Could the ideas in ConRAP extend to other domains beyond contracts that also rely heavily on precisely written text - for example in cybersecurity policies or medical literature? What adaptations would need to be made?
