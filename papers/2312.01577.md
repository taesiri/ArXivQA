# [RJHMC-Tree for Exploration of the Bayesian Decision Tree Posterior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01577)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called RJHMC-Tree for efficiently exploring the posterior distribution of Bayesian decision trees. The key innovation is the incorporation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling to jointly update the continuous tree parameters in the proposal step of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This exploits the geometry of the likelihood to generate better tree proposals compared to standard random-walk proposals. Two "softened" parameterizations of decision trees are introduced to enable application of HMC: a soft decision function using logistic probabilities, and a soft input selection method using Dirichlet distributions. The transdimensional nature of varying tree size is handled through the reversible jump framework. Experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that the RJHMC-Tree method results in superior predictive performance, higher acceptance rates, and simpler trees compared to prior Bayesian decision tree sampling algorithms. The method mitigates issues with low acceptance rates and slow posterior exploration that have plagued Bayesian approaches to learning decision trees. Through informed exploitation of the likelihood topology, the new sampling scheme enables more effective posterior inference for this complex tree-based model family.
