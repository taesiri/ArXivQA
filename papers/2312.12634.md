# [MotionScript: Natural Language Descriptions for Expressive 3D Human   Motions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12634)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing text-to-motion methods lack the specificity to generate subtle motion variations described in natural language directions. They rely on high-level textual representations that struggle to capture fine-grained details and expressivity.  
- Lack of training data that contains precise alignments between granular text descriptions and motions.

Proposed Solution:
- MotionScript - a motion-to-text conversion algorithm to generate detailed natural language descriptions directly from 3D skeleton motions without requiring any training data.

Key Details:
- Builds on PoseScript by extending to temporal domain to describe dynamics of joint movements.
- Defines "posecodes" to quantify pose attributes and "motioncodes" to capture transitions in posecodes over time.
- Applies rules to select important motioncodes, aggregate them spatially and temporally, and convert them to sentences.

Contributions:
1. Introducing MotionScript to automatically generate captions from motions to augment existing datasets.
2. Experiments showing improvements in text-to-motion task when trained on MotionScript augmented data.
3. Demonstration of using MotionScript as intermediate representation to leverage LLMs for generating complex unseen motions.

Conclusion:
- MotionScript provides more granular text-motion pairs to enable sensitivity to subtle motion variations.
- Bridges gap between motions and language to promote applications like zero-shot text-to-motion, sign language generation.
- Potential to extend to broader time-series data needing textual representations.
