# [Bifurcated Attention for Single-Context Large-Batch Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08845)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Inference latency and efficiency is a major challenge for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. A key bottleneck is the memory I/O during incremental decoding, especially with long input contexts and high batch sizes. 

- Specifically, loading the cached key-value (KV) pairs from the input context dominates memory I/O costs during incremental decoding. This significantly impacts latency when:
  (1) Generating multiple samples from a single long context (high batch size)
  (2) Handling very long input contexts, even for a single sample

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate generalized multi-query attention, which provides continuum between multi-head and multi-query attention based on the number of attention groups $g$. Lower $g$ compresses KV cache leading to faster inference but may require larger model size to match capabilities.

- Introduce "bifurcated attention", which splits attention during incremental decoding into two parts: (1) context attention (using shared KV cache) (2) decoding attention. This bifurcation reduces redundant memory I/O of context KV cache while maintaining identical results.

- Bifurcated attention works with any multi-group attention, including multi-query, and enables extreme batch sizes and context lengths not possible otherwise.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis of capabilities vs inference efficiency trade-offs with multi-group attention
- Novel "bifurcated attention" technique that reduces KV cache memory I/O during incremental decoding 
- Demonstration of multi-query + bifurcated attention supporting batch size up to 512 within same latency budget
- Quantification of accuracy improvements from increased batch size under fixed latency constraint in code generation

In summary, the paper introduces techniques to significantly lower inference latency bottlenecks, especially for long contexts and high batch sampling, enabling more practical deployment of large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a novel context-aware bifurcated attention method that reduces redundant memory IO costs during language model inference by efficiently handling shared context across samples, enabling higher batch sizes and longer contexts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel technique called "bifurcated attention" to reduce the memory I/O cost and inference latency of transformer language models, particularly for the single-context batch sampling scenario. 

Specifically, bifurcated attention divides the attention computation during incremental decoding into two parts - one focusing on the context key-value cache, and another on the key-value cache from previous decoding steps. This allows more efficient handling of the shared context across multiple sampled outputs. 

The bifurcated attention achieves the same results as the original transformer attention using identical FLOPs, but with much lower memory I/O requirements. This enables lower latency and supports larger batch sizes or longer contexts for real-time applications like code generation.

The paper also analyzes multi-query attention and shows bifurcated attention is compatible, further improving efficiency. Overall, bifurcated attention provides a complementary way to accelerate transformer inference without compromising accuracy or computations.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Bifurcated attention - The proposed method to split attention into context and decoding components to reduce memory IO.

- Single-context batch sampling - The inference scenario where multiple completions are generated from a single context.

- Memory IO - Memory input/output operations which can bottleneck inference latency.  

- Multi-query attention - Attention method with higher compression of key/value tensors for efficiency.

- Generalized multi-query attention - Unified view relating multi-head and multi-query attention.

- Scaling laws - Analysis of model capabilities with respect to size for different attention types.  

- Latency reduction - Key benefit of techniques like bifurcated attention and multi-query attention.

- Applications - Example use cases that require low latency inference such as code generation.

The core concepts focus on improving inference efficiency, especially for single-context batch sampling, using techniques like bifurcated attention and multi-query attention. The analysis examines capability and latency tradeoffs. Potential applications that can benefit are also discussed.
