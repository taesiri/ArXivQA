# [The Contemporary Art of Image Search: Iterative User Intent Expansion   via Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01656)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an intent expansion framework for image search systems to improve users' search experience. The framework has two main components - intent parsing and logic composition. The intent parsing module uses vision-language models to accurately interpret search intents from both textual and visual inputs. For example, it can understand a complex query like "an expensive bored ape wearing a red hat but no glasses." The logic composition integrates multiple parsed intent elements using relations like intersection and exclusion to allow more sophisticated composed search. For instance, it can combine a visual element selected from one image with a textual description for the desired change. In addition, the framework supports contextualized cross-modal interactions, enabling users to iteratively refine search based on initial results instead of starting over. For instance, users can select an unwanted visual element in the result to exclude it from subsequent search. To validate the framework, the authors developed a prototype system for NFT image search and conducted a 16-participant user study. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the intent expansion in enhancing search accuracy, flexibility, enjoyability and willingness to continue using the system. The unique contributions include gathering design requirements, proposing the novel framework, implementing an exemplar system, and evaluating with real users.
