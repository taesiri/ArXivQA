# [SOAR: Scene-debiasing Open-set Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01265)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Current open-set action recognition (OSAR) methods are biased towards using background scene information to make predictions. This makes them vulnerable to performance degradation when the testing scene distribution shifts away from the training distribution. The paper hypothesizes that:1) Existing OSAR methods rely heavily on background scene cues and fail in two typical scenarios: a) recognizing known actions in unfamiliar scenes (low precision) and b) recognizing unknown actions in familiar scenes (low recall).2) By reducing the scene bias in OSAR models through the proposed Scene-debiasing Open-set Action Recognition (SOAR) method, the OSAR performance can be improved, especially when the testing scene distribution is different from training.Specifically, the paper proposes that by using:- An adversarial scene reconstruction module (AdRecon) to remove scene information from extracted features.- An adaptive adversarial scene classification module (AdaScls) to learn scene-invariant features.The resulting SOAR method will have lower reliance on scene cues, reduce scene bias, and improve OSAR performance when scene distributions shift. Experiments are designed to quantify scene bias and demonstrate the effectiveness of SOAR modules in improving OSAR metrics and reducing scene bias.In summary, the central hypothesis is that reducing scene bias in OSAR models through the proposed SOAR method can improve OSAR performance when testing/training scene distributions differ. The paper aims to demonstrate this through bias analysis, proposed techniques, and OSAR performance experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a method called Scene-debiasing Open-set Action Recognition (SOAR) to mitigate scene bias in open-set action recognition (OSAR). The method features two modules - an adversarial scene reconstruction module (AdRecon) and an adaptive adversarial scene classification module (AdaScls). 2. It analyzes the scene bias of current OSAR methods through quantitative experiments. The results show a strong correlation between testing scene distribution shift and OSAR performance, indicating that current methods rely heavily on scene cues. The proposed SOAR method achieves the lowest scene bias.3. It introduces the adversarial scene reconstruction module that forces the backbone to reduce scene information in the learned features by preventing a decoder from reconstructing the video background. This helps preserve motion information.4. It proposes the adaptive adversarial scene classification module to learn scene-invariant action features. This module focuses on confusing scene classification given video features, with emphasis on the action foreground areas guided by the uncertainty map.5. Extensive experiments on standard datasets UCF101, HMDB51 and MiTv2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in SOAR. The method achieves state-of-the-art OSAR performance and the lowest scene bias compared to previous methods.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the SOAR method with two novel modules to mitigate scene bias in OSAR. Both quantitative analysis and experiments validate its effectiveness.
