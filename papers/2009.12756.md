# [Answering Complex Open-Domain Questions with Multi-Hop Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12756)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes and investigates a multi-hop dense retrieval approach for answering complex open-domain questions. The central hypothesis is that extending dense retrieval techniques to a recursive, multi-hop setting can allow complex QA tasks to be solved accurately and efficiently without relying on corpus-specific structures like hyperlinks. The key research questions addressed are:- Can dense retrieval methods be extended to a multi-hop setting to handle complex questions that require aggregating information from multiple text passages? - Does a recursive dense retrieval approach work better than prior methods that rely heavily on hyperlink structure or question decomposition when answering multi-hop open-domain questions?- Can a simple recursive dense retriever match or exceed the performance of prior systems while being much more efficient?To summarize, the central hypothesis is that recursive dense retrieval can effectively find multi-hop reasoning chains in unstructured corpora. The key research questions examine whether this hypothesis holds compared to prior approaches, and whether the proposed method can improve accuracy and efficiency on complex open-domain QA datasets. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the recursive dense retrieval approach on two multi-hop QA datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the key contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a simple and efficient multi-hop dense retrieval approach for answering complex open-domain questions. In contrast to previous solutions, this method does not require any corpus-specific information like inter-document hyperlinks or human-annotated entity markers. It can be applied to any unstructured text corpus.2. The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multi-hop QA datasets - HotpotQA and multi-evidence FEVER. It significantly outperforms previous methods like graph traversal over hyperlinked passages.3. Compared to existing systems that rely on large pretrained models to process hyperlinked passages, this system has much better efficiency vs accuracy trade-off. It matches the best published accuracy on HotpotQA while being 10x faster at inference time.4. The simplicity of the framework and its independence from corpus-specific structures makes multi-hop retrieval methods easily applicable to different domains and settings.5. The paper provides analysis on model variations like question decomposition, and empirically compares extractive vs generative reader models. It helps better understand the unique challenges of multi-hop QA compared to single-hop open-domain QA.In summary, the main contribution is a simple yet effective recursive dense retrieval approach for multi-hop open-domain QA that achieves new state-of-the-art results while being highly efficient. The generality of the framework also opens up broader applications of multi-hop methods.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a simple and efficient multi-hop dense retrieval approach for answering complex open-domain questions that achieves state-of-the-art performance on two multi-hop datasets without requiring corpus-specific information like hyperlinks, and matches the best accuracy on one dataset while being 10x faster.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:- The paper presents a new approach for multi-hop question answering, proposing a recursive dense retrieval method. Other recent work on multi-hop QA has focused on methods like graph traversal over knowledge graphs or hyperlink graphs, so this presents a different paradigm that doesn't rely on explicit graph structure.- Compared to other dense retrieval techniques for QA, this paper evaluates the approach specifically for multi-hop questions, whereas most prior work focused on single-hop factoid QA. The recursive nature of the model is novel for adapting dense retrieval to multi-hop questions.- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on two multi-hop QA datasets. This shows the approach is competitive or superior to prior methods. The improved efficiency is a notable advantage over graph-based methods that require more intensive processing.- The approach does not use any dataset-specific information like hyperlinks or annotated entities. This makes it more generalizable than systems tuned specifically for datasets like HotpotQA that exploit such features. The applicability to general text corpora is a strength.- The analysis provides useful comparisons to alternatives like question decomposition for retrieval. It helps motivate the design choices like using a shared encoder rather than separate question and passage encoders. The ablation studies systematically evaluate contributions.- The retrieval-focused evaluation provides insight into the sources of improvement versus prior multi-hop QA systems. The examination of the impact on end task performance also validates the utility of the better retrieval results.Overall, the paper makes valuable contributions to the area of multi-hop open-domain QA. The recursive dense retrieval paradigm is shown to be effective, achieving state-of-the-art results in a more generalizable and efficient manner compared to prior methods. The analysis and experiments are thorough and help motivate the approach.
