# [EtC: Temporal Boundary Expand then Clarify for Weakly Supervised Video   Grounding with Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02483)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes EtC (Expand then Clarify), a novel framework to improve weakly supervised video grounding (WSVG) models by expanding initial pseudo temporal boundaries to more complete ones using descriptions from multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and then clarifying the boundaries to refine them. Current WSVG methods struggle with incomplete localization due to the absence of boundary annotations. Explicit supervision methods bridge this gap by generating pseudo-boundaries, but risk losing critical information during data augmentation. EtC takes a new perspective - enhancing models by supplying additional valuable information while maintaining video content integrity. It first uses MLLMs to comprehensively describe frames within initial pseudo-boundaries, getting expanded boundaries. Though descriptive, MLLMs introduce irrelevant information, causing overinclusive boundaries. Thus, EtC clarifies boundaries using: (1) Mutual learning between initial (incomplete yet clean) and expanded (comprehensive yet noisy)  boundaries, and (2) A novel proposal-level contrastive loss to harmonize and balance both boundaries to get precise ones. Experiments on Charades-STA and ActivityNet show EtC significantly improves state-of-the-art for WSVG. Ablations validate the efficacy of each component. EtC provides a new direction leveraging powerful MLLMs to expand valuable information for improving weakly supervised temporal localization, instead of risking the loss of critical information.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Expand then Clarify (EtC) that uses multimodal large language models to expand initial pseudo boundaries for weakly supervised video grounding and then clarifies the expanded noisy boundaries for more precise localization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new perspective for weakly supervised video grounding (WSVG) that maintains the integrity of the original temporal content while introducing additional useful information to expand the incomplete boundaries. 

2. It proposes the EtC (Expand then Clarify) framework, which first uses multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to expand the initial pseudo boundaries with more comprehensive descriptions, and then clarifies the resulting noisy expanded boundaries with a tailored proposal-level contrastive loss and mutual learning strategy.

3. It designs a novel proposal-level contrastive (PCL) loss to clarify the expanded pseudo-boundaries via both multimodal and unimodal alignment by ensuring the matching scores within the boundaries are higher than those outside. 

4. Extensive experiments on two challenging WSVG datasets Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in significantly improving the state-of-the-art. The method can be easily extended to existing WSVG methods and boost their performance.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a new EtC framework to improve WSVG by expanding and then clarifying the boundaries with additional useful information from MLLMs, instead of risking the loss of critical information. The novel PCL loss and experimental results also validate its effectiveness.

The paper proposes a new "expand then clarify" (EtC) framework to improve weakly supervised video grounding models by first expanding initial pseudo temporal boundaries using detailed descriptions generated by MLLMs, and then clarifying the resulting noisy expanded boundaries using mutual learning and a tailored proposal-level contrastive loss. Key goals are providing additional useful information to expand boundaries while maintaining video temporal content integrity, and striking a balance between incomplete yet clean initial boundaries and comprehensive yet noisy expanded ones.
