# [Learning Clothing and Pose Invariant 3D Shape Representation for   Long-Term Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10658)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we extend person re-identification to long-term scenarios with clothing changes and diverse activities, by disentangling identity and non-identity features (pose, clothing, etc.) in 3D shape representation?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The most reliable identity cue for long-term person re-id is the 3D naked (unclothed) body shape, if it can be accurately estimated from a 2D image. 2) Jointly modeling the 3D shape and texture of clothed humans, and disentangling identity from non-identity components, can enable effective long-term person re-id despite clothing changes and pose variations.3) Learning discriminative 3D shape features for the naked body, guided by reconstructing complete 3D clothed body shapes, can enhance long-term person re-id performance.So in summary, the central research question is how to do long-term person re-id robust to clothing and pose changes by disentangling identity and non-identity shape/texture features in 3D. The key hypotheses are that 3D naked body shape is the most reliable identity cue, and that jointly modeling 3D clothed shape+texture and disentangling identity can enable effective long-term re-id.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. The authors propose a new method called 3DInvarReID for long-term person re-identification that can handle changes in clothing and diverse human activities. The key idea is to disentangle identity features (related to the naked body shape) from non-identity features (related to clothing, pose, etc.) in 3D space.2. They develop a joint two-layer implicit representation to model a textured 3D clothed human. This allows modeling the identity shape, clothing shape, and texture in a disentangled manner. 3. They collect a new long-term person re-identification dataset called CCDA with images showing clothing changes and diverse activities. This facilitates research on more practical/real-world scenarios compared to existing datasets.4. Through experiments, they demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for long-term person re-id, especially in terms of disentangling identity and non-identity shape features. The method also yields improved 3D body shape reconstruction.In summary, the key contribution is a new approach for robust long-term person re-id by learning to disentangle identity and non-identity features in 3D shape space, validated on a new diverse dataset collected by the authors.
