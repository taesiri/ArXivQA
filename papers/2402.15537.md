# [Evaluating the Performance of ChatGPT for Spam Email Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15537)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Email spam poses significant challenges for users, wasting time and reducing productivity. Accurately identifying and filtering spam emails is crucial for cybersecurity. Recent advances in natural language processing, especially with large language models like ChatGPT, show promise for various text processing tasks, but their potential for spam detection is underexplored.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper evaluates ChatGPT's capabilities for spam identification on English and Chinese email datasets using in-context learning. The authors design prompts and give ChatGPT a few demonstration emails to classify. They also investigate how the number of training examples affects performance. For comparison, five benchmark methods are implemented, including naive Bayes, SVM, logistic regression, feedforward neural networks, and BERT.

Main Contributions:
- Compile a new low-resourced Chinese spam email dataset
- Evaluate ChatGPT's spam detection ability using in-context learning 
- Show that ChatGPT performs much worse than deep supervised learning on a large English dataset 
- Demonstrate ChatGPT's superior performance on the low-resourced Chinese dataset, even outperforming BERT
- Investigate the impact of training example size on ChatGPT's in-context learning performance

In summary, this comprehensive study explores and benchmarks ChatGPT for spam detection across languages and data sizes. Key findings show weaknesses versus deep supervised learning but also unique benefits for low-resource scenarios.
