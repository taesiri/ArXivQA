# [PhenDiff: Revealing Invisible Phenotypes with Conditional Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08290)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes PhenDiff, a new method for image-to-image translation based on conditional diffusion models to reveal subtle phenotype variations between different conditions in biological images. PhenDiff allows translating a real microscopy image from one condition to another in order to spot invisible differences. It first inverts a real image into a latent space, then turns it back into a synthetic image transferred to the target condition. PhenDiff is evaluated on biological datasets and compared to CycleGAN. Results show it achieves higher image quality and diversity. It is able to learn explicit phenotypic changes on treated cell images and apply them to untreated ones. More importantly, when trained on images of healthy and diseased organoids, PhenDiff reveals subtle phenotypic differences invisible to the human eye, namely changes in cell density and division rate. This demonstrates the potential of leveraging diffusion models over GANs for phenotype discovery. Further validation is still required, but PhenDiff could guide biologists towards new cellular biomarkers and disease understanding.
