# CorefDiffs: Co-referential and Differential Knowledge Flow in Document   Grounded Conversations

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an effective method for knowledge selection and dialog flow management in document-grounded conversational systems?More specifically, the authors aim to address the key challenge of how to incorporate smooth transitions between relevant knowledge from the grounding documents when generating responses, in order to produce more natural and coherent dialog flows. The main hypothesis appears to be that leveraging the underlying structure and relationships between knowledge segments, both within documents (intra-document) and across documents (inter-document), can help guide knowledge selection and transitions to better align with human-like conversational flows.To test this, the authors propose a new method called CorefDiffs which represents the documents as a multi-document graph (Coref-MDG) to capture intra- and inter-document knowledge relations. It then combines this graph representation with modeling the differential flow of knowledge from previous turns to perform knowledge selection. The central hypothesis is that jointly modeling these structural relations and dialog history will improve knowledge selection and flow management for document-grounded conversation.The experiments on several datasets aim to validate whether CorefDiffs can outperform current state-of-the-art methods for knowledge selection and response generation, demonstrating the value of their proposed approach for integrating graph-structured knowledge representations with dialog history modeling.In summary, the key research question is how to better leverage document structure and relationships to improve knowledge selection and dialog coherence for document-grounded conversation systems. The CorefDiffs method and multi-document graph are proposed to address this challenge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1) It proposes a new graph structure called Coref-MDG (Multi-Document Co-referential Graph) to model the relationships between knowledge segments within and across documents used for grounding conversations. This graph has topic vertices representing documents, knowledge vertices representing sentences in those documents, and edges capturing co-reference links within documents as well as similarity/commonsense relationships between documents. 2) It develops a methodology called CorefDiffs to leverage this graph structure for knowledge selection in document-grounded conversations. CorefDiffs contextualizes the knowledge representations by propagating information over the Coref-MDG graph, as well as modeling the sequential differences in knowledge between dialogue turns.3) It provides empirical evaluations showing that:- Using Coref-MDG within CorefDiffs substantially outperforms prior methods and other graph variants for knowledge selection across multiple datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness of modeling document structures and relations.- The co-reference and sentence order (topic-knowledge) relations in Coref-MDG are found to be critical, based on analysis of different graph variations.- CorefDiffs also achieves state-of-the-art performance on response generation when paired with existing generators, owing to more accurate knowledge selection.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing a way to effectively integrate document structure and semantics with dialog history context for improving knowledge selection and dialog coherence in document-grounded conversations. The Coref-MDG graph and CorefDiffs methodology seem to be the key novel components enabling this contribution.
