# [Modifying RL Policies with Imagined Actions: How Predictable Policies   Can Enable Users to Perform Novel Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05991)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Users often want to leverage a robot's existing reinforcement learning (RL) policies to accomplish new creative tasks, by partially teleoperating the robot while letting the policy control other parts. 
- However, the user's control signals can bring the policy into out-of-distribution (OOD) states where it acts unpredictably, hindering the user's ability to accomplish their desired task. 
- The paper formalizes this problem and makes the assumption that in novel states, users expect the robot will act similar to how it does in the closest familiar state they have seen before.

Proposed Solution - Imaginary Out-of-Distribution Actions (IODA):
- Uses an OOD detector to identify when the current state is unfamiliar to the user.  
- When OOD, finds the closest state from the policy's rollout history that the user has previously seen.
- Passes this "imagined" familiar state to the policy instead of the true current state.
- Allows the policy to act predictably as if in a familiar state, facilitating the user's task.

Key Contributions:
- Formalizes a problem setting where users leverage RL policies via partial teleoperation to accomplish new creative tasks.
- Proposes the IODA algorithm to make the policy's behavior more predictable when OOD by imagining familiar states.
- Provides a simulation example demonstrating how IODA enables accomplishing tasks unsuccessful with unmodified policies.
- Discusses assumptions on human perception of policies and plans for future user studies.

In summary, the key insight is that for user empowerment, RL policies should act predictably to users even when OOD, rather than unpredictably failing. The IODA algorithm facilitates this by imagining states familiar to the user.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents the Imaginary Out-of-Distribution Actions (IODA) algorithm that modifies the state passed into a reinforcement learning policy by projecting to a familiar state when a user's control brings the policy out-of-distribution, in order to empower users to leverage policies to accomplish new creative tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is the formalization of a problem setting in which a user wants to leverage an existing RL policy to accomplish new tasks by taking partial control, and an algorithm called Imaginary Out-of-Distribution Actions (IODA) to address potential issues that may arise in that setting. 

Specifically, the key elements of the contribution are:

1) Formalizing the problem setting where a user is familiar with an RL policy for a task and wants to take partial control to accomplish new tasks. This includes defining the user's expectation of the policy's behavior and how that may differ when the user takes control.

2) Identifying issues that can occur in this setting - specifically when the user's control takes the policy out-of-distribution, potentially causing unexpected behavior that hinders the user's goals. 

3) Proposing the IODA algorithm to address these issues by detecting when the policy is out-of-distribution and then imagining/projecting to a familiar in-distribution state to choose actions, making the behavior more predictable to the user.

4) Demonstrating IODA in a simple 2D navigation simulation environment.

So in summary, the key contribution is identifying this problem setting, the issues that can occur, and an initial algorithm, IODA, to address those issues to better empower creative use of RL policies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Reinforcement learning (RL) policies
- Teleoperation / Partial teleoperation
- Shared control
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection
- User empowerment 
- Novel/emergent tasks
- Imagined/proxy states
- User predictability 
- Legible robot motion
- Override user control (\parafull / \para)
- Imaginary out-of-distribution actions (\algofull / \algo)

The paper discusses empowering users to leverage RL policies in robots along with teleoperation capabilities to accomplish new and creative tasks on the fly. Key ideas include detecting when user control signals bring the RL policy out-of-distribution, using "imagined" in-distribution states so that the robot's behavior remains predictable to the user, and facilitating user predictability of robot motion. The proposed \algo algorithm aims to address these challenges. So those would be some of the central keywords and terms associated with this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The key insight of the IODA method is that the robot should act as if it were in a state similar to its current state that is also "in-distribution" with respect to the user's experience. Why is this important? How does this lead to more predictable robot behavior from the user's perspective?

2. In the problem formulation, the user's expectation function $W$ is defined to map from the current state to the anticipated next state. What are some ways this function could be modeled or approximated in practice? What are the challenges associated with accurately modeling user expectations?

3. The IODA method requires an out-of-distribution (OOD) detector trained on the rollout history D. What are some suitable OOD detection methods that could be used? What are the tradeoffs between different OOD detection techniques in this application?

4. The distance function $d$ is used to find the nearest in-distribution state to project onto. What are some considerations in choosing an appropriate distance function $d$ for a given task? How could the choice of $d$ impact the performance of IODA?

5. In the simulation example, Deep SVDD was used for OOD detection. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this technique? What other outlier or novelty detection methods could have been used instead?

6. The simulation uses an optimal controller for the user's control input $u$. In practice, how could human control signals be modeled? What are some challenges in accounting for real human control?

7. The paper plans future user studies to evaluate IODA. What metrics could be used to evaluate the method's impact on user task performance? What experimental design considerations are important for such studies?  

8. How could the concept behind IODA be extended to settings with a continuous action space? What changes would need to be made to the algorithm?

9. The paper assumes the user and robot action spaces $A_U$ and $A_R$ are disjoint. Could the approach work if these spaces overlap? What problems might arise?

10. How can the insights from this work be applied to similar human-robot interaction settings such as shared autonomy? What opportunities exist for cross-pollination of ideas?
