# [Transformer-based Selective Super-Resolution for Efficient Image   Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Transformer-based Selective Super-Resolution for Efficient Image Refinement":

Problem:
Conventional super-resolution (SR) methods have two key limitations - high computational cost for upscaling entire large images, and introduction of extraneous or detrimental information in the background during image refinement. This degrades performance on downstream computer vision tasks. 

Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel Selective Super-Resolution (SSR) algorithm to address these issues. The key ideas are:

1. Partition image into non-overlapping tiles and select tiles containing objects of interest using a computationally efficient transformer-based network. This is done using a pyramid architecture to select tiles at multiple scales.

2. Refine only the selected positive tiles containing objects using a separate transformer-based SR module to reconstruct high-frequency details. Negative tiles without objects directly upscale using shallow features only.  

3. The tile selection module uses cross-attention with a learnable classification token to predict tile classes. A Gumbel-Softmax layer makes discrete decisions on tile categories.

4. The tile refinement module has Positive Tile Refinement (PTR) and Negative Tile Refinement (NTR) paths. PTR uses residual transformer blocks to extract multi-level deep features only for positive tiles. NTR directly upscales negative tiles.

5. A pyramid labeling structure and cross-entropy loss is used to supervise tile selection. L1 loss supervises final image reconstruction.

Main Contributions:

1. Proposes a novel two-stage SSR algorithm to efficiently refine only object-containing tiles in image SR using transformer networks.

2. Introduces computationally efficient tile selection module with pyramid architecture to robustly identify object-containing tiles at multiple scales.

3. Demonstrates SSR enhances visual quality while lowering computational costs by 40% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

4. Validates improved performance of SSR quantitatively on three datasets and using accuracy metrics for downstream tasks like classification and objection detection.
