# [gTBLS: Generating Tables from Text by Conditional Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14457)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating structured tables from unstructured text is an important but challenging task. Prior approaches have struggled to ensure the syntactic validity of generated tables, i.e. equal number of cells across rows and columns.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel two-stage approach called Generative Tables (gTBLS) to address this problem. 

- Stage 1 (Table Construction): Infers the structure of the table (row and column headers) from the input text using a conditional text generation model.

- Stage 2 (Table Content Generation): Formulates questions using the inferred headers from stage 1. An encoder-decoder language model is fine-tuned or utilized in a zero-shot setting to answer these questions using the input text.   

Key Contributions:

- gTBLS modular two-stage approach ensures 100% syntactic validity of all generated tables. This leads to up to 57% reduction in error rates compared to baseline sequence-to-sequence models.

- Reformulation as question answering makes the inter-cell relationships explicit. This results in up to 20% better BERTScores compared to prior work.  

- Demonstrates the ability of large pre-trained LLMs to perform table content generation in a zero-shot setting, presenting a solution when fine-tuning is infeasible.

- The question-answering formulation allows new evidence to be incorporated without full table regeneration.

In summary, the key novelty of gTBLS lies in its modular two-stage approach which splits table generation into explicit steps of structure inference and content generation via question answering. This achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating syntactically valid and accurate tables from text.
