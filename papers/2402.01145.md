# [ReEvo: Large Language Models as Hyper-Heuristics with Reflective   Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are ubiquitous in real-world systems and are NP-hard to solve exactly. As a result, experts need to manually design heuristics through trial-and-error to find approximate solutions. However, manual design of effective heuristics is laborious. Prior methods to automate heuristic design like hyper-heuristics and neural combinatorial optimization have limitations in terms of restricted heuristic spaces, lack of generalizability, and high computational demand.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs) which leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to explore an open-ended space of heuristics with minimal human intervention. The paper also proposes Reflective Evolution (ReEvo) which combines evolutionary computation with humanoid reflections by the LLM to search for effective heuristics. 

ReEvo has a generator LLM to output heuristic code and a reflector LLM to provide short-term and long-term reflections on the heuristics to guide evolution. It also evaluates heuristics and uses selection, crossover and mutation over generations to optimize the heuristics. The reflections make the search landscape smoother and help infer underlying problem structure.

The paper evaluates ReEvo extensively on 12 COP settings including traveling salesman, vehicle routing, multiple knapsack, etc. under both white-box and black-box views. The black-box setting reliably tests if LHHs can handle complex real-world problems.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the concept of Language Hyper-Heuristics which bridges LLM-based heuristic design and decades of hyper-heuristic research

- Proposes Reflective Evolution which couples humanoid reflections and evolutionary computation to effectively search heuristic spaces

- Evaluates LHHs reliably using black-box prompting to ensure robust performance on complex problems

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of ReEvo generating solvers for 12 COPs within minutes

- Showcases potential of LHHs to revolutionize design automation for novel applications with robust black-box performance
