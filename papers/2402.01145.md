# [ReEvo: Large Language Models as Hyper-Heuristics with Reflective   Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01145)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are ubiquitous in real-world systems and are NP-hard to solve exactly. As a result, experts need to manually design heuristics through trial-and-error to find approximate solutions. However, manual design of effective heuristics is laborious. Prior methods to automate heuristic design like hyper-heuristics and neural combinatorial optimization have limitations in terms of restricted heuristic spaces, lack of generalizability, and high computational demand.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs) which leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to explore an open-ended space of heuristics with minimal human intervention. The paper also proposes Reflective Evolution (ReEvo) which combines evolutionary computation with humanoid reflections by the LLM to search for effective heuristics. 

ReEvo has a generator LLM to output heuristic code and a reflector LLM to provide short-term and long-term reflections on the heuristics to guide evolution. It also evaluates heuristics and uses selection, crossover and mutation over generations to optimize the heuristics. The reflections make the search landscape smoother and help infer underlying problem structure.

The paper evaluates ReEvo extensively on 12 COP settings including traveling salesman, vehicle routing, multiple knapsack, etc. under both white-box and black-box views. The black-box setting reliably tests if LHHs can handle complex real-world problems.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the concept of Language Hyper-Heuristics which bridges LLM-based heuristic design and decades of hyper-heuristic research

- Proposes Reflective Evolution which couples humanoid reflections and evolutionary computation to effectively search heuristic spaces

- Evaluates LHHs reliably using black-box prompting to ensure robust performance on complex problems

- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of ReEvo generating solvers for 12 COPs within minutes

- Showcases potential of LHHs to revolutionize design automation for novel applications with robust black-box performance


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics, which use large language models to automatically generate optimization heuristics with minimal human intervention, and presents Reflective Evolution, an evolutionary framework that incorporates humanoid reflections to guide the language model's search through the space of possible heuristics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Introducing the concept of Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs), which bridges emerging attempts of using large language models (LLMs) for heuristic generation with the established research area of hyper-heuristics. This allows for a theoretical basis and methodology for future research in using LLMs as heuristics generators.

2. Presenting Reflective Evolution (ReEvo), a framework that couples human-like reflections with evolutionary computation to effectively explore the heuristic space using LLMs. ReEvo shows the potential of using self-reflections to provide "verbal gradients" to guide the search.

3. Advocating and proposing "black-box prompting" for more reliable evaluation of LHHs, to prevent "data leakage" and ensure robust performance on complex and novel real-world problems.

4. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of ReEvo and ReEvo-enhanced solvers on 12 combinatorial optimization problems. The results showcase the effectiveness of LHHs and their potential to revolutionize automated algorithm design.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing the LHH concept and ReEvo framework to effectively leverage LLMs for automated heuristic design across a variety of problems, even when only provided a black-box view.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs): An emerging variant of hyper-heuristics that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems, with minimal manual intervention and open-ended heuristic search spaces.

- Reflective Evolution (ReEvo): A framework proposed in this paper that couples humanoid reflections with evolutionary computation to guide LLM heuristic generation, emulating how human experts reflectively design heuristics.

- Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs): The class of NP-hard optimization problems that this paper targets, involving finding optimal configurations from a finite but extremely large set of possibilities. Examples tackled include the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), Orienteering Problem (OP), Knapsack Problem (KP), and Bin Packing Problem (BPP).

- Heuristics: Approximate algorithms used to find reasonably good solutions to hard combinatorial optimization problems in a computationally affordable manner. This paper uses LLMs to automatically generate effective heuristics.

- Evolutionary Computation: Bio-inspired stochastic population-based search algorithms. This paper uses an evolutionary approach to search the space of heuristics generated by the LLM.

- Black-Box Prompting: Prompting the LLM heuristics generator with only a general problem description rather than specifics of the COP. Used to better evaluate robustness and novelty handling.

So in summary - language hyper-heuristics, reflective evolution, combinatorial optimization, heuristics, evolutionary computation, and black-box prompting.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Reflective Evolution (ReEvo) method proposed in this paper:

1) How does ReEvo enable the language models (LLMs) to learn the underlying structure and objectives of black-box combinatorial optimization problems (COPs)? What role do the short-term and long-term reflections play in this?

2) The paper introduces the concept of "Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs)". How does this integrate emerging attempts of using LLMs for heuristic generation with the existing research area of hyper-heuristics? What are the key advantages of LHHs over traditional hyper-heuristics? 

3) The paper argues that black-box prompting provides more reliable evaluation of LHHs than white-box settings. Why is this? How does black-box prompting prevent "data leakage" when evaluating LHHs?

4) How does ReEvo lead to smoother heuristic search landscapes compared to prior LHH methods? Explain the metrics used for fitness landscape analysis and how reflections contribute to better landscape structures.  

5) What are the different ways in which the short-term and long-term reflections in ReEvo emulate and enhance human experts' reflective design process? How do the reflections provide hints and guidance for heuristic improvement?

6) The performance comparisons are extensive, across different heuristic types (e.g. perturbation rules, stochastic sampling biases), COPs (e.g. TSP, VRP) and views (white-box, black-box). What do the results indicate about the effectiveness and generalizability of ReEvo-generated heuristics?

7) How suitable is ReEvo for generating high-performing heuristics when no human expertise is available a priori for a COP? What evidence supports this claim?

8) What modifications were required to implement ReEvo under different heuristic scenarios like perturbation rules, stochastic sampling biases, constructive heuristics? How easy is it to adapt ReEvo to new COPs compared to neural and hyper-heuristic baselines?

9) The paper claims ReEvo can revolutionize algorithm design automation. What specific advantages does it offer over expert design, traditional HHs and neural methods that support this claim? What are limitations? 

10) How can the introduction of LHH lead to new research directions? What theoretical foundations need to be established and what new applications can LHHs target?
