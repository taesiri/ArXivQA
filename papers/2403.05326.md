# [ChatASU: Evoking LLM's Reflexion to Truly Understand Aspect Sentiment in   Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05326)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Aspect sentiment understanding (ASU) in dialogues is an important task but faces two key challenges: 1) Coreference issue - mapping sentiments to aspects is difficult when aspects are referenced through pronouns rather than explicitly stated. 2) Factual hallucination issue - large language models (LLMs) used for ASU often exhibit factual hallucination errors in their predictions. 

- To address these issues, the paper proposes a new task called Chat-based Aspect Sentiment Understanding (ChatASU) with a sub-task of Aspect Chain Reasoning (ACR) to handle coreferences. The paper also collects a new dataset for this task.

Proposed Solution:
- A Trusted Self-Reflexion Approach (TSA) is proposed that uses ChatGLM as the backbone. 

- TSA has two main components: 1) ChatASU Block formulates the ASU and ACR tasks and fine-tunes ChatGLM on them using cross-entropy loss 2) Trusted Enhanced Self-Reflexion Block handles factual hallucinations via trusted learning integrated with reflexion mechanisms and reinforcement learning.

- The ACR task boosts ASU performance by resolving coreferences. Trusted learning enhances credibility of predictions.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes the new ChatASU task and ACR sub-task to address coreference issues in dialogue ASU.

- Integrates trusted learning with reflexion mechanisms to alleviate factual hallucinations in LLMs and enhance their credibility for ASU.  

- Constructs a high-quality Chinese dataset for the ChatASU task.

- Proposes the TSA approach that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in ChatASU by addressing coreference and factual hallucination issues.
