# [Uncovering solutions from data corrupted by systematic errors: A   physics-constrained convolutional neural network approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Data and models can be corrupted by systematic errors from miscalibrated experiments or epistemic uncertainties in models. These errors violate the underlying physical laws that the system should satisfy.  
- The paper aims to develop a method to remove such systematic errors from corrupted data to uncover the true physical solution that satisfies the governing equations.

Proposed Method
- A physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) is proposed to map the corrupted data to the true solution while satisfying the physical constraints. 
- The PC-CNN leverages prior knowledge of the physical laws (encoded as partial differential equations) to regularize its predictions.
- A time-batching scheme is introduced to allow computation of time-dependent residuals without recurrent networks.
- The method is trained by optimizing a loss function with terms penalizing violation of: (i) governing equations, (ii) boundary conditions, (iii) assumption of stationary systematic error.

Evaluations
- The method is evaluated on 3 systems of increasing complexity: linear convection-diffusion, nonlinear Burgers equation, turbulent 2D Navier-Stokes.
- The PC-CNN accurately uncovers solutions from data corrupted by large, multimodal systematic errors.
- Parametric studies demonstrate robustness across varying magnitudes and modalities of corruption.
- For 2D turbulence, recovered solutions satisfy physical properties like energy spectrum statistics.

Main Contributions
- Novel physics-constrained deep learning approach for removing systematic errors from data.
- Demonstration of uncovering solutions of complex chaotic systems from heavily corrupted data.
- Extensive analysis of accuracy, robustness and physical consistency of the framework.
- Potential for enhancing experimental data and low-fidelity simulations across science/engineering.

In summary, the paper develops a physics-constrained convolutional neural network approach for removing systematic errors from data and uncovering the underlying physical solutions. Both accuracy and physical coherence of solutions are demonstrated through applications to partial differential equations of increasing complexity.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method to uncover solutions to partial differential equations from data that is corrupted by systematic errors. Specifically:

- They introduce a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) that can compute the physical residual (where the physical laws are violated due to systematic errors) in the data. 

- They formulate an optimization problem to train the PC-CNN by leveraging prior knowledge of the underlying physical system to regularize the predictions. 

- They demonstrate the ability of the PC-CNN to accurately recover underlying solutions from corrupted data for three PDEs of increasing complexity.

- They show through a parameterized analysis that the method is robust to different magnitudes and degrees of multimodality of systematic errors.

- For the turbulent flow case, they analyze the physical consistency of the recovered solutions in terms of statistics and energy spectrum.

In summary, the main contribution is a method using a physics-constrained deep learning approach to uncover true physical solutions from data corrupted with systematic errors. This has applications in removing errors from models and experiments across scientific domains.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a physics-constrained convolutional neural network (PC-CNN) to uncover solutions to partial differential equations from corrupted data. How does the PC-CNN architecture differ from a standard CNN? What modifications were made to impose physics constraints?

2. The loss function contains three main terms - the residual loss, boundary loss, and systematic error loss. Explain the purpose and formulation of each of these losses. How do they work together to uncover the true underlying solution? 

3. The paper employs a time-batching scheme to compute time-dependent residuals without using RNNs. Explain how the time-batching works. What is the rationale behind choosing a time window size of 2? What are the tradeoffs associated with this choice?

4. The paper tests the method on three PDEs - linear convection-diffusion, nonlinear convection-diffusion, and 2D turbulent flow. Compare and contrast the performance of the method and the associated challenges for each of these cases. 

5. The robustness studies vary both the magnitude and modality of the systematic error. How is the systematic error parameterized? What trends do you notice in the method's performance as these parameters are varied?

6. For the 2D turbulent flow case, various physical properties of the solution are analyzed - kinetic energy over time, energy spectrum. How well does the PC-CNN preserve these physical characteristics compared to the ground truth? Where does it struggle?

7. The paper assumes the availability of clean data at select points on the domain boundary. How does the boundary loss term make use of this data? What would happen if this data was not available?

8. What differences would you expect in performance if experimental rather than simulated data was used? What additional challenges might arise?

9. The method recovers both the underlying solution and the systematic error. In what ways could the recovered systematic error term provide additional insights?

10. How could the ideas presented in this paper be extended to identify and remove systemic errors from experimental data or low-fidelity simulations? What modifications would need to be made?
