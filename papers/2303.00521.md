# [Quality-aware Pre-trained Models for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00521)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop quality-aware pre-trained models for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) that can overcome the problem of insufficient training data. 

The key points are:

- BIQA aims to predict the perceptual quality of images without access to reference images. It is an important task but suffers from lack of labeled training data. 

- The authors propose a self-supervised learning method to pre-train models on large unlabeled datasets like ImageNet in a quality-aware manner.

- They design a more complex image degradation process with operations like shuffle, high-order, and skip to simulate diverse real-world distortions. 

- A quality-aware contrastive loss is used to train the models to distinguish between image patches of different quality levels.

- Experiments show the pre-trained models significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple BIQA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of quality-aware pre-training for this task.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that quality-aware pre-training on large unlabeled datasets can overcome insufficient training data and improve performance on downstream BIQA tasks. The proposed method and experiments support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel self-supervised learning mechanism called Quality-aware Pre-Trained models (QPT) for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). The key idea is to use a pretext task that distinguishes between samples of different perceptual qualities, instead of just semantic content.

2. Designing a more complex degradation process to generate distorted images for pre-training. It incorporates techniques like shuffle order, high-order degradation, and skip connections to create a large and realistic degradation space. 

3. Defining positive and negative sample pairs for contrastive learning based on quality rather than just semantic content. Positives are patches from the same distorted image, negatives are from different distortions or images.

4. Proposing a Quality-aware Contrastive Loss (QC-Loss) to optimize the pretext task. It contrasts positive and negative pairs as defined above.

5. Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on 5 BIQA benchmarks by simply fine-tuning a ResNet50 pretrained with QPT, showing its effectiveness. The pre-trained weights can also boost existing methods.

In summary, the key novelty is designing a pretext task and contrastive learning approach specifically for learning quality-related representations, instead of just semantic content. This allows pre-training on large unlabeled datasets like ImageNet to improve downstream BIQA performance.
