# [Quality-aware Pre-trained Models for Blind Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00521)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop quality-aware pre-trained models for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) that can overcome the problem of insufficient training data. 

The key points are:

- BIQA aims to predict the perceptual quality of images without access to reference images. It is an important task but suffers from lack of labeled training data. 

- The authors propose a self-supervised learning method to pre-train models on large unlabeled datasets like ImageNet in a quality-aware manner.

- They design a more complex image degradation process with operations like shuffle, high-order, and skip to simulate diverse real-world distortions. 

- A quality-aware contrastive loss is used to train the models to distinguish between image patches of different quality levels.

- Experiments show the pre-trained models significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple BIQA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of quality-aware pre-training for this task.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that quality-aware pre-training on large unlabeled datasets can overcome insufficient training data and improve performance on downstream BIQA tasks. The proposed method and experiments support this hypothesis.
