# [FeedbackLogs: Recording and Incorporating Stakeholder Feedback into   Machine Learning Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15475)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to be focused on a single central research question or hypothesis. Instead, the paper introduces the concept of "FeedbackLogs" (\fls) as a new documentation structure to track the input of multiple stakeholders in machine learning pipelines. 

The key aspects of the paper are:

- Proposing \fls{} as addenda to existing ML pipeline documentation, in order to track how stakeholder feedback is collected and incorporated into the pipeline over time. 

- Introducing the structure and components of a \fl{}, including a starting point, records of stakeholder interactions, and a final summary.

- Discussing how \fls{} can provide evidence for algorithmic auditing and updates based on stakeholder feedback.

- Presenting findings from practitioner interviews on the expected benefits and challenges of implementing \fls{}.

- Providing example \fls{} from real-world practitioners and an interactive demo tool.

So in summary, this paper introduces \fls{} and demonstrates their application, rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The overarching goal is to propose a systematic way to document the iterative process of collecting and incorporating stakeholder feedback into ML pipelines.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes FeedbackLogs (\fls), which are addenda to existing ML pipeline documentation, to track how input from multiple stakeholders is recorded and incorporated into the ML pipeline. 

2. It introduces and formalizes the process for collecting a \fl{}, which includes a starting point, one or more records, and a final summary. Each record documents how feedback was elicited, the feedback content itself, and how the feedback was incorporated to update the ML pipeline.

3. It provides concrete examples of how \fls{} can be employed in practice, such as serving as evidence for algorithmic auditing and recording updates based on stakeholder feedback. 

4. It summarizes findings from practitioner interviews on the potential benefits and challenges of implementing \fls{} in real-world settings.

5. It releases an open-source interactive demo tool to make \fls{} more accessible for practitioners to use.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing \fls{} as a new documentation structure to systematically track the iterative process of stakeholder engagement and feedback incorporation throughout the machine learning pipeline lifecycle. The paper demonstrates the utility of \fls{} through examples and practitioner perspectives.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes FeedbackLogs, a new documentation structure to systematically track the iterative process of collecting stakeholder input and incorporating it into machine learning pipelines over time.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

- Focus on stakeholder feedback: This paper proposes a novel approach for systematically documenting and incorporating feedback from stakeholders throughout the machine learning pipeline development process. Many prior works have focused more narrowly on specific forms of documentation like model cards or datasheets. The emphasis on stakeholder perspectives sets this work apart.

- Iterative process: The proposed FeedbackLogs aim to capture the iterative, back-and-forth process of collecting stakeholder input and updating the ML pipeline accordingly. This sets it apart from documentation that just provides static snapshots at certain points. The records in the FeedbackLog allow tracing the evolution of the pipeline in response to feedback.

- Completeness and flexibility: The FeedbackLog structure aims to provide comprehensive details while remaining flexible enough to handle diverse feedback and updates. Other documentation approaches tend to be more rigid or narrowly focused. The modular, template-based design allows FeedbackLogs to be integrated at any point and capture various forms of input.

- Tooling and implementation: This paper goes beyond just proposing an idea by including findings from interviews with ML practitioners on implementing FeedbackLogs, as well as providing a demo tool. This demonstrates feasibility and surfaces challenges around real-world adoption. Many related papers stop at the conceptual stage without testing integration. 

- Stakeholder-centered: The emphasis on stakeholder perspectives, rather than just properties of the model or system, is a shift in focus compared to most documentation paradigms. The elicitation and feedback sections put stakeholder input front and center.

So in summary, the iterative process focus, completeness/flexibility goals, and commitment to tooling/implementation help differentiate this work from related research on ML documentation, auditing, and stakeholder involvement. The novelty lies in the stakeholder-centric approach.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust and efficient algorithms for \fls{}. The authors mention that the current version of \fls{} is a prototype meant to demonstrate the concept, so more research can be done to optimize the actual implementation. For example, they suggest abilities to search/link \fls{}, assign access rights, and customize the level of detail. 

- Integrating \fls{} into existing machine learning workflows and tools. The authors propose building \fls{} functionality into popular ML development frameworks like TensorFlow to make adoption easier. They also suggest linking \fls{} to other documentation like model cards.

- Validating the value of \fls{} through user studies. The authors recommend empirical studies to quantify the benefits of using \fls{}, such as improved model performance, stakeholder satisfaction, or audit preparedness. Surveys and interviews could further refine the \fl{} structure.

- Developing standardized practices around \fls{}. Since \fls{} are a new concept, the authors encourage the research community to converge on protocols for what should be included in \fls{} and how they should be maintained over time. Standards would improve reproducibility across organizations.

- Expanding the types of stakeholders considered. The current examples focus on common stakeholders like end users and regulators, but future work could explore incorporating feedback from other relevant parties.

- Handling sensitive information disclosure through \fls{}. The authors recognize privacy issues with sharing details of stakeholder feedback, and suggest research into anonymization techniques.

- Evaluating the completeness and accuracy of \fls{}. More work is needed to ensure \fls{} fully capture the stakeholder engagement process without introducing practitioner bias. Auditing mechanisms could help.

In summary, the authors point to many open research questions around optimizing, standardizing, validating, and auditing \fls{} through empirical studies with practitioners and stakeholders.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FeedbackLogs (\fls{}) as a new form of documentation to systematically record the process of collecting and incorporating stakeholder feedback into machine learning pipelines. \fls{} are structured into three main components: a starting point describing the initial pipeline, one or more records documenting interactions with stakeholders to collect their feedback and how it is incorporated, and a final summary with the end state of the pipeline after updates from the feedback. Each record contains details on how the feedback was elicited, the actual feedback content, what updates were considered by the practitioners to address the feedback, and a summary of the impact of the chosen update(s). The goals of \fls{} are to provide a complete account of stakeholder involvement, be flexible to integrate at any point in the pipeline development process, and impose minimal overhead on practitioners. The paper demonstrates the use of \fls{} on real-world examples from industry practitioners. It also introduces a web-based tool to generate \fls{} to make adoption easier. Overall, \fls{} aim to systematically capture how stakeholder perspectives shape the development of machine learning pipelines over time.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes FeedbackLogs (FLs), a new form of documentation to track the iterative process of collecting and incorporating stakeholder feedback into machine learning pipelines. The FL contains three main components: a starting point documenting the initial state of the pipeline, one or more records detailing interactions with stakeholders, and a final summary showing the end state after feedback is incorporated. 

Each record in the FL logs how feedback was elicited from a stakeholder, the actual feedback content, and how the feedback was used to update the pipeline. Updates could be to the model itself (e.g. dataset, loss function, parameters) or to the broader ecosystem (e.g. documentation, interface, accountability, deployment details). Tracking the impact of updates helps justify why certain changes were made. The authors demonstrate the flexibility of FLs through real-world examples from industry practitioners. They also provide perspectives from practitioner interviews on benefits and challenges of implementing FLs. Overall, FLs aim to give ML pipelines greater transparency and incorporate stakeholder needs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes FeedbackLogs (\fls{}) as a new form of documentation to track the iterative process of collecting and incorporating stakeholder feedback into machine learning pipelines. The key components of a \fl{} include a starting point describing the initial pipeline, one or more records documenting interactions with stakeholders, and a final summary of the overall changes made. Each record contains details on how feedback was elicited, the actual feedback content, how the feedback was incorporated through updates to the model or ecosystem, and the measured effects of the updates. The authors introduce the structure of \fls{} and provide examples from real ML practitioners, as well as an interactive demo tool. Overall, the main method is proposing \fls{} as a new documentation process, defining the components of a log, and providing examples and a demo to showcase how \fls{} can be used to systematically gather and incorporate stakeholder feedback.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new documentation structure called "FeedbackLogs" (\fls) to track how stakeholder feedback is collected and incorporated into machine learning (ML) pipelines. 

- \fls aim to address the gap that stakeholder perspectives are often not adequately considered in ML model development, and there is little systematic documentation on how their input is recorded and used to update ML pipelines.

- A \fl consists of a starting point, records, and final summary. The records contain details on the feedback elicitation, the actual feedback content, how the feedback was incorporated by making updates to the ML pipeline, and a summary of the impact of the updates.

- Through interviews with ML practitioners, the authors explore the perceived practicality and benefits of using \fls. They also provide example real-world \fls from different industries to demonstrate the flexibility of the structure.

- The paper introduces an interactive demo tool to make it easy for practitioners to generate and work with \fls.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing \fls as a new documentation approach to systematically capture the iterative process of stakeholder involvement and feedback incorporation in ML model development. The paper aims to make stakeholder perspectives more integral to building ML systems.
