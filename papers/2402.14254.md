# [A hierarchical decomposition for explaining ML performance discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14254)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models can often perform worse when applied to new domains or populations, compared to the original domain they were trained on. Understanding why the performance drops in the new domain is important to determine what interventions (algorithmic or operational) could help improve performance. Prior work has focused on either detecting distribution shifts or attributing the overall performance drop to shifts in the input feature distribution versus the label distribution. However, more detailed explanations attributing the performance drop to shifts in each individual feature are lacking, yet critical for precisely targeting interventions. Existing detailed attribution methods make strong assumptions about the data generation process or require knowledge of the causal graph.

Proposed Solution:
This paper introduces a new hierarchical attribution framework called HDPD that first decomposes the overall performance drop into aggregate terms quantifying the impact of shifts in the input feature distribution (covariate shift) and shifts in the label distribution (concept shift). HDPD then provides a detailed attribution for each aggregate term that quantifies the proportion of variation in performance changes across data strata explained by partial shifts in each feature. The attributions do not require knowledge of the causal graph and rely only on hypothesized forms of partial distribution shifts. The paper presents recipes for estimating these detailed attributions for both the covariate and concept shift terms, as well as statistical inference procedures that produce valid confidence intervals, which is especially important when labeled data is limited in the new domain.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a hierarchical performance attribution framework that unifies aggregate and detailed explanations of performance drops 
- Defines partial distribution shifts to attribute performance drops to each feature in a model-agnostic, nonparametric way
- Derives efficient, debiased estimators for the attributions that enable statistical inference
- Demonstrates the utility over existing methods with simulations and case studies from healthcare and census survey data


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key ideas in the paper:

The paper introduces a nonparametric hierarchical framework for explaining performance discrepancies of machine learning models across domains that provides both aggregate decompositions into covariate versus outcome shifts and detailed variable importance values without requiring knowledge of the causal graph.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel hierarchical framework for explaining differences in machine learning model performance across domains or datasets. The key aspects of this framework are:

1) It provides both an aggregate decomposition that splits the total performance difference into components due to shifts in covariates, conditional covariates, and outcome distribution, as well as a detailed decomposition that quantifies the contribution of each variable to each aggregate component using Shapley values. 

2) The framework is nonparametric and does not require knowing the causal graph relating the variables. This makes it more widely applicable compared to some previous methods.

3) The paper provides statistically valid, debiased machine learning estimators for all the terms in the decompositions. This allows constructing asymptotically valid confidence intervals, which is important when there is limited labeled data. 

4) The utility of the framework for providing actionable insights is demonstrated on real-world case studies of predicting hospital readmissions and insurance coverage.

In summary, the main contribution is a principled and practical framework for understanding why machine learning model performance differs across domains, with supporting theory and experiments. The hierarchical explanation at both aggregate and detailed levels and the ability to quantify uncertainty are key distinguishing aspects.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Distribution shift - referring to changes in the data distribution between the source and target domains that can lead to drops in ML model performance

- Feature attribution - quantifying the importance of variables/features in explaining changes in model performance across domains

- Explainability - understanding why an ML model's performance differs across domains 

- Model generalizability - the ability of an ML model to maintain performance when applied to new datasets

- Nonparametric inference - statistical inference without making strict assumptions about the form of the underlying distribution

- Debiased machine learning - methods to reduce bias in estimates from machine learning models to facilitate valid statistical inference

- Hierarchical decomposition - explaining a performance gap at both an aggregate level and more detailed variable-specific level

- Shapley values - a method from cooperative game theory for attributing importance to variables while satisfying certain axiomatic properties

- Confidence intervals - quantifying uncertainty in the estimates of model performance differences

The key terms cover concepts related to explaining and understanding differences in model performance across domains in a rigorous statistical framework.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical framework for explaining performance gaps of ML models across domains. How does this framework improve upon prior work in terms of the type of explanations provided (aggregate versus detailed)?

2. The detailed decomposition relies on quantifying the importance of hypothesized "partial distribution shifts" with respect to variable subsets. What are some of the challenges in defining such partial shifts and how does this work address them?

3. The paper leverages the Shapley value framework to quantify variable importance in the detailed decomposition. What are some of the advantages of using the Shapley framework over simpler approaches like calculating the difference in means?

4. Explain the difference between the proposed approach for detailed decomposition of the conditional covariate versus conditional outcome shift terms. What assumptions must be made about the relationships between variables in each case?

5. The paper claims the estimator for the detailed conditional outcome decomposition has a unique form as a V-statistic. Explain what a V-statistic is and why the estimator takes this form. What are some computational challenges with evaluating V-statistics? 

6. A key theoretical contribution of this work is providing estimators for the decomposition terms along with statistical inference procedures. Explain the high-level strategy used for proving asymptotic normality of the estimators.

7. The estimation strategy relies heavily on density ratio models. What are some best practices and challenges when estimating density ratios between domains?

8. For the detailed decomposition, the paper estimates Shapley values by sampling subsets instead of exact computation. Explain why this approximation strategy still leads to valid statistical inference. What factor controls the inflation of confidence intervals?

9. The framework makes no assumptions about the ML models being explained. Discuss the advantages and limitations of using model-agnostic explanations. When might model-specific explanations be preferred?

10. The method is evaluated on prediction tasks for hospital readmissions and insurance coverage. What are some other potential application domains that could benefit from this type of explanation? What domain-specific challenges might arise?
