# [GrASP: Gradient-Based Affordance Selection for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04772v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we effectively deal with continuous action spaces when using tree-search planning (e.g. Monte Carlo tree search) in reinforcement learning problems with large, continuous action spaces?The key challenge is that with continuous action spaces, it is infeasible to exhaustively evaluate every possible action at each node during tree search. So the authors propose an approach to instead learn a small set of "affordance" actions or options to consider at each node. The main hypothesis seems to be that by using gradients to learn a good set of affordances for planning, they can enable effective tree-search planning with continuous actions, allowing their agent to outperform standard model-free reinforcement learning methods.In summary, the central question is how to do efficient tree-search planning with continuous actions, and the key proposal is to learn good affordance actions/options for consideration at each node using gradients through the planning procedure.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces the algorithm style LaTeX packages for formatting algorithms in papers. The key contributions are:- It provides the \texttt{algorithm} LaTeX package that defines a new floating environment for algorithms, similar to figures and tables. This allows algorithms to be properly numbered, captioned, and referenced within the paper.- The floating algorithm environment supports different layout styles like ruled, plain, or boxed. It also allows controlling the numbering convention, like having algorithms numbered within sections, chapters, etc.- It defines commands like \texttt{\listofalgorithms} to generate a list of algorithms. The name of the list can also be customized.- The package is designed to be highly configurable, with options to control the appearance and numbering of the algorithms. This allows it to be customized for different journal styles.- It is built on top of the standard LaTeX float mechanism, so it integrates well with LaTeX's figure and table placement algorithms.- The goal is to provide a clean solution for presenting algorithms within LaTeX documents in a consistent and customizable manner. This improves over ad-hoc approaches to formatting algorithms.In summary, the key contribution is providing a robust and flexible algorithm environment for LaTeX that makes it much easier to properly format algorithms within academic papers. This improves the readability and professionalism of papers containing algorithms.
