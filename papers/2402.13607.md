# [CODIS: Benchmarking Context-Dependent Visual Comprehension for   Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13607)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in combining vision and language. As they become more widely used, comprehensively evaluating their abilities is crucial. 
- However, most existing benchmarks do not consider that images often need additional context for accurate interpretation. For example, an image alone may be ambiguous about whether a person is ascending or descending stairs.
- Existing vision-language benchmarks lack images paired with explanatory free-form text contexts. They cannot effectively test context-dependent visual understanding.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a new benchmark called CODIS to evaluate MLLMs' ability to leverage context to disambiguate ambiguous images.
- CODIS uses a visual question answering format. Images contain inherent ambiguity that requires external context to resolve. Questions highlight this ambiguity. 
- Each image-question pair has two different free-form text contexts leading to different interpretations and answers.
- Context types covered include: location/orientation, temporal info, cultural background, object attributes, and people relationships.

Contributions:
- Highlight the need to assess MLLMs' context-dependent visual comprehension, which is important for real-world reliability.
- Introduce CODIS benchmark to test this ability using carefully constructed ambiguous images paired with subtly different contexts.
- Evaluation of 14 MLLMs shows significant gaps from human performance, indicating difficulties in extracting and utilizing contextual information.
- The new benchmark provides a way to measure and improve context-dependent visual understanding in MLLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new benchmark called CODIS to evaluate context-dependent image disambiguation abilities of multimodal models. What are some key advantages of this benchmark compared to previous benchmarks like VisDial and MMDialog that also use contextual information?

2. The taxonomy categorizes context into 5 types - location & orientation, temporal, cultural, attributes, and relationships. Can you think of any other important categories of context that could be added to this taxonomy to make it more comprehensive? 

3. The paper uses pairwise accuracy and query-wise accuracy as evaluation metrics. What are the pros and cons of these metrics? Could any other metrics be used instead to better evaluate model performance?

4. Human performance on CODIS is not 100%. What are some potential reasons for humans struggling with certain questions as discussed? How can the benchmark be improved to reduce ambiguity and difficulty?

5. The analysis shows models struggle to effectively utilize context information. What specific deficiencies do models exhibit in extracting and applying context based on the experiments and analysis done in the paper?

6. Bias in model outputs is identified as one reason for poor context utilization. What is the evidence for this? How exactly does the pairwise data design help mitigate bias?

7. Scaling model size from ~7B to ~13B parameters did not consistently improve scores. What hypotheses are provided for why performance did not necessarily improve with scale? How can this be rigorously tested?

8. Replacing images with captions improved accuracy for models. What does this indicate about deficiencies in visual feature extraction and context-dependent comprehension of images?

9. The high human-GPT4 agreement shows promise for automated evaluation. But what are limitations of full automation? When is human evaluation still critical?

10. What enhancements to model architecture, objectives, or training data could better equip models for context-dependent visual understanding based on the analyses?
