# [Identifying Climate Targets in National Laws and Policies using Machine   Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02822)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quantified policy targets (e.g. emissions reductions by a certain date) are a critical part of climate policy, but manually extracting them from laws and policies is laborious. 
- This limits the ability of policymakers and researchers to assess alignment with global climate goals and make informed policy decisions.
- There is a need for scalable methods to extract climate targets from national laws and policies.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a machine learning approach to automatically identify and extract different types of climate targets from text.
- Create an expert-annotated dataset labeling target types: Net Zero, Emissions Reductions, and Other (e.g. renewable energy targets).
- Train a multi-label text classifier on this dataset to identify target mentions in laws and policies.
- Apply the model to a large database of global climate laws and policies to enable analysis.

Key Contributions:
- New multi-label dataset labeling target types in climate policy documents.
- Classifier with 0.849 F1 score for identifying three target types.
- Analysis of potential model biases related to country names and round target years.
- Demonstration of using model predictions to analyze targets, e.g. linking sectors to target types.
- This work enables more effective analysis of climate policy targets and commitments for researchers and policymakers.

In summary, the paper presents a machine learning solution to automatically extract different types of climate targets from text to support analysis and improve climate policy development globally. The model and dataset enable more scalable understanding of climate commitments for decision makers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an approach for extracting mentions of quantified emissions reduction, net-zero, and other climate-related targets from national laws and policies using machine learning, and analyzes the potential applications and biases of the method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is presenting an approach for extracting mentions of targets from national climate laws and policies, using paragraph-level classification. Specifically, the authors:

1) Create an expert-annotated dataset identifying three categories of targets ('Net Zero', 'Reduction' and 'Other') and train a classifier to reliably identify them in text. 

2) Investigate bias and equity impacts related to their model, identifying specific years and country names as problematic features. 

3) Apply the model to a large dataset of global national climate laws, policies and UNFCCC submissions to demonstrate its potential for supporting climate policy analysis and automated data collection for existing climate policy databases. 

So in summary, the main contribution is developing a machine learning model to extract different types of climate targets from policy documents, demonstrating how this can enable more detailed and scalable analysis of national climate commitments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Climate targets - The paper focuses on identifying and extracting mentions of climate targets from national laws and policies. This includes targets like net-zero, emissions reductions, and other quantified climate goals.

- Machine learning - The authors develop a machine learning approach, specifically a text classification model, to identify climate targets in policy documents.

- Natural language processing (NLP) - NLP techniques are used to analyze the text of laws and policies and identify target mentions. This includes using transformer models like RoBERTa and ClimateBERT.

- Bias and equity - The authors analyze bias and equity impacts related to the model, like biases toward certain countries or round target years. 

- Climate policy - The overall goal is to better analyze national climate laws and policies to support policymaking and research. Identifying targets is seen as a key capability.

- Paris Agreement - The paper discusses climate targets in the context of the Paris Agreement and nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

- Topic modeling - Topic modeling is used to analyze the types of "Other" non-emissions reduction targets identified by the model.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new "Other" category of targets. What is the motivation behind introducing this new category? How does it extend prior work on identifying climate targets?

2. The paper uses multi-label classification to accommodate significant overlap across target categories. What are the advantages of using multi-label classification compared to single-label classification for this task? How does it enable more nuanced analysis of climate targets?

3. Stratified sampling is used to oversample underrepresented regions and machine translated documents. What potential issues could arise if stratified sampling was not used? How does it help mitigate equity and bias concerns? 

4. The paper analyzes lower model performance on machine translated text. What factors could contribute to this lower performance? How can the model be improved to better handle machine translated data?

5. The paper identifies biases in the model towards certain country names and round year values. Why do these biases occur and how can they be mitigated? What steps were taken in the paper to analyze model biases?

6. Topic modeling is applied to paragraphs predicted as the "Other" target type. What additional insights does the topic modeling provide compared to only having target type predictions? How does it demonstrate the utility of the model?

7. How was inter-annotator agreement measured during the annotation process? What was the agreement level and why is this important to report?

8. Active learning is employed to sample additional training examples. How does active learning complement the initial stratified sampling? What are its advantages over passive learning?

9. The paper analyzes an "implementation gap" between government climate commitments and actual policy targets. Why is this analysis valuable? How does the model enable this analysis that was previously difficult?

10. What opportunities exist for future work and applications using the model presented in this paper? What notable limitations still exist in extracting structured climate target information?
