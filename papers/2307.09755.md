# [Space Engage: Collaborative Space Supervision for Contrastive-based   Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09755)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we enhance semi-supervised semantic segmentation by better utilizing information from both the logit space (output space) and representation space (feature space) in a collaborative manner?Specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:1) Using pseudo-labels from both logit space and representation space collaboratively (via mix or cross pseudo-labeling) can provide more reliable supervision during unlabeled training compared to using pseudo-labels from just one space. 2) Using an indicator based on similarity to prototypes in representation space, rather than just confidence from logit space, can better identify critical/confusing samples and lead to more effective representation learning.3) The proposed collaborative supervision between logit and representation spaces can improve knowledge exchange and consistency between the two, leading to better performance.So in summary, the central focus is on exploring how to effectively combine information from output space and feature space in a collaborative way to boost semi-supervised semantic segmentation performance. The key ideas are dual-space pseudo-labeling strategies and using similarity as an indicator for representation learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing collaborative pseudo-labeling strategies to enhance knowledge exchange between the logit and representation spaces for contrastive-based semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4). Specifically, the paper utilizes pseudo-labels from both the logit space and representation space to obtain more reliable supervision during unlabeled training. Two strategies are introduced - a mix pseudo-labeling strategy that combines agreeable pseudo-labels, and a cross pseudo-labeling strategy that leverages pseudo-labels from one space to supervise the other. 2. Employing a new indicator, based on similarity between representations and prototypes, to guide the learning process in the representation space. This similarity indicator directly reflects the confusion level and helps identify critical samples for effective contrastive learning. 3. Conducting extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets that demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods. The ablations also validate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative pseudo-labeling strategies and similarity indicator.In summary, the key innovation seems to be in exploiting supervision signals from both logit and representation spaces in a collaborative manner, and using a more effective similarity indicator, to enhance contrastive-based semi-supervised learning for semantic segmentation. The dual-space collaboration and use of similarity appear to be the main novel contributions.
