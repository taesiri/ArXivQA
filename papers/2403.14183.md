# [OTSeg: Multi-prompt Sinkhorn Attention for Zero-Shot Semantic   Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14183)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3) aims to segment both seen and unseen classes without pixel annotations of unseen classes. 
- Leveraging vision-language models (VLM) like CLIP has shown promising results for ZS3. However, directly transferring the pre-trained knowledge of VLMs to pixel-level prediction is challenging as they are not optimized for dense alignment.  
- Existing approaches that introduce multiple text prompts to guide the segmentation still have limitations as the text prompts are passively aligned with image pixels.

Proposed Solution - OTSeg:
- Proposes a novel optimal transport (OT) based attention mechanism called Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn Attention (MPSA) to enhance alignment between multiple text prompts and image pixels.
- First proposes Multi-Prompts Sinkhorn (MPS) to transport distributions of multiple text prompts to the pixel distribution using Sinkhorn algorithm. This refines the text-pixel score maps.
- Then proposes MPSA that replaces the Softmax normalization of cross-attention in decoders with MPS for optimal text-pixel alignment.  

Main Contributions:
- Introduces MPS and MPSA for improved multimodal alignment using optimal transport of multiple text prompts.
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on ZS3 tasks across VOC 2012, PASCAL Context and COCO-Stuff164K datasets.
- Demonstrates superior generalization capability in both inductive and transductive settings as well as cross-dataset experiments.
- Proposes an effective ensemble strategy to combine predictions from both decoder output and refined score maps.

In summary, the paper presents a novel optimal transformer framework called OTSeg that leverages multiple text prompts to achieve enhanced alignment for advancing zero-shot semantic segmentation.
