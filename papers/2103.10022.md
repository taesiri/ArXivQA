# Generating Diverse Structure for Image Inpainting With Hierarchical   VQ-VAE

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an image inpainting method that generates diverse and high-quality results?The key points are:- Image inpainting is an ill-posed problem with multiple plausible solutions for a given incomplete image. - Existing single-solution inpainting methods can generate visually realistic results, but only produce one solution. - Existing multiple-solution inpainting methods show diversity, but often have poor quality outputs with distorted structures and blurry textures.- This paper proposes a new multiple-solution inpainting method to enhance both diversity and visual quality. - The method is based on a hierarchical VQ-VAE model that disentangles structural and textural image features. - A two-stage approach is used: first generate diverse structures by sampling from a learned conditional distribution, then generate textures guided by the sampled structures.- Novel components are proposed for texture generation, including a structural attention module and two feature losses.- Experiments demonstrate improved performance over prior methods in generating diverse, structurally coherent, and visually realistic inpainting results.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by disentangling structure and texture and generating them separately, the proposed two-stage approach can produce higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper proposes a new method for multiple-solution image inpainting using a hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). 2. The method splits the inpainting task into two stages: diverse structure generation and texture generation. 3. For diverse structure generation, the method uses an autoregressive network to model a conditional distribution over discrete structural features extracted by the VQ-VAE. Sampling from this distribution generates diverse structures.4. For texture generation, the method proposes a structural attention module to ensure consistency between generated textures and structures. It also proposes two novel feature losses calculated using the VQ-VAE encoder to improve structure and texture quality.5. Experiments show the method generates higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior multiple-solution methods. The VQ-VAE representation is shown to be beneficial for disentangling and generating structures and textures.In summary, the key ideas are using a VQ-VAE to extract discrete structural and textural features, modeling structures via an autoregressive distribution, and ensuring texture-structure consistency via a novel attention module and feature losses. This approach is shown to enhance both quality and diversity for multiple-solution inpainting.
