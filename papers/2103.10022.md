# [Generating Diverse Structure for Image Inpainting With Hierarchical   VQ-VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10022)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an image inpainting method that generates diverse and high-quality results?The key points are:- Image inpainting is an ill-posed problem with multiple plausible solutions for a given incomplete image. - Existing single-solution inpainting methods can generate visually realistic results, but only produce one solution. - Existing multiple-solution inpainting methods show diversity, but often have poor quality outputs with distorted structures and blurry textures.- This paper proposes a new multiple-solution inpainting method to enhance both diversity and visual quality. - The method is based on a hierarchical VQ-VAE model that disentangles structural and textural image features. - A two-stage approach is used: first generate diverse structures by sampling from a learned conditional distribution, then generate textures guided by the sampled structures.- Novel components are proposed for texture generation, including a structural attention module and two feature losses.- Experiments demonstrate improved performance over prior methods in generating diverse, structurally coherent, and visually realistic inpainting results.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by disentangling structure and texture and generating them separately, the proposed two-stage approach can produce higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper proposes a new method for multiple-solution image inpainting using a hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). 2. The method splits the inpainting task into two stages: diverse structure generation and texture generation. 3. For diverse structure generation, the method uses an autoregressive network to model a conditional distribution over discrete structural features extracted by the VQ-VAE. Sampling from this distribution generates diverse structures.4. For texture generation, the method proposes a structural attention module to ensure consistency between generated textures and structures. It also proposes two novel feature losses calculated using the VQ-VAE encoder to improve structure and texture quality.5. Experiments show the method generates higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior multiple-solution methods. The VQ-VAE representation is shown to be beneficial for disentangling and generating structures and textures.In summary, the key ideas are using a VQ-VAE to extract discrete structural and textural features, modeling structures via an autoregressive distribution, and ensuring texture-structure consistency via a novel attention module and feature losses. This approach is shown to enhance both quality and diversity for multiple-solution inpainting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage image inpainting method that first generates diverse coarse structures by sampling from a learned conditional autoregressive distribution over discrete latent variables, then refines each structure separately using a texture generator with a novel structural attention module and feature losses.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of image inpainting:- This paper focuses on generating multiple plausible solutions for image inpainting, unlike most prior work that produces a single output. The idea of generating diverse outputs is an interesting direction for inpainting research.- The method uses a hierarchical VQ-VAE model to disentangle structural and textural image features. This is a novel application of VQ-VAEs. Most prior inpainting work uses other types of models like GANs or convolutional networks. Using a VQ-VAE to separate structure and texture is clever.- The two-stage model architecture of separate structure generation and texture generation is different from previous approaches. Prior methods usually integrate both structure and texture together in a single network. Splitting them makes the diversity modeling cleaner.- Modeling the structure distribution with an autoregressive network allows exact likelihood training. This is more principled than approaches based on continuous latent spaces and approximations like VAEs. The discrete latent space also avoids posterior collapse issues that affect other latent variable models.- The proposed structural attention module provides long-range guidance for texture generation based directly on structure. This is a smart way to correlate structure and texture. Most methods use attention on learned feature maps which is less directly coupled.- The use of VQ losses for structure and texture are novel auxiliary losses compared to standard perceptual losses. Re-using the VQ-VAE encoder is clever.Overall, the method explores some interesting ideas like hierarchical disentangling of structure/texture, autoregressive structure modeling, and structure-based attention and losses. The experiments show advantages over previous approaches in quality and diversity. This is a solid contribution advancing the state-of-the-art in diverse image inpainting.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Extending the method to other conditional image generation tasks like style transfer, image super-resolution, and guided editing. The authors mention they plan to apply their hierarchical VQ-VAE model and two-stage inpainting approach to other image generation problems.- Using a more complex autoregressive network for the structure generator. The authors used a lightweight network for efficiency, but mention a more complex network like in the original VQ-VAE paper could improve result quality.- Improving the texture generator by integrating techniques from recent single-solution inpainting methods, like feature discriminators, multi-scale generators/discriminators, etc. This could help reduce artifacts.- Studying the theoretical quality-diversity tradeoff in inpainting. The authors discuss how there may be an inherent tradeoff between diversity and quality that could be interesting to analyze further.- Increasing diversity by using a larger training dataset, more random masks, regularizing the learned distribution, etc. The diversity is determined by the learned conditional distribution.- Investigating parallel decoding techniques for the autoregressive network to reduce sampling time. The sequential sampling process is slow.- Applying the method to higher resolutions by increasing the capacity of the hierarchical VQ-VAE model.So in summary, the main suggested future work relates to extending the approach to other tasks, improving the quality and diversity further, reducing the sampling time, and analyzing the theoretical tradeoffs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a two-stage model for generating diverse and high-quality image inpainting results using a hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE-2). The model first uses the encoder of a pre-trained VQ-VAE-2 to disentangle an image's structural and textural features. An autoregressive network then models a conditional distribution over the discrete structural features and samples from it to generate diverse structures. Next, a texture generator network takes the generated structural features as input and produces a complete image. To ensure consistency between textures and structures, a structural attention module is proposed that attends to generated structural features. Two novel feature losses computed using the VQ-VAE-2 encoder further improve structural coherence and textural realism. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the method's ability to generate multiple inpainting solutions with higher quality and diversity compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. Key advantages are the modeling of discrete latent features to avoid posterior collapse, explicit disentangling and generation of structural features, and reuse of the VQ-VAE-2 encoder to enable feature losses.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a multiple-solution image inpainting method based on a hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) model. The hierarchical encoder and decoder of VQ-VAE disentangle the structural and textural information of an image into discrete latent variables. Based on these learned features, a two-stage model is proposed that splits image inpainting into diverse structure generation and texture generation. In the first stage, an autoregressive network utilizes the incomplete image to formulate a conditional distribution over the discrete structural features. Sampling from this distribution generates diverse structure features. In the second stage, a GAN-based texture generator uses the sampled structural features to synthesize image details. To ensure consistency between texture and structure, a structural attention module is proposed to capture long-range correlations using the structural features. Furthermore, the pre-trained VQ-VAE encoder is reused to define two novel losses that improve structure coherence and texture realism. Experiments on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the proposed method generates higher quality and more diverse inpainting results compared to prior single-solution and multiple-solution methods. The discrete latent space and explicit structure generation avoid the posterior collapse issue faced by previous VAE-based inpainting methods. The structural attention module and feature losses further enhance visual quality. Both qualitative and quantitative results validate the superiority of the proposed approach for diverse and realistic image inpainting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes a two-stage model for diverse image inpainting based on a hierarchical vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). In the first stage, the encoder of the pre-trained VQ-VAE is used to extract discrete structural and textural features from images. An autoregressive network is then trained to model the conditional distribution over the structural features given an incomplete input image. Sampling from this distribution generates diverse structural features. In the second stage, a GAN-based texture generator network synthesizes the image textures guided by the generated structural features. To ensure consistency between textures and structures, a structural attention module is proposed to capture long-range correlations using the structural features. In addition, two novel feature losses computed using the VQ-VAE encoder improve the coherence of generated structures and realism of synthesized textures. The method splits inpainting into explicit structure generation and texture synthesis stages, with the goal of producing diverse yet high-quality image completions.
