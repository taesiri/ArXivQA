## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising research directions for pre-training methods in information retrieval:

1. Designing new pre-training objectives and architectures tailored for IR tasks. This includes exploring new self-supervised objectives that better resemble IR tasks like relevance matching, as well as new model architectures that are suitable for handling long documents.

2. Utilizing multi-source heterogeneous data for pre-training, including multi-lingual data, multi-modal data (text, images, etc.), and knowledge graphs. Incorporating these diverse data sources has great potential to enhance document representations. 

3. Exploring end-to-end learning of IR systems based on pre-trained models, rather than separating indexing, retrieval, and ranking steps. Joint training could lead to better overall performance.

4. Moving towards next-generation "model-centric" IR systems built entirely around pre-trained models, rather than traditional inverted index-based systems. The models would embed indexing and retrieval within themselves.

5. Addressing challenges like limited reasoning skills and interpretability of large pre-trained models before they can be deployed in real-world IR systems.

In summary, the main future directions are developing pre-training techniques tailored for IR, incorporating diverse data sources, enabling end-to-end joint learning, and ultimately rethinking IR systems around pre-trained models. There are still many open challenges to realize this vision fully.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel pre-training method called Representative wOrds Prediction (ROP) tailored for ad-hoc retrieval. The key idea is to leverage the query likelihood principle from statistical language models that assumes a query is a piece of text representative of the ideal relevant document. Based on this, the ROP pre-training task constructs training samples by sampling two sets of words from the vocabulary according to the unigram language model. One set contains more representative words of the document collection while the other set is more random. The pre-training model is then trained to predict which set is more representative given the two sets of words. In this way, the model is expected to learn good query and document representations that can capture their relevance relationship. After pre-training with the ROP task, the model can be fine-tuned on downstream ad-hoc retrieval datasets. Experiments show that ROP significantly outperforms strong baselines like BERT and other IR-specific pre-training methods. It also demonstrates surprising zero-shot performance on some datasets without any fine-tuning.
