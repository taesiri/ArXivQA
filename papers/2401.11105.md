# [Are Latent Vulnerabilities Hidden Gems for Software Vulnerability   Prediction? An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Software vulnerabilities (SVs) pose significant security risks to software systems. Most existing SV datasets rely on vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) to label vulnerable code, but do not consider latent SVs that exist between the introduction and fix of an SV. Little is known about the prevalence and usefulness of these latent SVs for enhancing SV prediction models.

Solution:
The paper conducts an empirical study on 100k+ latent vulnerable functions identified using the V-SZZ algorithm from two widely-used SV datasets - BigVul and Devign. The study analyzes the quality, prevalence and impact of incorporating these latent SVs on state-of-the-art function-level and line-level SV prediction models.  

Key Findings:
- Latent SVs have ~6% noise but 90% of them are missing in current datasets. They can increase SV data size by 4x and correct 5k mislabeled functions.

- Incorporating latent SVs into function-level SV prediction boosts performance by up to 24.5% in F1-score and 69% in recall compared to baselines, owing to more diverse SV patterns. Noise reduction discards many true positives.

- For line-level prediction, latent SVs enhance accuracy by up to 5.5% and cost-effectiveness by up to 67%. Line rankings improve but top-ranked lines do not always exist in latent SVs.

- Latent SVs are more beneficial for projects with fewer original SVs by providing more SV diversity. Trained models can detect latent SVs without VFCs with ~80% recall.

Main Contributions:
- First study uncovering, characterizing and demonstrating the value of latent SVs for enhancing SV datasets and prediction models
- Analysis of quality, prevalence and impact of 100k+ latent vulnerable functions
- Empirical evidence of significant improvements in function-level (24.5% F1) and line-level (67% cost-effectiveness) SV prediction
- Actionable guidelines for effective use of latent SVs to advance security analytics tasks

In summary, the paper provides the first promising step towards leveraging latent vulnerable functions as a convenient, scalable and low-cost technique to improve real-world SV management.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper empirically studies the quality, prevalence, and impact of latent software vulnerabilities uncovered using the SZZ algorithm on improving vulnerability prediction models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors uncover and characterize latent vulnerable functions in current SV datasets based on the latest SZZ algorithm. They show that 90% of these latent SVs are missing in the datasets and they can correct up to 5k vulnerable functions mislabeled as non-vulnerable. Yet, around 6% of these latent SVs are noisy.

2. The authors demonstrate the positive impacts of using SZZ-based latent SVs in the studied datasets for SV prediction. They observe a rise of up to 24.5% in F1-Score for function-level SV prediction and an effectiveness increase of up to 67% for line-level SV prediction. The models with SZZ-based latent SVs can also identify up to 80% of latent SVs that cannot be extracted based on SZZ outputs, around 2.5x better than the baseline models without latent SVs.

3. The authors share their data and code for future research.

In summary, the main contribution is uncovering and analyzing the quality and prevalence of latent vulnerable functions, and demonstrating their ability to significantly improve software vulnerability prediction when incorporated into existing datasets and models.

The paper focuses on studying latent vulnerabilities in existing software vulnerability datasets like Devign and BigVul using the V-SZZ algorithm. It evaluates the quality and prevalence of these latent vulnerabilities. The paper also examines the impact of incorporating these latent vulnerabilities on improving vulnerability prediction performance at both the function-level and line-level using deep learning models like LineVul. Different noise reduction techniques are explored to handle the noise in the latent vulnerabilities. So these are some of the key terms and topics central to this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper relies on the V-SZZ algorithm to identify latent vulnerable functions. What are the key enhancements of V-SZZ over prior SZZ variants, and how do they help improve the accuracy of uncovering latent vulnerable functions?

2. The paper finds two main noise patterns in the identified latent vulnerable functions - incorrect line mapping and changed code context. Can you further explain these noise sources and why they make accurate identification of latent vulnerabilities challenging? 

3. The Latest Introducing Commit (LIC) technique is used as one of the noise reduction methods for latent vulnerable functions. Explain the intuition behind using functions after the latest introducing commit and how this method tackles the incorrect line mapping noise.

4. Self-training (ST) is a commonly used semi-supervised technique. Explain how self-training is adapted in this study to reduce noise in latent vulnerable functions. What are its limitations?

5. Centroid-based removal (CR) has been applied in prior work for noise detection. Elaborate on how CR is customized to identify and remove noisy latent vulnerable functions in this study. What kind of latent functions would CR likely incorrectly discard?

6. The paper shows superior performance of noise-aware models over noise-unaware ones. However, even the best noise-reduction technique discards 31% of true positive latent functions. Analyze the root causes of this issue and potential solutions.  

7. The improvements in SV prediction are contributed more by the additional vulnerable functions rather than the corrected mislabeled ones. Justify whether this outcome aligns with the data statistics reported in Table 3.

8. Explain why latent vulnerable functions lead to higher improvements for projects with fewer original vulnerabilities. What are the practical implications? 

9. Models incorporating latent vulnerabilities can detect new latent functions not extractable with V-SZZ. Analyze the differences in detection recall between the Devign and BigVul datasets. What can explain the lower recall for BigVul?

10. The paper only considers latent vulnerable functions. Discuss the challenges and feasibility of identifying latent non-vulnerable functions to further expand SV datasets.
