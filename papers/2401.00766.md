# [Bracketing is All You Need: Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement   Tasks with Multi-Exposure Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00766)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Capturing high-quality images in low-light conditions is challenging due to issues like noise, blur, limited dynamic range, and low resolution.  
- Existing methods focus on specific image restoration (denoising, deblurring, super-resolution) or enhancement (HDR imaging) tasks separately. They are insufficient to obtain visually appealing nighttime photos.
- Multi-image settings like burst, dual-exposure have made progress but still face issues:
    - Burst images have limited dynamic range for effective HDR reconstruction
    - Dual-exposure methods rarely combine with HDR imaging
    
Solution - BracketIRE:
- Leverage bracketing photography with multi-exposure images to unify image restoration and enhancement
- Multi-exposure images have complementary characteristics to assist in denoising, deblurring, HDR imaging, and super-resolution
- Two solutions proposed:
    - BracketIRE: Integrates denoising, deblurring, HDR reconstruction
    - BracketIRE+: Additional super-resolution on top of BracketIRE
    
Key Methods:
- Difficult to collect real-world paired training data
- Two-step approach:  
    1) Pre-train on synthetic paired data  
    2) Self-supervised adaptation on real-world images
- Temporally Modulated Recurrent Network (TMRNet) 
    - Frame-specific parameters to handle varying degradations  
    - Parameters shared across frames may limit performance
- Self-Supervised Adaptation
    - Losses designed using temporal characteristics of multi-exposure images
    - Alleviate gap between synthetic data and real-world images
    
Contributions:
- Unify image restoration and enhancement using bracketing photography 
- TMRNet and self-supervision adaptation method
- Synthetic data simulation pipeline and real-world multi-exposure nighttime dataset
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance compared to multi-image processing methods
