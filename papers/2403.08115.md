# [Legally Binding but Unfair? Towards Assessing Fairness of Privacy   Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Privacy policies are expected to inform data subjects about their data protection rights in a fair way. However, assessing the fairness of privacy policies has not been well studied. 

- The paper identifies three important dimensions of fairness that should be assessed in privacy policies: informational fairness (readability, complexity), representational fairness (avoiding bias against groups), and ethics/morality (avoiding harm, balancing interests fairly).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper surveys definitions of fairness and related NLP methods for assessing text on these three dimensions. 

- It proposes approaches to automatically evaluate privacy policies, including readability metrics, bias metrics using word embeddings, andLARGE language models for making ethical judgements.

- Preliminary experiments are conducted on German privacy policies to demonstrate the feasibility of assessing fairness issues with these methods.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies assessing fairness of privacy policies as an open research problem with social importance.

- Proposes a conceptual framework to assess informational, representational, and ethical fairness of privacy policies based on literature.

- Suggests computational methods adapted from NLP and linguistics to implement assessments automatically.

- Provides evidence from preliminary experiments that fairness issues can be detected with these methods.

- Discusses use cases and applications for improving fairness and transparency of privacy policies.

The paper makes an important first step towards assessing and improving the fairness of privacy policies using NLP. Key next steps are holistic implementation and evaluation of the proposed assessment procedures with experts.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an approach to automatically assess the informational fairness, representational fairness, and ethics/morality of privacy policies using text statistics, linguistic methods, and artificial intelligence.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors propose an approach based on readability metrics, lexical filtering, and large language models to assess three dimensions of fairness in privacy policies - informational fairness, representational fairness, and ethics/morality. They conduct preliminary experiments on real-world privacy policies from German websites to provide evidence that their approach can automatically assess fairness issues in privacy policies. This is the first work to suggest an approach for investigating the fairness of privacy policies.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an automated approach to assess multiple dimensions of fairness in privacy policies, including preliminary experiments that demonstrate the viability of their approach. This sets the foundation for improving transparency and avoiding discrimination or unethical practices in privacy policies.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Fairness
- Privacy policies
- Informational fairness
- Representational fairness 
- Ethics and morality
- Natural language processing
- Readability metrics
- Bias metrics
- Morality classification
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Discrimination

- Large language models (LLMs)

The paper proposes an approach to automatically assess the fairness of privacy policies along three dimensions - informational fairness, representational fairness, and ethics/morality. It utilizes natural language processing methods like readability metrics, bias metrics, and morality classification with large language models to evaluate these aspects. The approach is aimed at improving transparency, avoiding discrimination, and identifying potentially unethical practices in privacy policies. The legal basis stems from principles of fairness and non-discrimination in human rights declarations and the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Preliminary experiments on German privacy policies provide evidence that the proposed approach can automatically uncover issues in all three fairness dimensions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper for assessing the fairness of privacy policies:

1. The paper proposes assessing informational fairness through metrics like readability, coherence, and document structure inclusiveness. However, how can cultural differences in writing styles and expectations be accounted for? Some cultures prefer more indirect communication while others are more direct.

2. For representational fairness, the paper suggests carefully selecting and translating existing descriptor terms or using an LLM to generate them. But how can we ensure the descriptor terms themselves are free of biases and accurately reflect the nuances of different demographic groups? 

3. The paper uses an LLM for assessing ethics and morality of privacy policies. But how do we ensure the training data and algorithms of the LLM itself are free of biases? How can the subjectivity inherent in making ethical judgments be accounted for?

4. The preliminary experiments in the paper provide initial evidence of issues in the three fairness dimensions. However, what further experiments are needed to more conclusively validate the ability of this method to uncover different kinds of fairness issues? 

5. The paper focuses on privacy policies in German. What adaptations would be needed to assess privacy policies in other languages? How can cultural differences in norms and values be accounted for when assessing fairness?

6. The paper does not consider intersectionality in its assessment of fairness issues. However, individuals often face compound discrimination due to their membership in multiple marginalized groups. How can an intersectional perspective be incorporated?

7. What mechanisms can be incorporated in this method to weigh different kinds of fairness issues against each other, especially when they seem contradictory? For example, simplifying language to enhance readability versus using precise legal language.

8. The paper does not assess distributive fairness issues in detail. However, privacy policies may still treat some groups of users differently. How can distributive fairness regarding data practices also be evaluated?

9. The paper proposes applications in analyses and writing support tools. However, what other potential applications can this method enable to concretely address and enhance fairness in privacy policies?

10. The paper focuses on textual analysis of privacy policies. However, other modalities like videos or podcasts explain policies too nowadays. How can multimodal fairness analysis of privacy policies be enabled through extensions of this method?
