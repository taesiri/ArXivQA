# [USE: Dynamic User Modeling with Stateful Sequence Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13344)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and personalized services. 
- Recent advances use sequence models to learn user embeddings from behavioral data.
- However, behavior-based user embedding learning faces the challenge of dynamic user modeling, where user behaviors continuously expand over time. 
- Existing methods rely on stateless models like Transformers, which either discard historical data or have to recompute embeddings from scratch each time. This is inefficient and loses valuable information.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose USE (User Stateful Embeddings), which generates user embeddings that evolve with user behaviors without exhaustive reprocessing. 
- USE is based on the Retentive Network, which enables stateful recurrent inference. By storing previous model states, it can efficiently incorporate new user behaviors.
- Two novel pre-training objectives are introduced:
   - Future W-Behavior Prediction: Predicts user's future behaviors in a window to focus on longer-term interests.
   - Same User Prediction: Contrastive loss to make embeddings distinguishable between users.

Main Contributions:
- Concept of stateful user modeling to efficiently update embeddings as new user behaviors come in.
- Architecture based on Retentive Networks to enable statefulness.
- Future W-Behavior Prediction objective to model longer-term user interests. 
- Same User Prediction objective for more distinctive embeddings.
- Extensive experiments on 8 tasks with Snapchat data showing USE's superiority over baselines in both static and dynamic settings. Efficiently integrates historical and recent user behaviors without sacrificing effectiveness.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient stateful user embedding method to overcome limitations of previous stateless models in dynamic behavior-based user modeling.
