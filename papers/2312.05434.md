# [Beneath the Surface: Unveiling Harmful Memes with Multimodal Reasoning   Distilled from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05434)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
- Harmful memes that promote hate or discrimination are prevalent online, but detecting them is challenging due to the implicit meaning conveyed through the combination of text and images.  
- Existing detection methods rely on superficial signals and do not properly understand the interplay between modalities.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct abductive reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to generate rationales explaining judgments on meme harmfulness.
- Propose a generative framework with two stages:
   1) Reasoning distillation: Fine-tune a smaller LM to distill reasoning knowledge from the LLM rationales and fuse text/image features.
   2) Harmfulness inference: Further fine-tune the model to predict meme harmfulness.

Key Contributions:  
- First work to address the lack of in-depth understanding in harmful meme detection by harnessing commonsense knowledge from advanced LLMs.
- Novel two-stage training approach to inject multimodal reasoning into smaller LMs for better fusion and lightweight fine-tuning.  
- Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public meme datasets, outperforming competitive baselines.
- Provides analysis of model rationales to showcase its reasoning process in judging meme harmfulness.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel perspective of utilizing LLMs' reasoning capacity to unveil the meaning behind superficial signals in harmful memes. The proposed two-stage generative model infused with such reasoning knowledge reaches superior detection performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called Mr.Harm that uses multimodal reasoning knowledge distilled from large language models to detect harmful memes by understanding the implicit meaning conveyed through the combination of text and images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are summarized in three folds:

1. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first to alleviate the issue of superficial understanding for harmful meme detection by explicitly utilizing commonsense knowledge, from a fresh perspective on harnessing advanced large language models (LLMs).

2. The paper proposes a novel generative framework to fine-tune smaller language models augmented with the multimodal reasoning knowledge distilled from LLMs. This framework consists of two training stages - reasoning distillation and harmfulness inference - to facilitate better multimodal fusion and lightweight fine-tuning for harmfulness prediction.

3. Extensive experiments conducted on three meme datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach, Mr.Harm, achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on the harmful meme detection task.

In summary, the key contribution is using knowledge distillation from LLMs to inject multimodal reasoning ability into a smaller network for better understanding and detection of harmful memes. The proposed two-stage training paradigm and evaluations confirm the effectiveness of this idea.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this work include:

- Harmful memes - The paper focuses on detecting harmful memes, which are defined as multimodal units with text and images that can cause harm to individuals or society. 

- Multimodal reasoning - A core idea in the paper is using multimodal reasoning, meaning reasoning over the interplay between the textual and visual elements of memes, to better detect harm.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The approach relies on first conducting abductive reasoning using large pre-trained language models to generate rationales that capture the implicit meanings in memes.

- Knowledge distillation - The rationales from the LLMs are then used to distill multimodal reasoning knowledge into a smaller generative framework consisting of a fine-tuned language model.

- Two-stage training - The overall framework uses a two-stage training process, first distilling knowledge from LLMs, then fine-tuning for the end task of harmfulness prediction.

- Textual features - The model encodes textual features from the meme text. 

- Visual features - The model also encodes and incorporates visual features from the meme's image.

- Multimodal fusion - An attention-based fusion mechanism is used to enable interactions between textual and visual representations.

In summary, the key ideas focus on using explicit multimodal reasoning distilled from large language models to better understand the often implicit meanings in harmful memes for more reliable detection.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes to use abductive reasoning with large language models (LLMs) first. What are the benefits of using abductive reasoning compared to inductive or deductive reasoning in this context? How does it help with the reasoning process?

2. The paper extracts image captions using an off-the-shelf model and uses that as input to the LLM prompt. What are the potential limitations of using just the caption vs using the full image? Could the caption miss or misrepresent key visual elements?  

3. The paper proposes a two-stage training approach. What is the intuition behind separating into a reasoning distillation stage and a harmfulness inference stage? Why is a two-stage approach better than end-to-end or one-stage training?

4. How exactly does the cross-attention mechanism between text and image features allow for better context understanding and multimodal reasoning? Can you explain the dynamics of how it enables semantic alignment?

5. Could you analyze the error cases provided in Figure 5? What background knowledge or reasoning capability is the model still lacking that could be improved?

6. The paper shows human-readable intermediate rationales generated by the model. Do you think this increases model interpretability and explainability? How could the rationales be evaluated systematically?

7. The model seems to perform better on more challenging datasets like Harm-C and FHM. Why might this be the case? What properties of those datasets enable the reasoning ability of the model to shine through?  

8. How do you think the model could be adapted or improved to detect more implicit types of harmful memes where the harm is very subtle? Would the current approach fail in those cases?

9. The model incorporates commonsense knowledge and background context related to the memes. Do you think this knowledge transfer was effective? How could the commonsense reasoning capability be improved further?

10. The paper claims to unveil harmful meaning beneath the meme surface - do you think this claim is valid? What further analysis could substantiate whether implicit meaning is correctly identified rather than superficial signals?
