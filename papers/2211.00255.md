# CARE: Causality Reasoning for Empathetic Responses by Conditional Graph   Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How to improve empathetic response generation in dialog systems through better comprehension of the user's feelings and experiences? Specifically, the authors identify two main issues with current approaches:1) They only consider causalities between the user's emotion and experiences, while ignoring causalities among the experiences themselves. 2) They reason about causalities independently, without considering interdependencies.To address these issues, the paper proposes a new model called CARE that:1) Reasons about all plausible causalities (not just emotion-related ones) in an interdependent, simultaneous manner using a novel Conditional Variational Graph Autoencoder (CVGAE). 2) Infuses the reasoned causalities into the response generation process through a multi-source attention mechanism.The overall goal is to improve the system's understanding of the user's feelings and situations, in order to generate more empathetic responses. Experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the proposed CARE model in generating empathetic responses.In summary, the central hypothesis is that reasoning about causalities in an interdependent, holistic manner and infusing that into response generation will lead to more empathetic dialog systems. The CARE model is proposed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing to reason all plausible causalities in empathetic conversation interdependently and simultaneously for a deeper understanding of the user's feelings and experiences. 2. Turning causality reasoning into a conditional graph generation task, and introducing a Conditional Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (CVGAE) to achieve the reasoning. CVGAE uses latent variables for conditional structure prediction.3. Designing CARE, a model which incorporates causality reasoning with CVGAE into empathetic response generation. Experiments show CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EmpatheticDialogues benchmark.In summary, the key contribution is using conditional graph generation with CVGAE to perform more comprehensive and interdependent causality reasoning, in order to improve empathetic response generation. The proposed CARE model integrates this reasoning into a transformer-based response generation framework and demonstrates strong results.
