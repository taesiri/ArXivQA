# [Deep Learning-Based Speech and Vision Synthesis to Improve Phishing   Attack Detection through a Multi-layer Adaptive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing anti-phishing methods are vulnerable to complex and increasingly sophisticated phishing attacks that use techniques like friendly URLs, compromising legitimate domains, image-only pages, and video-only pages with deep fakes. 
- Current machine learning models rely only on textual and URL features so they fail to detect these types of evasive phishing attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- A multi-layer adaptive framework that can process text, images, and video content from a website to improve phishing detection.
- Layer 1: Random Forest model trained on URL features 
- Layer 2: Uses computer vision and OCR to read text content from images
- Layer 3: Converts video to audio and uses speech recognition to synthesize text
- Layer 4: LSTM network combines all text output from other layers and makes final phishing prediction

Main Contributions:
- Proposes an adaptive framework that can detect sophisticated phishing attacks using images, video, audio, and text
- Uses computer vision and speech synthesis to process non-textual content
- Overcomes limitations of existing ML models that rely only on URLs and text
- Experiment shows the framework can accurately detect complex phishing sites with deep fakes
- Open-sources code, datasets, images, videos, and audio to enable reproducibility

In summary, the paper tackles a key limitation of current anti-phishing systems by proposing a multi-modal framework that can process different types of content from a website. The combination of computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing in an adaptive framework enables detecting even complex and evasive phishing attacks. The open datasets and reproducibility also allow future research to build on this work.
