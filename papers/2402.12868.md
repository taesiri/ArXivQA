# [Fast Rates in Online Convex Optimization by Exploiting the Curvature of   Feasible Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of online convex optimization (OCO), where in each round a learner chooses a decision from a convex set and suffers a loss based on a convex loss function revealed after the decision is made. The goal is to minimize regret, which is the difference between the total loss of the learner's decisions and the total loss of the best fixed decision in hindsight. 

Standard algorithms achieve O(√T) regret, but this can be improved by exploiting structure. Prior work showed algorithms like follow-the-leader (FTL) can achieve O(log T) regret by exploiting curvature of the feasible set when the loss functions satisfy certain ideal assumptions. However, FTL suffers limitations:  it requires linear loss functions, entire boundary of feasible set to be curved, and can suffer linear regret if assumptions on loss functions are violated.

Key Contributions:

1) This paper shows algorithms that adapt to the curvature of loss functions can exploit local curvature of feasible sets to achieve O(ρ log T) regret, where ρ captures how much the set curves around the optimal decision. This holds for any convex loss functions, not just linear.

2) The approach works directly in the online convex setting, allowing simultaneous exploitation of curvature of both the feasible set and loss functions. 

3) The approach is robust, achieving O(√T) regret under no assumptions and O(ρ log T + √Cρ log T) regret in corrupted stochastic environments.

4) The analysis extends to uniformly convex feasible sets, attaining regret interpolating between O(log T) for strongly convex sets and O(√T) for general convex sets. This improves upon prior bounds for this setting.

In summary, the paper introduces an approach overcoming limitations of prior work that can robustly exploit local curvature of feasible sets in OCO while handling fully convex loss functions. The analysis leads to tight problem-dependent regret bounds even in non-stochastic environments.
