# [Fast Rates in Online Convex Optimization by Exploiting the Curvature of   Feasible Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper considers the problem of online convex optimization (OCO), where in each round a learner chooses a decision from a convex set and suffers a loss based on a convex loss function revealed after the decision is made. The goal is to minimize regret, which is the difference between the total loss of the learner's decisions and the total loss of the best fixed decision in hindsight. 

Standard algorithms achieve O(√T) regret, but this can be improved by exploiting structure. Prior work showed algorithms like follow-the-leader (FTL) can achieve O(log T) regret by exploiting curvature of the feasible set when the loss functions satisfy certain ideal assumptions. However, FTL suffers limitations:  it requires linear loss functions, entire boundary of feasible set to be curved, and can suffer linear regret if assumptions on loss functions are violated.

Key Contributions:

1) This paper shows algorithms that adapt to the curvature of loss functions can exploit local curvature of feasible sets to achieve O(ρ log T) regret, where ρ captures how much the set curves around the optimal decision. This holds for any convex loss functions, not just linear.

2) The approach works directly in the online convex setting, allowing simultaneous exploitation of curvature of both the feasible set and loss functions. 

3) The approach is robust, achieving O(√T) regret under no assumptions and O(ρ log T + √Cρ log T) regret in corrupted stochastic environments.

4) The analysis extends to uniformly convex feasible sets, attaining regret interpolating between O(log T) for strongly convex sets and O(√T) for general convex sets. This improves upon prior bounds for this setting.

In summary, the paper introduces an approach overcoming limitations of prior work that can robustly exploit local curvature of feasible sets in OCO while handling fully convex loss functions. The analysis leads to tight problem-dependent regret bounds even in non-stochastic environments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops a new analysis for online convex optimization that achieves fast regret rates by exploiting the curvature of feasible sets using algorithms that are adaptive to the curvature of loss functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a new approach to analyze online convex optimization algorithms that can exploit the curvature of feasible sets to achieve fast (logarithmic) regret bounds. Specifically, it shows that algorithms that satisfy a certain "universal online learning" guarantee can automatically exploit curvature and achieve O(ρ log T) regret for feasible sets that are "sphere-enclosed" facing the optimal decision.

2) This approach overcomes limitations of prior work that exploited curvature of feasible sets (which only worked for online linear optimization and made strong assumptions about the loss sequence). In contrast, the proposed approach works for general convex losses, only requires local curvature properties around the optimal decision, and degrades gracefully to O(√T) regret in adversarial settings.

3) The approach is extended to obtain fast rates for uniformly convex feasible sets, interpolating between O(log T) regret for strongly convex sets and O(√T) regret for non-curved sets. An O(T^(q-2)/(2(q-1)) (log T)^(q/(2(q-1)))) rate is proven for q-uniformly convex sets.

4) The approach also works in "corrupted" stochastic environments, achieving O(ρ log T + √C ρ log T) regret where C is the corruption level. Matching lower bounds are provided.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel analysis technique that allows algorithms to automatically adapt to and exploit curvature of feasible sets in various settings, overcoming limitations of prior approaches and leading to tight regret bounds.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

The paper explores achieving fast regret rates in online convex optimization by exploiting the curvature of the feasible set (rather than just the curvature of the loss functions, as is more typical). Key ideas include introducing the concept of "sphere-enclosed" sets to characterize curvature, proving regret bounds that adapt to this local curvature measure, and showing robustness to corrupted stochastic environments. The analysis also connects and compares bounds for strongly convex and uniformly convex sets. Overall, the curvature of feasible sets and adaptivity are central topics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes exploiting the curvature of feasible sets to achieve fast regret rates in online convex optimization. How does the notion of "sphere-enclosedness" differ from traditional measures of curvature like strong convexity? What are the advantages of using sphere-enclosedness?

2) The regret bound achieved is $O(\rho \log T)$ for sphere-enclosed feasible sets. How does this relate to existing lower bounds? Is it known to be tight? Can you describe environments where it would be loose?

3) The paper claims the approach works for adversarial and corrupted stochastic environments, while previous approaches only work for stochastic environments. What modifications were needed in the analysis to handle these more challenging cases? 

4) How does the approach exploit curvature of both the loss functions and feasible sets simultaneously? What adaptation would be needed to optimize this joint exploitation?

5) For uniformly convex feasible sets, the paper proves a regret bound that interpolates between $O(\log T)$ and $O(\sqrt{T})$. How was this interpolation achieved? Can this idea be extended to other curvature-based bounds?  

6) Is the computational efficiency of the algorithm discussed? If not, what considerations would be needed to ensure computational tractability, especially as dimensionality grows?

7) A limitation mentioned is needing stochastic environments. What further work would help relax this assumption while preserving the benefits? Are there other limitations not highlighted that could be addressed?  

8) The analysis relies heavily on existing universal online learning frameworks. What customization was done for this setting and where do opportunities exist for tighter analyses?

9) What further geometrical characterizations beyond sphere-enclosedness could enable faster rates? How can we balance improved rates and practical verification of the needed curvature conditions?

10) For polytope feasible sets, how does the bound compare to existing analyses? What tradeoffs exist between tightness and generality of the results?
