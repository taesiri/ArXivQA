# [Assessing the Aesthetic Evaluation Capabilities of GPT-4 with Vision:   Insights from Group and Individual Assessments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03594)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Few studies have investigated the performance of large language models (LLMs) on sensibility tasks like aesthetic evaluation of images. It is unknown how well the latest LLMs can align with human perception of beauty.

Methods:  
- The authors investigate the aesthetic evaluation capabilities of GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V) on two tasks: 
  1) Predicting average human aesthetic ratings of images (GIAA)
  2) Predicting individual human aesthetic ratings based on few-shot examples (PIAA).

- Experiments explore different prompts for GPT-4V (e.g. question formats, personas, number of examples). Performance is measured by 3-class classification accuracy.

Results:
- Without any fine-tuning, GPT-4V achieves 70.8% accuracy on GIAA and 55.7% on PIAA, much higher than chance.

- Beauty judgments have higher precision, ugliness judgments have higher recall. This suggests different underlying processes.

- Performance is best without constraining personas or questions. More few-shot examples help PIAA performance.

Contributions:  
- First investigation of latest LLMs on image aesthetic evaluation.

- Reveals strong baseline capabilities, the different nature of beauty/ugliness judgments, and prompt engineering best practices.

- Proposes future research directions: integrate conventional models with LLMs, develop structured models based on scientific knowledge of human aesthetic perception.
