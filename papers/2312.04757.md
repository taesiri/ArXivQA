# [Induced Generative Adversarial Particle Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04757)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the induced generative adversarial particle transformer (iGAPT), a new generative adversarial network architecture for simulating jets in high energy physics. iGAPT incorporates "induced particle attention blocks" and conditions on global jet features to capture intricate jet substructure while achieving linear time complexity, unlike prior state-of-the-art models like message-passing GAN (MPGAN). Experiments on 30 and 150 particle gluon, light quark, and top quark jets from the JetNet dataset demonstrate iGAPT’s ability to generate high-fidelity simulations superior to MPGAN on several metrics like Fréchet physics distance and 1-Wasserstein distance. The induced attention mechanism also allows efficient scaling in training and inference time compared to MPGAN's quadratic complexity limitations. While further improvements are possible, iGAPT shows strong potential as an accurate and efficient tool for modeling complex collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Key innovations include the induced particle attention blocks integrating global conditioning, improved model fidelity through physics-informed inductive biases, and linear time complexity enabling extension to higher particle multiplicities.
