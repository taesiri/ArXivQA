## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Segmentation of coronary arteries in non-contrast CT scans is challenging but valuable for less invasive diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing methods have low accuracy as the arteries are very fine structures and hardly visible without contrast enhancement.

Proposed Solution:  
- A registration-based deep learning framework to generate training data and train a model for accurate coronary artery segmentation in non-contrast CT scans.

- Semi-automatic generation of training labels by registering contrast CT scans and segmentations to non-contrast CT scans. Additional verification by experts focuses on proximal artery parts.

- Train 3D U-Net model on registered labels to learn atlas-like knowledge and interpolate segmentation in unseen scans.  

- Generate test set with more accurate labels via manual alignment of contrast CT segmentations to new non-contrast scans.

Key Contributions:
- Novel framework for weak expert supervision to generate large diverse training data for non-contrast CT segmentation.

- New evaluation methodology with manually registered test set to reliably validate model accuracy.

- Model achieves Dice score of 0.65, significantly exceeding validation performance and approaching inter-rater variability.

- Qualitative and quantitative analyses confirm model generalizes well and extracts maximal information from non-contrast scans.

- Findings open possibilities for using models in enhanced calcium scoring, anomaly detection, and radiomics algorithms.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative deep learning approach using registered training data to accurately segment hardly visible coronary arteries in non-contrast CT scans. Thorough evaluation shows high clinical potential to aid diagnosis and cardiovascular risk assessment without contrast agent.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel deep learning framework for segmenting coronary arteries in non-contrast CT scans by generating training data through image registration and evaluating performance using a new manual registration method to create reliable ground truth test data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel framework for automatic generation of ground truth data and training machine learning models to segment coronary arteries in non-contrast CT scans. Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) A registration-based semi-automatic pipeline to generate large volumes of training data by aligning coronary artery segmentations from contrast CT to non-contrast CT scans. This allows creating diverse training data efficiently.

2) A new manual mesh-to-image registration method to create accurate test ground truth data by aligning coronary artery meshes from contrast CT to non-contrast CT scans. This is used to thoroughly evaluate the trained machine learning models. 

3) Training a 3D U-Net model using the nnU-Net framework on the semi-automatically generated training data. The model effectively learns an anatomical atlas able to interpolate the segmentation in regions without a clear signal.

4) Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the trained model using the manually registered test ground truth data. The model achieved a Dice score of 0.65, close to inter-rater variability, demonstrating its ability to extract information from non-contrast CT given the image resolution and signal level.

In summary, the main contribution is the overall framework enabling accurate segmentation of coronary arteries in non-contrast CT scans via efficient ground truth generation and machine learning.
