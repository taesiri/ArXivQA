# [2023 Low-Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC) Summary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07153)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computer vision models are becoming increasingly large and complex to achieve higher accuracy. However, many applications require computer vision to run efficiently with limited resources on edge devices. 
- There is a need to balance accuracy and efficiency for computer vision models to be usable on edge devices. Disaster rescue applications using drones especially require this balance.

Solution:
- The authors organized the 2023 Low Power Computer Vision Challenge (LPCVC), an annual competition to develop high accuracy but efficient computer vision models that can run on embedded devices like Nvidia Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi.

- The 2023 challenge focuses specifically on semantic segmentation of disaster images from drones. Participants compete based on a scoring metric that rewards both accuracy and speed.

- The evaluation uses mean Dice score for accuracy and average inference time per image for speed. The score balances accuracy and speed.

- The submissions are scored automatically using a referee system running on Nvidia Jetson Nano in power efficient mode.

Contributions:  
- The paper highlights methods from the winning teams:
  - ModelTC achieved high speed using a modified UNET with optimizations for inference
  - AidgetRock used a compact Transformer-based model called TopFormer with pruning and distillation
  - ENOT employed PIDNet with upsampling and softmax removal optimizations

- Winning methods all optimized for the edge hardware by using TensorRT, precision optimizations, fusion etc. to maximize speed without losing too much accuracy.

- The competition achieved high participation. Insights from organizing the competition and communication with participants are provided.

In summary, the paper discusses the problem of efficiency vs accuracy trade-off, proposes a competition-based approach to encourage optimized solutions, evaluates solutions systematically, and extracts key learnings from the participants' techniques and the overall process.
