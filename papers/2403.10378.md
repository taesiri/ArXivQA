# [EXAMS-V: A Multi-Discipline Multilingual Multimodal Exam Benchmark for   Evaluating Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10378)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) have limitations - they are mostly English-centric, not from school exams, and keep text and images separate. This fails to properly challenge models on more complex reasoning tasks.

- There is a need for a new challenging multimodal multilingual exam benchmark to better assess sophisticated VLMs.

Solution:
- The authors introduce EXAMS-V, a new benchmark consisting of 20,932 multiple choice questions across 11 languages and 20 subjects, compiled from school exams in different countries.

- The questions feature integrated text, images, tables, figures, diagrams, maps, scientific symbols, and equations, requiring joint reasoning over both visual and textual content.

- The benchmark has broader linguistic scope than prior datasets, with increased representation of low-resource languages like Croatian and Hungarian. It also features higher complexity questions from grades 4-12.

Contributions:
- A novel dimension of unified visual-textual reasoning for benchmarking VLMs, through integrated question images containing both modalities.

- A new large-scale, multidisciplinary, multimodal, multilingual exam dataset that is more realistic and challenging for assessing state-of-the-art VLMs.

- Analysis of multiple VLMs shows there is significant room for improvement, indicating the complexity of EXAMS-V.

In summary, EXAMS-V advances VLM evaluation through a more diverse, intricately reasoning visual-textual benchmark mirroring real-world complexity. This can catalyze progress towards advanced multilingual VLMs with expert-level perception and understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces EXAMS-V, a new multimodal multilingual exam benchmark dataset for evaluating vision language models, consisting of over 20,000 multiple choice questions across 11 languages and 20 subjects that require joint reasoning over text and visual elements like images, tables, and equations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Introducing a new multimodal multilingual exam dataset called EXAMS-V for evaluating vision language models. The dataset has 20,946 multiple choice questions covering 11 languages from 7 language families and spanning 20 subjects.

2) The dataset introduces a new way of benchmarking vision language models by providing an image snapshot of the full question instead of separating text and images. This requires models to do optical character recognition and distinguish between textual and visual elements. 

3) Evaluation of state-of-the-art language models and vision language models on this new benchmark dataset. The results show that the dataset poses a significant challenge even for advanced models like GPT-4V and Gemini, demonstrating its complexity.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing and analyzing a new challenging multimodal multilingual exam dataset that can push vision language models to more sophisticated joint reasoning over unified textual and visual information.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called EXAMS-V for evaluating vision language models. What are some key differences in the data collection and curation process compared to existing VLM datasets like VQA and GQA? How does this impact the complexity and challenge posed to models?

2. The paper evaluates performance using accuracy on multiple choice questions. What are some limitations of this evaluation approach? What additional metrics could reveal further insights into model capabilities and weaknesses? 

3. The results show that augmenting large language models with OCR and image captioning outperforms standalone vision-language models on EXAMS-V. What factors contribute to this performance gap? How could vision-language model architectures evolve to close this gap?

4. What unique challenges does EXAMS-V pose for models in terms of multi-step reasoning across text, images, graphs and tables? Provide some specific examples of complex reasoning required from the dataset. 

5. The vision features are categorized into four types: symbols, figures, graphs and tables. What further sub-categories exist within these groups? What additional fine-grained analysis could reveal further model strengths and weakness?

6. The dataset covers 11 languages from 7 language families. What opportunities exist for cross-lingual transfer learning? Could results on parallel examples expose model biases?

7. The paper identifies higher complexity for Chinese, Arabic and English subsets. What factors contribute to this increased difficulty? How could model limitations be addressed?

8. What risks exist in terms of measurement bias when benchmarking models on school-level exam questions? How well could performance correlate to real-world applications?

9. The data is sourced from regional curriculums and includes some country/region specific content. How well could models transfer across geographic regions? What challenges exist?

10. What data augmentation techniques could be effective for low resource languages in EXAMS-V? Could multimodal alignment provide opportunities?
