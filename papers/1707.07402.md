# [Reinforcement Learning for Bandit Neural Machine Translation with   Simulated Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07402)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach called NED-A2C to improve neural machine translation systems from simulated human feedback. The key idea is to combine an attention-based encoder-decoder neural translation architecture with the advantage actor-critic algorithm. This allows the system to optimize corpus-level translation metrics like BLEU, while being robust to noisy and limited feedback modeled after real human raters. Specifically, the authors simulate three types of noise - granularity (discretization), variance ( randomness), and skew (harshness vs motivational) - in the reward signal to reflect properties of human ratings. They conduct experiments on German-English and Chinese-English translation, showing NED-A2C substantially improves a pretrained system after only one round of simulated feedback. The method withstands moderate amounts of noise without significant performance drops. It is most sensitive to high variance but can still learn effectively. The authors argue that with its stability and sample efficiency, their proposed framework makes it feasible to optimize neural machine translation systems from non-expert human ratings. This can enable cheaper and broader data collection to enhance translation quality while adapting to user preferences.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach combining an attention-based neural machine translation architecture with the advantage actor-critic algorithm to improve translation models from simulated human feedback, and shows this method is robust to realistically noisy feedback.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A strategy to simulate expert and non-expert ratings to evaluate the robustness of bandit structured prediction algorithms in a more realistic environment with noise. The key aspects captured in the simulations are:

a) Mismatch between training objective and feedback-maximizing objective
b) Granularity of human ratings 
c) High variance in individual human ratings
d) Skew between non-expert and expert ratings

2) A reinforcement learning solution combining the advantage actor-critic algorithm with an attention-based neural encoder-decoder architecture for bandit neural machine translation. This algorithm:

a) Is well-designed for problems with large action spaces and delayed rewards
b) Effectively optimizes traditional corpus-level machine translation metrics
c) Is robust to the simulated noisy and imperfect human ratings modeled in the first contribution

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing a way to simulate realistic imperfect human ratings, and an algorithm for bandit neural machine translation that is effective and robust to such imperfect ratings.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it are:

- Bandit structured prediction - The problem setting where an algorithm must make a structured prediction (e.g. a translation), receive only a reward score as feedback, and no ground truth or corrections.

- Neural machine translation (NMT) - The encoder-decoder neural network architecture used for machine translation in this paper.

- Reinforcement learning - The learning paradigm used to optimize the NMT model based only on reward signals, specifically policy gradient methods and actor-critic. 

- Advantage actor-critic (A2C) - The reinforcement learning algorithm combined with NMT that is robust and effective for bandit MT.

- Simulated human ratings - Perturbation functions defined to model granular, high variance, and skewed feedback similar to real human ratings. Used to evaluate robustness. 

- Sentence-level BLEU - A sentence-specific BLEU score used to simulate expert ratings and evaluate performance in a bandit setting.

- Corpus-level BLEU - Traditional corpus-level BLEU metric used to evaluate overall translation quality on a test set.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper proposes combining an encoder-decoder neural machine translation architecture with the advantage actor-critic (A2C) reinforcement learning algorithm. Why is A2C well-suited for problems with large action spaces and delayed rewards like neural machine translation?

2) The paper argues that standard actor-critic algorithms struggle on the bandit neural machine translation problem. What are the two key elements that the supervised learning actor-critic algorithm has that bandit NMT lacks, which cause issues?

3) Explain in detail how the advantage function is estimated in the NED-A2C algorithm using the separate critic network. What are the advantages of using a value function critic versus an action-value critic?

4) The NED-A2C algorithm updates parameters based on a single sampled translation. Explain how the advantage actor-critic formulation helps reduce variance and stabilize training compared to approaches like REINFORCE.

5) The noise model in the paper captures granularity, variance, and skew. Choose one and explain in depth how it is modeled, its motivation from real human annotations, and its impact on algorithm performance.  

6) Discuss the differences in how the NED-A2C algorithm performs when optimized for per-sentence BLEU versus held-out corpus BLEU. Why might held-out BLEU improve less?

7) How could the training method be extended to learn individual rater preferences instead of optimizing for the average score? What changes would need to be made?

8) The paper models noisy rewards as context-independent. Propose an extension to model context-dependent, heteroscedastic noise and discuss any algorithm modifications.  

9) Compare the NED-A2C approach to other related reinforcement learning structured prediction methods like SEARN, DAGGER, and MIXER. What are the tradeoffs?

10) The paper focuses on simulation experiments. Discuss what considerations would be important in deploying this approach with real-time crowdsourced human ratings.
