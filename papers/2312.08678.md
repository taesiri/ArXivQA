# [Deep Learning with Physics Priors as Generalized Regularizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08678)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a method to incorporate approximate physics models, which may contain uncertainties, as generalized regularizers when training deep learning models on scientific data. Using the principle of structural risk minimization, the imperfect physics models are structured as regularization terms in the loss function to prevent overfitting. The physics priors act as projections of the epistemic uncertainties onto the function space of the trained model. Since the information content bounded by the uncertainties is unknown a priori, the regularization parameter and model weights are co-optimized. Experiments on modeling Hamiltonian systems, and solving reaction, reaction-diffusion, and convection PDEs demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves up to two orders of magnitude improvement in testing accuracy over baseline methods. The framework permits flexible inclusion of multiple plausible physics priors simultaneously. Additionally, optimizing the coefficients of the physics models along with the deep learning model itself provides the approximate physics model with minimum epistemic uncertainty as judged by the data.
