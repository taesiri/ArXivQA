# [Emergent Word Order Universals from Cognitively-Motivated Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12363)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Explaining the source of word order biases (so-called "universals") in human languages is a key challenge in linguistics. For example, why do SOV languages often have postpositions while SVO languages typically have prepositions?
- Simply correlating properties of existing languages has limitations in elucidating the underlying mechanisms behind these biases. 

Proposed Solution and Contributions:
- The authors computationally simulate word order universals via language models (LMs) to study their emergence through cognitive biases.
- They compare multiple cognitively-motivated LMs against standard LMs on their ability to replicate typological markedness in their word order preferences on controlled artificial languages.
- Their experiments show LMs with syntactic biases, left-corner parsing strategies, and memory limitations better simulate the frequency distribution of attested word order configurations.
- This suggests the interplay of these cognitive factors and predictability (perplexity) can explain many word order universals, providing computational evidence of their cognitive underpinnings.
- Results demonstrate the advantage of cognitively-motivated LMs in not just modeling sentence processing but also simulating typological biases, further validating their usefulness in cognitive modeling.

In summary, this work leverages cognitively-plausible language models to provide a computationally-grounded explanation of the source of many linguistic word order universals based on human cognitive biases related to efficient sentence processing and prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how cognitively motivated language models with syntactic biases, specific parsing strategies, and memory limitations better simulate typologically common word orders found across human languages compared to standard neural language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating that language models with cognitively motivated biases, such as syntactic inductive biases, human-like parsing strategies, and memory limitations, can better simulate typological universals of word order found across human languages. Specifically, the experiments show that the perplexity estimated by these cognitively motivated language models tends to correlate better with the distribution of attested word orders compared to standard neural language models without such biases. This suggests that the interplay of cognitive biases related to efficient language processing and predictability can help explain implicational universals of word order. Overall, the work provides computational evidence for the theory that universal properties of human languages are shaped by biases for efficient processing, and showcases the advantage of using cognitively-motivated language models in modeling such linguistic universals.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Word order universals - The paper studies biases and patterns in word order across languages, known as word order universals.

- Implicational universals - A type of word order universal where certain word orders tend to imply or predict other syntactic properties. For example, SOV languages often have postpositions.  

- Typological markedness - The phenomenon where some word order configurations are much more frequent or "unmarked" across languages compared to others. The paper tries to model this.

- Perplexity - A measure of how well a language model can predict words in a sequence. Lower perplexity indicates better predictability. The paper uses perplexity estimated on artificial languages with different word orders to quantify word order biases.

- Cognitively motivated language models - Language models designed to mimic aspects of human language processing and biases, such as syntactic biases, parsing strategies, and memory limitations. The paper shows these do better at modeling word order typology.

- Computational simulation - Using language models and artificial languages to computationally model and test theories and biases related to patterns in human languages.

So in summary, key terms revolve around using perplexity and cognitively motivated LMs for computational simulation of word order universals and typological markedness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper indicates typologically typical word orders tend to have lower perplexity estimated by language models with cognitively plausible biases. What specific types of cognitively plausible biases are explored in the experiments (syntactic biases, parsing strategies, memory limitations)? And what advantages do they provide over standard language models in simulating word order universals?

2. The paper introduces local correlation and global correlation metrics. What is the difference between these two metrics and what do higher scores in each metric indicate about a language model's ability to simulate word order universals?  

3. The concept of linking functions between perplexity and word order frequency is explored. What impact did using different linking functions have on the overall conclusions? Do you think the choice of linking function could have biased the results in some way?

4. The paper indicates subject-object-verb order remains challenging for the language models to fully capture compared to other parameters. What explanations are provided for why this might be the case? Do you think there are other factors that could explain this finding?

5. What specific advantages did the left-corner parsing strategy provide over the top-down strategy in aligning language model perplexity with typological markedness patterns? Why is the left-corner strategy considered more cognitively plausible?

6. The memory-limited simple recurrent neural network grammar (SRNNG) generally outperformed the standard recurrent neural network grammar (RNNG). Why does imposing memory limitations result in improved correlation with typological markedness?

7. The analysis introduces the concept of syntactically-biased predictability to subsume both predictability and parsability factors. Do the results provide evidence that syntactic language models alone can sufficiently account for word order universals without needing an explicit parsability factor?

8. The artificial languages generated contain a wide range of construction types but lack some realism such as discourse-level factors. How significant of a limitation do you think this is? Could the lack of realism explain why subject-object-verb order remains difficult to fully model?

9. The paper demonstrates predicting parsing action sequences helps model word order universals. Do you think directly modeling and predicting entire parse trees rather than action sequences could provide any further advantages in capturing typological biases or would face computational constraints?

10. If this simulation of word order universals was extended to assess additional impossible or unnatural languages, what challenges do you foresee models still facing? Are there some types of impossible languages that might be easier for models to identify than violations of word order universals?
