# [Conditional Contrastive Learning with Kernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05458v3)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to overcome the limitation of insufficient data in conditional contrastive learning frameworks. Conditional contrastive learning constructs positive or negative data pairs by sampling from conditional distributions, e.g. sampling negatives from the same gender to remove gender bias. However, this conditional sampling procedure requires sufficient data for each value of the conditioning variable. The paper proposes an alternative formulation using kernel conditional embedding to avoid explicit conditional sampling, enabling contrastive learning with insufficient data or continuous conditioning variables.
