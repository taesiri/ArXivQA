# [FineFake: A Knowledge-Enriched Dataset for Fine-Grained Multi-Domain   Fake News Detecction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing fake news detection datasets have limitations in generality as they typically focus on news from a single semantic topic or platform. This fails to capture the diversity of multi-domain news in real-world scenarios.  
- External knowledge and fine-grained annotations are lacking in current datasets. These are important to provide precise evidence and uncover diverse fabrication strategies across domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel multi-domain knowledge-enhanced benchmark with fine-grained annotations called "FineFake". 
- FineFake contains 16,909 news samples spanning six semantic topics and eight platforms.
- Each news item is enriched with multi-modal content, potential social context, semi-manually verified common knowledge, and fine-grained annotations beyond binary labels.
- FineFake employs a six-category annotation scheme that reveals reasons behind detected fake news.
- The authors formulate three challenging tasks based on FineFake: binary classification, fine-grained classification, and multi-domain adaptation.
- They also propose a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network (KEAN) to address the covariate and label shift problems in FineFake.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of FineFake benchmark which is the first multi-domain knowledge-enhanced fake news dataset with fine-grained annotations.
- Incorporation of reliable common knowledge through semi-manual labeling to provide accurate evidence.  
- Introduction of an innovative fine-grained annotation strategy with six categories that uncovers diverse reasons behind fake news.
- Formulation of three challenging tasks for benchmarking state-of-the-art models.
- Extensive experiments under various settings to provide accurate and reliable benchmarks.
- Proposal of KEAN model to address key domain shift problems and achieve state-of-the-art performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FineFake, a multi-domain fake news detection dataset with fine-grained annotations and knowledge enrichment, and develops a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network (KEAN) to address domain shift issues.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing FineFake, a knowledge-enriched dataset for fine-grained multi-domain fake news detection. FineFake spans multiple topics and platforms, incorporates accurate common knowledge, and uses a fine-grained labeling scheme with 6 categories.

2. Designing 3 challenging tasks based on FineFake - binary classification, fine-grained classification, and multi-domain adaptation. Extensive experiments are conducted on these tasks to provide benchmarks.  

3. Proposing KEAN, a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network, to simultaneously address the covariate shift and label shift problems in fake news detection. Experiments show KEAN achieves state-of-the-art performance across most scenarios.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing the FineFake dataset, formulating tasks based on it to provide benchmarks, and proposing the KEAN model for multi-domain fake news detection. The key highlights are the multi-domain attribute, incorporation of knowledge, and fine-grained annotations of the dataset.
