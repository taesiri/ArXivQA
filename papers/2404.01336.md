# [FineFake: A Knowledge-Enriched Dataset for Fine-Grained Multi-Domain   Fake News Detecction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing fake news detection datasets have limitations in generality as they typically focus on news from a single semantic topic or platform. This fails to capture the diversity of multi-domain news in real-world scenarios.  
- External knowledge and fine-grained annotations are lacking in current datasets. These are important to provide precise evidence and uncover diverse fabrication strategies across domains.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a novel multi-domain knowledge-enhanced benchmark with fine-grained annotations called "FineFake". 
- FineFake contains 16,909 news samples spanning six semantic topics and eight platforms.
- Each news item is enriched with multi-modal content, potential social context, semi-manually verified common knowledge, and fine-grained annotations beyond binary labels.
- FineFake employs a six-category annotation scheme that reveals reasons behind detected fake news.
- The authors formulate three challenging tasks based on FineFake: binary classification, fine-grained classification, and multi-domain adaptation.
- They also propose a knowledge-enhanced domain adaptation network (KEAN) to address the covariate and label shift problems in FineFake.

Main Contributions:
- Construction of FineFake benchmark which is the first multi-domain knowledge-enhanced fake news dataset with fine-grained annotations.
- Incorporation of reliable common knowledge through semi-manual labeling to provide accurate evidence.  
- Introduction of an innovative fine-grained annotation strategy with six categories that uncovers diverse reasons behind fake news.
- Formulation of three challenging tasks for benchmarking state-of-the-art models.
- Extensive experiments under various settings to provide accurate and reliable benchmarks.
- Proposal of KEAN model to address key domain shift problems and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
