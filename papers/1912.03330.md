# [ClusterFit: Improving Generalization of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03330)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can we improve the generalization of visual representations learned during pre-training in weakly-supervised and self-supervised frameworks? The authors propose that the visual representations learned via these pre-training approaches may overfit to idiosyncrasies of the pre-training task and data. Their key insight is that "smoothing" the learned feature space, for example via clustering, can help remove artifacts from the pre-training objective and avoid overfitting, thus improving transferrability. To address this question, the authors propose a framework called ClusterFit which involves:1) Clustering the features extracted from a network pre-trained on some proxy task, using k-means. 2) Retraining a new network from scratch on the same dataset, using the cluster assignments as pseudo-labels.Through extensive experiments on various pre-training methods (weakly supervised, self-supervised) and modalities (images, videos), the authors demonstrate that ClusterFit consistently improves generalization and transferrability of the learned representations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that clustering helps "smooth" the feature space and removes artifacts of the pre-training objective, thereby improving transfer learning performance. The proposed ClusterFit framework is evaluated as a way to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a method called ClusterFit to improve the generalization and transferability of visual representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during pre-training. The key ideas are:- Using k-means clustering on features extracted from a pre-trained CNN to get pseudo-labels. This helps remove any biases or artifacts present in the original pre-trained model that cause it to overfit to the pre-training task/dataset.- Retraining a new CNN from scratch on the dataset using these pseudo-labels for supervision. This allows learning a more robust feature representation less coupled to the original pre-training objective.- Showing consistent improvements across diverse pre-training methods (weakly-supervised, self-supervised), modalities (images, videos), architectures, and transfer learning datasets through extensive experiments.So in summary, the core contribution is presenting ClusterFit, a simple and generalizable technique to "smooth" the pre-trained feature space and improve its transferability to new tasks and datasets. This is shown to work for different pre-training approaches without requiring changes to model architecture, extra data, or additional supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes ClusterFit, a simple yet effective approach to improve the generalization of visual features learned during weakly-supervised or self-supervised pre-training by clustering the features from a pre-trained model and re-training a new model using the cluster assignments as pseudo-labels.
