# [ClusterFit: Improving Generalization of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03330)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can we improve the generalization of visual representations learned during pre-training in weakly-supervised and self-supervised frameworks? The authors propose that the visual representations learned via these pre-training approaches may overfit to idiosyncrasies of the pre-training task and data. Their key insight is that "smoothing" the learned feature space, for example via clustering, can help remove artifacts from the pre-training objective and avoid overfitting, thus improving transferrability. To address this question, the authors propose a framework called ClusterFit which involves:1) Clustering the features extracted from a network pre-trained on some proxy task, using k-means. 2) Retraining a new network from scratch on the same dataset, using the cluster assignments as pseudo-labels.Through extensive experiments on various pre-training methods (weakly supervised, self-supervised) and modalities (images, videos), the authors demonstrate that ClusterFit consistently improves generalization and transferrability of the learned representations.In summary, the central hypothesis is that clustering helps "smooth" the feature space and removes artifacts of the pre-training objective, thereby improving transfer learning performance. The proposed ClusterFit framework is evaluated as a way to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a method called ClusterFit to improve the generalization and transferability of visual representations learned by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during pre-training. The key ideas are:- Using k-means clustering on features extracted from a pre-trained CNN to get pseudo-labels. This helps remove any biases or artifacts present in the original pre-trained model that cause it to overfit to the pre-training task/dataset.- Retraining a new CNN from scratch on the dataset using these pseudo-labels for supervision. This allows learning a more robust feature representation less coupled to the original pre-training objective.- Showing consistent improvements across diverse pre-training methods (weakly-supervised, self-supervised), modalities (images, videos), architectures, and transfer learning datasets through extensive experiments.So in summary, the core contribution is presenting ClusterFit, a simple and generalizable technique to "smooth" the pre-trained feature space and improve its transferability to new tasks and datasets. This is shown to work for different pre-training approaches without requiring changes to model architecture, extra data, or additional supervision.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes ClusterFit, a simple yet effective approach to improve the generalization of visual features learned during weakly-supervised or self-supervised pre-training by clustering the features from a pre-trained model and re-training a new model using the cluster assignments as pseudo-labels.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on improving generalization of visual representations:- The main technique proposed in this paper is ClusterFit, which involves clustering the features from a pretrained model and then training a new model from scratch on the cluster assignments as pseudo-labels. This is a simple yet effective approach for "smoothing" the feature space to remove artifacts that cause overfitting to the pretraining task. - ClusterFit builds off prior work that has used clustering in self-supervised representation learning, such as DeepCluster and SwAV. However, a key difference is that ClusterFit applies clustering in a post-hoc manner on an already pretrained model, rather than using clustering as the training objective itself. This makes ClusterFit more flexible and scalable.- The paper shows ClusterFit can be applied to various pretrained models - weakly supervised (trained on noisy hashtag data), self-supervised (Rotation, Jigsaw), and even fully supervised. This demonstrates ClusterFit is a broad technique not tied to any specific pretraining approach. Other related techniques are more tailored to a specific pretraining method.- The improvements from ClusterFit are shown to be complementary to other common approaches like longer pretraining and model distillation. The paper directly compares to these techniques and shows ClusterFit provides additional gains.- The results demonstrate broad improvements across many downstream tasks and datasets - 11 in total spanning image classification, scene recognition, action recognition. This shows the general value of ClusterFit for visual representations. Other works have shown gains on fewer or more specific tasks.- The scale of pretraining data used is very large - up to 1B Instagram images and 19M Instagram videos. ClusterFit is shown to work at this size, whereas most prior works evaluate on smaller datasets.In summary, ClusterFit distinguishes itself in terms of its simplicity, flexibility across pretraining approaches, strong performance across diverse tasks, and scalability to huge datasets. The empirical results comprehensively demonstrate its effectiveness for improving generalization.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:- Incorporating domain knowledge from downstream target tasks to guide the clustering step in ClusterFit. This could potentially improve the quality of the pseudo-labels and boost transfer learning performance.- Iteratively applying ClusterFit multiple times. The paper notes that in its current unsupervised form, iterative application provides little improvement. However, incorporating domain knowledge in the clustering may make iterative application more beneficial.- Combining different types of pre-trained models (e.g. weakly supervised, self-supervised) in a multi-task manner when learning the cluster assignments. The authors show a simple version of this for self-supervised models that provides good gains.- Using more advanced evidence accumulation clustering techniques like consensus clustering instead of k-means. This may lead to more robust pseudo-labels.- Exploring how to best leverage the flexibility of ClusterFit to combine diverse modalities of data like images, videos, text etc. during pre-training.- Studying how the granularity and nature of the pre-training label space affects ClusterFit. The paper performs some initial analysis but further investigation could be useful.In summary, the main future directions are around incorporating domain knowledge in the clustering, combining diverse pre-trained models and modalities, using more advanced clustering techniques, and better understanding how properties of the pre-training data affect ClusterFit.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes ClusterFit, a method to improve the generalization of visual representations learned during pre-training. The key idea is to apply k-means clustering on the features extracted from a pre-trained model to remove any artifacts or biases from the pre-training task. Specifically, they take a pretrained model, extract features from a dataset using that model, cluster those features using k-means to generate pseudo-labels, and then train a new model from scratch on the dataset using the cluster assignments as labels. This "smooths" the feature space and removes the biases from pre-training. They show ClusterFit improves performance on transfer learning benchmarks across different pre-training methods (weakly supervised, self-supervised), modalities (images, videos), architectures, and datasets. For example, for self-supervised pretraining on ImageNet, ClusterFit improves top-1 accuracy by 7-9% on ImageNet and 3-7% mAP on PASCAL VOC. The simplicity and universality of ClusterFit allows it to work well in many settings to improve generalization of pretrained representations.
