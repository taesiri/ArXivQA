# [Code-Mixed Probes Show How Pre-Trained Models Generalise On   Code-Switched Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04872)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Code-switching (CS) is a prevalent phenomenon where multilingual speakers seamlessly switch between languages. 
- CS data is useful for evaluating how well language models can capture meaning, since the presence of multiple languages requires models to learn meaning across languages instead of relying on spurious patterns.
- However, research on CS is challenging due to the scarcity of labelled CS data/resources.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create a novel Spanglish (Spanish-English) CS dataset with parallel translations in both languages to allow for controlled evaluation. 
- They perform experiments probing popular language models (LMs) - mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa base/large - on their ability to:
   (a) detect CS text 
   (b) capture syntactic structure of CS  
   (c) represent semantics of CS consistently compared to monolingual text
- They also generate synthetic CS data for comparison.

Main Contributions:
- First curated corpus of naturalistic Spanglish CS sentences with parallel Spanish/English translations
- Extensive experiments probing LMs' CS detection ability, syntactic structure encoding, semantic consistency
- Findings show LMs are surprisingly effective at generalizing to real CS text in all three dimensions, indicating potential to harness monolingual data for CS
- Reveals high performance degrades significantly on synthetic CS data, highlighting importance of naturalistic data
- Provides framework for future empirical verification of linguistic theories of CS based on usage-based language acquisition

The paper makes key contributions in creating resources and methodology to systematically evaluate language models' capabilities on code-switched text. The findings reveal promising model generalization abilities to real code-switching without explicit training.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates how pre-trained language models handle code-switched text in Spanish-English by evaluating their ability to detect, capture syntactic structure, and represent semantics of code-switched text using probes and by creating a novel Spanish-English code-switched dataset with monolingual translations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The creation of the first curated dataset of well-formed, naturalistic instances of Spanglish code-switched data with translations for both Spanish and English source languages. This allows for precise evaluation of grammatical structure and sentence meaning.

2) Extensive experiments to determine the extent to which pre-trained language models can detect code-switched text and capture both the structure and meaning associated with it. This includes experiments in code-switching detection, syntax, and semantics.

3) The extension of the manually curated dataset with synthetic data to allow for ablation studies and controls such as varying the mix of languages in the code-switched text. 

4) Providing a template for future experimental verification of linguistic theories pertaining to code-switching based on the usage-based principle of language acquisition.

So in summary, the main contributions are the new code-switched dataset, experiments probing how well PLMs handle code-switching, extension with synthetic data, and a framework for future code-switching research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key keywords and terms associated with this paper include:

- Code-switching
- Probing language models 
- Multilingualism
- Pre-trained language models (PLMs)
- Spanglish
- Synthetic code-switching data
- Detection experiments
- Syntax experiments
- Semantics experiments
- Graph edit distance

The paper introduces a novel dataset of naturalistic code-switched Spanglish text along with parallel translations into Spanish and English. It then conducts experiments probing popular pre-trained language models (PLMs) like mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa in three dimensions related to code-switching: detection, syntax, and semantics. Some key findings are that PLMs seem effective at detecting and capturing meaning in code-switched text between closely related languages like Spanish and English. The paper also utilizes synthetic code-switching data and graph edit distance for comparisons in the syntax experiments. So those are some of the main keywords and terminology highlighted in this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) The paper introduces a new dataset of code-switched Spanglish text. What techniques were used to collect and curate this dataset? How was the data quality ensured through the editing and translation process?

2) The paper utilizes both real and synthetic code-switched data in the experiments. What are the relative benefits and limitations of using each type of data? Why is it still useful to include synthetic data despite the lower performance?  

3) The detection experiments aim to determine if models can distinguish between monolingual and code-switched text. What differences in the model architectures and pooling strategies impacted the performance on this task? Why might the CLS token struggle to capture code-switching cues?

4) The syntax experiments extract dependency parses to compare code-switched and monolingual sentences. Why is graph edit distance used for this comparison instead of more standard accuracy metrics? What theories from linguistics motivated exploring the structural similarity to each language?

5) For the semantics experiments, what specifically does it mean for the models to be "consistent" in representing meaning between monolingual and code-switched text? Why is this an important evaluation criteria?

6) The fine-tuned SEM models failed to show consistency on synthetic data but succeeded on real examples. What factors could explain this discrepancy in performance? Does this reveal insights on how models represent meaning?

7) Across the experiments, what general conclusions can be drawn about the ability of models to detect and represent key properties of code-switched text without being explicitly trained on it? How does performance vary between the base and large versions?

8) How well does the overall framework of experiments align with demonstrating key theories of code-switching from the field of linguistics? What theories seem most relevant to the results obtained?

9) The paper focuses solely on Spanish-English code-switching. What are the limitations of this scope and what additional language pairs should be studied in future work? Would you expect similar performance generalizability? 

10) What practical implications do these findings have for the development of NLP systems to process code-switched text, especially in light of data limitations? How can performance on downstream tasks be further improved?
