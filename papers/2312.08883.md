# [EditGuard: Versatile Image Watermarking for Tamper Localization and   Copyright Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08883)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
In the era of advanced AI image generation models, the threat of malicious image tampering and unauthorized copyright infringement poses imminent risks. Existing image watermarking methods fall short in accurately localizing realistic image forgeries and providing copyright protection simultaneously. There is an urgent need for a versatile framework that unites tamper localization and copyright protection.

Proposed Solution - EditGuard Framework: 
The authors propose EditGuard, an innovative proactive image forensics framework to embed dual invisible watermarks - a localization watermark and a copyright watermark into original images. At the decoding end, it can precisely extract the tampered regions and copyright information from received (potentially tampered) images. 

The framework employs a sequential encoding and parallel decoding structure. The dual-watermark encoder hides the localization and copyright watermarks sequentially into the original image to generate the protected container image. The tamper locator reveals the localization watermark to produce the predicted tampered mask. Meanwhile, the copyright extractor accurately reconstructs the copyright watermark.

By transforming EditGuard's realization into a united image-bit steganography network (IBSN) and utilizing its pre-trained components, the training process is completely decoupled from specific tampering types. This endows EditGuard with exceptional generalizability for tamper localization in a zero-shot manner without needing any labeled forged data.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to provide versatile tamper localization and copyright protection via dual invisible watermarks.

2) Innovatively transformed the solution into an image-bit steganography network (IBSN) and constructed EditGuard using IBSN's components. 

3) Introduced prompt-based posterior estimation to enhance robustness against distortions.  

4) Extensive experiments proved EditGuard's superiority in balancing tamper localization accuracy, copyright protection precision and extensive applicability over state-of-the-art across various benchmarks and realistic datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a versatile proactive forensics framework called EditGuard that unifies copyright protection and tamper localization for images by embedding both a localization watermark and a copyright watermark, allowing accurate decoding of tampered areas and copyright information even for advanced AI-generated content manipulation methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It presents the first attempt to design a versatile proactive forensics framework EditGuard for universal tamper localization and copyright protection. It embeds dual invisible watermarks into original images and accurately decodes tampered areas and copyright information.

2) It observes the fragility and locality of image-to-image (I2I) steganography and innovatively converts the solution of this dual forensics task into training a united Image-Bit Steganography Network (IBSN). The core components of IBSN are then used to construct EditGuard. 

3) It introduces a prompt-based posterior estimation module to enhance the localization accuracy and degradation robustness of the proposed framework. 

4) It verifies the effectiveness of the method on constructed datasets and classical benchmarks. Compared to other competitive methods, the approach has merits in localization precision, generalization abilities, and copyright accuracy without needing any labeled data or additional training for specific tampering types.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new versatile and proactive image forensics framework called EditGuard that can provide both tamper localization and copyright protection without needing to train on tampered data.
