# [Beyond Voice Assistants: Exploring Advantages and Risks of an In-Car   Social Robot in Real Driving Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11853)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In-car voice assistants (VAs) have limitations in sustaining driver engagement and enhancing experience over long-term use. They are mostly limited to simple "query-answer" tasks.

- Integrating social robots with VAs can potentially address these limitations, but prior attempts have not seamlessly integrated VA functions and robot interactions.

- There is a lack of studies evaluating real in-car robots in realistic driving scenarios to understand their impact on user experience. 

Methodology:
- The authors utilized NOMI, an in-car robot assistant (RA) with both VA capabilities and an embodied robot display.

- They conducted a user study interviewing 30 participants on their experience with in-car VAs.  

- 10 participants then underwent non-driving and real on-road experiments with NOMI under different conditions: with/without visual access to NOMI, online/offline system modes.

- Multiple metrics were used: recognition accuracy, response times, workload, engagement level, etc. along with interviews.  

- Personality perception for the RA was also evaluated.

- Privacy and ethical risks were additionally investigated.

Key Findings:
- Visual access to NOMI enhanced user experience metrics like engagement, despite no change in VA performance.

- Participants felt a sense of companionship and reassurance from NOMI during driving.

- NOMI encouraged users to converse more and created a desire to interact.

- Users highlighted NOMI's personality traits like warmth and extraversion.

- Users had limited awareness of privacy risks initially but concerns emerged after prompting.

Contributions:  
- First comprehensive user study comparing an in-car VA, with and without a social robot, using real on-road driving.

- Demonstrated the ability of the robot to enhance engagement, reduce workload, and provide companionship. 

- Highlighted both benefits of the social robot as well as associated privacy and ethical risks.

- Provided design recommendations for developing in-car social robots.
