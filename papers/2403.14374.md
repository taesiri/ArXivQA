# [FIT-RAG: Black-Box RAG with Factual Information and Token Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14374)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with factual errors and hallucinations due to limited inherent knowledge that can become outdated. Finetuning LLMs is costly. 
- Existing black-box retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods for LLMs have issues: they ignore factual information which misleads the retriever, and they waste tokens by concatenating all retrieved docs.

Proposed Solution:
- A new RAG framework called FIT-RAG that utilizes factual information and LLM preferences for effective retrieval, and reduces tokens via self-knowledge recognition and sub-document token reduction.

Key Components:
- Bi-label document scorer - scores retrieved docs on factual information and LLM preference labels. Handles data imbalance.
- Bi-faceted self-knowledge recognizer - determines if a question requires retrieval or if the LLM's knowledge suffices. 
- Sub-document token reducer - eliminates redundant tokens via document splitting, eligibility detection and greedy search.
- Prompt construction - sophisticated prompt design to guide LLM.

Main Contributions:  
- Novel bi-label document scorer using data-imbalance-aware bi-label learning that considers both factual information and LLM preferences.
- Bi-faceted self-knowledge recognizer to determine necessity of retrieval augmentation.
- Sub-document token reduction technique to substantially lower tokens. 
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and 50% token reduction over strong baselines on multiple QA datasets.

The summary covers the key problem FIT-RAG tries to solve, provides an overview of the proposed solution and main components, and highlights the three major contributions - the bi-label document scorer, self-knowledge recognizer and sub-document token reducer. It also notes the significantly improved performance and efficiency over baselines.
