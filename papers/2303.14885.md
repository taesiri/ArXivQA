# [Text is All You Need: Personalizing ASR Models using Controllable Speech   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions appear to be:1) When is using personalized synthetic speech data effective for adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to target speakers? 2) Why does using personalized synthetic speech data help with ASR speaker adaptation? 3) How can the selection of personalized synthetic speech data be improved to make ASR speaker adaptation more effective?To summarize:- The paper aims to understand when, why and how using synthesized personalized speech can help adapt generic ASR models to specific target speakers, given the scarcity of real personalized speech data. - It studies when synthetic personalized data helps by looking at different target speaker categories and model capacities.- It investigates why synthetic personalized data helps by experimenting with different styles and contents for the synthesized speech. - It proposes a method to improve synthetic data selection based on gradient matching to select more optimal content.So in essence, the central research questions revolve around better understanding and improving the use of synthesized personalized speech data for ASR speaker adaptation.
