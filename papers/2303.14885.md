# [Text is All You Need: Personalizing ASR Models using Controllable Speech   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14885)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions appear to be:1) When is using personalized synthetic speech data effective for adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to target speakers? 2) Why does using personalized synthetic speech data help with ASR speaker adaptation? 3) How can the selection of personalized synthetic speech data be improved to make ASR speaker adaptation more effective?To summarize:- The paper aims to understand when, why and how using synthesized personalized speech can help adapt generic ASR models to specific target speakers, given the scarcity of real personalized speech data. - It studies when synthetic personalized data helps by looking at different target speaker categories and model capacities.- It investigates why synthetic personalized data helps by experimenting with different styles and contents for the synthesized speech. - It proposes a method to improve synthetic data selection based on gradient matching to select more optimal content.So in essence, the central research questions revolve around better understanding and improving the use of synthesized personalized speech data for ASR speaker adaptation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is providing insights into automatic speech recognition (ASR) model personalization using synthetic data. Specifically, the paper:- Establishes an experimental framework for personalizing a state-of-the-art ASR model to different types of target speakers using a controllable speech synthesis model. - Identifies two factors that influence when ASR personalization with synthetic data is effective: (1) when the target speaker is underrepresented in the global training data, and (2) when model capacity is limited.- Shows that matching the style of the synthetic speech to the target speaker is not crucial for adaptation. Rather, matching the text content of the synthetic data to the target domain is more important. - Proposes using gradient matching as a strategy for selecting synthetic data content to better match the target domain, yielding improved personalization performance.In summary, the key contribution is providing a comprehensive study on when, why and how ASR model personalization with synthetic data works, leading to novel insights about the importance of synthetic speech content over style. The controllable speech synthesis framework introduced enables further analyses into the role of synthetic data for personalization.
