# [FinReport: Explainable Stock Earnings Forecasting via News Factor   Analyzing Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Stock earnings forecasting is important for investors but challenging due to the randomness and volatility of the stock market. Compared to financial institutions, it is difficult for ordinary investors to mine relevant factors from complex news and stock data to make investment decisions. Although large language models like BloombergGPT can provide some assistance through dialogues, users still need substantial financial knowledge to ask reasonable questions.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FinReport, an automated system to generate professional stock earnings forecasting reports for ordinary investors. FinReport has three modules:

1) News Factorization Module: Uses semantic role labeling and semantic dependency parsing to extract key information from news. Combines this with stock factors to predict news categories related to returns.

2) Return Forecasting Module: Incorporates news categories into the Fama-French 5-factor model to forecast stock returns from multiple dimensions like market risk, valuation, profitability etc.  

3) Risk Assessment Module: Employs EGARCH model for VaR risk assessment to estimate maximum potential loss.

Finally, a large language model generates an interpretable report with sections on return forecasts, risk assessment, overall trend predictions and summary based on outputs of these modules.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel automated system FinReport to generate professional stock earnings forecasting reports for ordinary investors
- Introduces news factorization, return forecasting and risk assessment modules for reliable and accurate analysis
- Achieves superior performance in forecasting accuracy, risk assessment and real trading scenarios compared to benchmarks
- Generates highly readable reports to lower barrier for ordinary investors with limited financial knowledge

The solution makes stock earnings forecasting more convenient, interpretable and accessible to ordinary investors.
