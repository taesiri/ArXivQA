# [FinReport: Explainable Stock Earnings Forecasting via News Factor   Analyzing Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02647)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Stock earnings forecasting is important for investors but challenging due to the randomness and volatility of the stock market. Compared to financial institutions, it is difficult for ordinary investors to mine relevant factors from complex news and stock data to make investment decisions. Although large language models like BloombergGPT can provide some assistance through dialogues, users still need substantial financial knowledge to ask reasonable questions.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes FinReport, an automated system to generate professional stock earnings forecasting reports for ordinary investors. FinReport has three modules:

1) News Factorization Module: Uses semantic role labeling and semantic dependency parsing to extract key information from news. Combines this with stock factors to predict news categories related to returns.

2) Return Forecasting Module: Incorporates news categories into the Fama-French 5-factor model to forecast stock returns from multiple dimensions like market risk, valuation, profitability etc.  

3) Risk Assessment Module: Employs EGARCH model for VaR risk assessment to estimate maximum potential loss.

Finally, a large language model generates an interpretable report with sections on return forecasts, risk assessment, overall trend predictions and summary based on outputs of these modules.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes a novel automated system FinReport to generate professional stock earnings forecasting reports for ordinary investors
- Introduces news factorization, return forecasting and risk assessment modules for reliable and accurate analysis
- Achieves superior performance in forecasting accuracy, risk assessment and real trading scenarios compared to benchmarks
- Generates highly readable reports to lower barrier for ordinary investors with limited financial knowledge

The solution makes stock earnings forecasting more convenient, interpretable and accessible to ordinary investors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes FinReport, an explainable stock earnings forecasting system that utilizes news factorization, return forecasting, and risk assessment modules along with large language models to automatically generate professional investment analysis reports for ordinary investors.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. This is the first work that introduces a financial report model to automatically collect information, analyze, and summarize for ordinary investors. 

2. The paper proposes three sub-modules to respectively address news factorization, return forecasting, and risk assessment, making the reporting more reliable.

3. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and explainability of the proposed solution for generating financial reports.

In summary, the key contribution is an automatic system called FinReport that can generate readable and explainable financial analysis reports for ordinary investors by extracting and analyzing news and stock data. The system aims to serve the user experience better compared to manual search or conversing with large language models that require financial knowledge.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Stock earnings forecasting - The main task discussed in the paper.

- News factorization - One of the three main modules of the proposed FinReport model, involves understanding news and combining it with stock factors. 

- Return forecasting - Another main module of FinReport, analyzes impact of news on market sentiment and stock returns.

- Risk assessment - Third module of FinReport, employs EGARCH model for VaR analysis. 

- Semantic role labeling (SRL) - Used to identify predicates and label semantic roles within sentences in news.

- Semantic dependency parsing graph (SDPG) - Transforms sentences into structured graphs with semantic dependencies.

- Fama-French 5 factors model - Baseline model for stock return forecasting, enhanced by incorporating news factors. 

- Value at Risk (VaR) - Used in risk assessment module to estimate maximum potential loss.

- Large language models (LLMs) - Used at end to generate readable and explainable investment reports.

Other keywords include: multi-factor models, chronological deviation, heteroscedasticity, explainability, profitability evaluation. The main goal is building an automatic system to serve ordinary investors by analyzing news and generating professional reports.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The news factorization module combines semantic role labeling (SRL) and semantic dependency parsing graph (SDPG) to extract key information from news. Can you explain in more detail how SRL and SDPG are utilized to represent the news? What are the challenges in extracting useful representations from financial news text?

2. The return forecasting module incorporates a News Effect Factor into the Fama-French 5 factor model. What is the intuition behind introducing this new factor? How is the News Effect Factor constructed and incorporated into the model? 

3. The risk assessment module employs an EGARCH model to estimate volatility and Value at Risk (VaR). Why is modeling volatility important for risk management in quantitative finance? What are the benefits of using an EGARCH model compared to a standard GARCH model?

4. The paper claims the proposed method has stronger explainability compared to previous methods. What specific aspects contribute to the improved explainability? How is explainability evaluated?

5. The experiments show improved performance over baselines in metrics like annualized returns and Sharpe ratio. What explanations are provided in the paper for why the proposed method achieves better profitability? 

6. How robust is the performance of the proposed method to changes in time period, market conditions, and stocks analyzed? Are additional experiments needed to further demonstrate generalizability?

7. Could the interpretability of the generated reports be improved further? What additional information could be incorporated to provide more actionable insights for investors?

8. How dependent is the performance on the specific large language model used for report generation? Could the approach work with other models besides ChatGPT?

9. What are limitations of the methodology? What aspects could be improved in future work to make it more practical for real-world usage?

10. The paper focuses on Chinese stocks. How could the methodology be adapted to work for other markets like US stocks? Would new models need to be trained or can it directly transfer?
