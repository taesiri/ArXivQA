# [Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation: Reassessing the Necessity of   Traditional EHR Data Imputation in Downstream Clinical Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16796)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Electronic health records (EHRs) contain a lot of missing data, making it challenging to directly apply deep neural networks for clinical prediction tasks. 
- Existing methods require imputing the missing values first before feeding to downstream models. However, imputing non-authentic data can negatively impact model performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new training protocol called "Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation" (PAI) which models the missing values using a learnable prompt vector instead of imputing missing data.

- The prompt vector is initialized randomly and inserted into the EHR data wherever there are missing values. 

- During training, the prompt vector is jointly optimized along with the parameters of the deep neural network by simply propagating the downstream task loss back through the entire model.

- This allows the model to learn a prompt vector that captures implicit patterns useful for the downstream task without having to reconstruct missing values.

Main Contributions:

- First work showing superior performance without imputation compared to traditional protocols that require imputing missing values.

- Proposes a simple and plug-and-play approach applicable to any existing EHR analysis model based on the idea of continuous prompt learning.

- Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets and models demonstrate PAI consistently improves performance across all models on both classification and regression tasks.

- Further analysis shows PAI exhibits stronger robustness against data insufficiency and high missing rates. Demonstrates better generalization capability in a simulated cross-institutional setting with non-overlapping features.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation (PAI), a new training protocol for EHR analysis models that uses a learnable prompt vector to capture model preferences for missing values instead of imputing missing data, achieving better performance without introducing non-authentic data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new training protocol called Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation (PAI) for EHR analysis without imputation. Specifically:

1) The paper reassesses the necessity of imputation in the traditional deep learning protocol for EHR analysis, arguing that introducing imputed non-realistic data can lead to issues like power loss, biased estimates, and underperforming models. 

2) To address the challenge of missing values for DNNs, the paper proposes PAI - a new protocol that models missing values by continuously optimizing a learnable prompt vector instead of imputing missing values.

3) Extensive experiments show that PAI outperforms the traditional imputation-based protocol across various EHR analysis models, tasks, and datasets. PAI also exhibits stronger robustness against data insufficiency and higher missing rates.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the PAI protocol as a new way for EHR analysis without imputation, which is shown to outperform existing imputation-based approaches. The simplicity of PAI also allows easy integration into existing DNN frameworks for EHR data.

The paper introduces a new training protocol called "Learnable Prompt as Pseudo-Imputation" (PAI) for training DNNs on EHR data with missing values, without needing traditional imputation. It shows PAI improves performance of DNN models on downstream prediction tasks like mortality outcome and length of stay prediction. It also demonstrates advantages of PAI over imputation-based methods, especially in situations of data insufficiency, high missing rates, and for model generalization with non-overlapping features across institutions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key insight and motivation behind proposing PAI as an alternative protocol to traditional imputation-based methods for EHR data? Can you explain the limitations of imputation that PAI aims to address?

2. How does PAI exactly work? Can you walk through the overall framework and key components (e.g. feature prompt, training and inference phases) in detail? 

3. Why is the feature prompt in PAI able to capture the model's preferences related to missing values without explicit supervision? What properties of neural networks enable this capability?

4. What are the benefits of optimizing the feature prompt solely based on the downstream prediction loss instead of adding auxiliary losses? Would adding other losses be counterproductive?

5. How does PAI handle variable sequence lengths across different patients? Does it require padding or truncation?

6. What initialization strategies can be used for the feature prompt? How sensitive is PAI to different initializations based on the results?

7. Why does PAI exhibit stronger robustness in situations of data insufficiency and high missing rates compared to imputation-based methods? What factors contribute to this improved robustness?

8. Why is PAI's zero-shot capability on non-overlapping features between train and test sets crucial for practical usage across healthcare systems? How significant are the gains shown?

9. What are some limitations of PAI and areas of improvement for future work that the authors discuss? Can you think of any other limitations or extensions to explore?

10. Do you think the empirical results presented conclusively demonstrate PAI's superiority over traditional imputation across models, tasks, and datasets? What further analyses could strengthen this claim?
