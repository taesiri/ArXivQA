## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:- Applying active learning to large-scale models like deep learning. Most current active learning methods are designed for conventional small models. New methods need to be developed that take into account the over-parametrization of deep learning models. The kernel method or nonparametric regression may be promising approaches.- Studying active learning with biased or non-i.i.d. initial data. Most methods assume some labeled data are available, but if these are not representative of the overall distribution, it can negatively impact learning. Methods are needed to handle biased initial data.- Combining active learning with related methods like curriculum learning and self-paced learning. There may be benefit in selecting samples in a meaningful order instead of randomly. - Using active learning for causal structure discovery and causal effect identification. Active intervention selection has been studied for causal learning, but more work is needed in this area.- Developing theoretical guarantees for active learning with complex nonparametric models. Most analysis assumes simple hypothesis spaces. New tools are needed to characterize the sample complexity of active learning in complex spaces.- Designing better stopping criteria for active learning. Most criteria are heuristics without a solid theoretical backing. Principled statistical methods based on convergence tests or validation set approaches are needed.- Expanding applications of active learning to areas like materials science, drug discovery, and medical intervention studies where it can accelerate research and reduce costs.The paper highlights many open questions around active learning theory, methods, and applications that still need to be addressed by future work.
