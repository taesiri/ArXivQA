# [Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05698)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively select good in-context examples for large language models to perform well on unseen tasks via in-context learning. The key hypothesis is that modeling the joint probability of the entire in-context example set with a conditional determinantal point process (DPP) and training it to align with the language model's preference through contrastive learning will allow selecting better sets of in-context examples compared to prior approaches.Specifically, the paper proposes a model called CEIL (Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning) that uses a conditional DPP to capture both the relevance of examples to the input and the diversity between examples. The conditional DPP is trained with a contrastive loss to learn which sets of examples are better than others based on the language model's likelihood. In summary, the main hypothesis is that learning to select good sets of diverse and relevant in-context examples in an end-to-end manner will improve in-context learning performance compared to prior heuristic or single example selection methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a new method called CEIL (Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning) for selecting good sets of in-context examples to use with large language models for few-shot learning. Specifically, the key ideas of CEIL are:- Modeling the joint probability of the entire set of in-context examples using determinantal point processes (DPPs), which allows capturing relationships between examples like diversity. This is in contrast to prior work that selected each example independently.- Training the DPP-based model using a contrastive learning objective that aligns the DPP probability with scores from the language model on how useful example sets are. - Using maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference during test time to efficiently find the best set of examples according to the learned model.The authors evaluated CEIL on a range of NLP tasks and datasets and showed it substantially outperforms prior heuristic and learned methods for in-context example selection. They also demonstrated benefits like transferability and compositionality.So in summary, the main novelty seems to be using DPPs and contrastive training to jointly model the entire set of in-context examples in a way that works well for few-shot learning with large language models. This is a departure from prior work that looked at selecting each example independently.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper introduces a new method called Compositional Exemplars for In-context Learning (CEIL) for selecting good in-context examples to enable in-context learning in large language models. Here are some key points on how it compares to other related work:- Most prior work on in-context learning example selection uses heuristic metrics like surface form similarity or individually scores each example. CEIL differs by modeling the joint probability of the entire set of examples using determinantal point processes, which allows it to capture inter-relationships and diversity between examples.- Some prior methods like EPR train an example scorer using contrastive learning, but still retrieve examples independently. CEIL trains its scoring model using a novel contrastive loss that considers pair rankings between candidate sets of examples.- CEIL shows much stronger performance compared to heuristic methods like random selection, BM25 retrieval, or BERT similarity. It also outperforms the learning-based EPR method across a range of text classification and generation tasks.- The paper demonstrates that CEIL learns to compose relevant example sets for compositional generalization tasks. It achieves strong improvements on compositional splits of semantic parsing datasets.- CEIL exhibits surprising transferability - a retriever trained on one dataset or language model can often be transferred to new ones without loss in performance. This enables more efficient applications.- The inference procedure using MAP optimization over the DPP retains efficiency and CEIL is able to select high-quality small sets of examples, enabling reduced computation compared to methods that retrieve large example sets.In summary, CEIL represents an advancement over prior work by jointly modeling the entire set of examples through an end-to-end learned scoring model. The results demonstrate stronger in-context learning performance, compositional abilities, transferability, and efficiency.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

The paper appears to present a method for selecting good examples to include in the prompt for in-context learning with large language models. The key idea is to model the entire set of examples jointly using a determinantal point process, rather than selecting each example independently, in order to capture relationships between the examples. The model is trained with a contrastive learning objective to align with the language model's preferences. In one sentence: The paper proposes a method to select a diverse yet relevant set of examples for prompting large language models using determinantal point processes and contrastive learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Exploring different prompt engineering techniques and studying what makes prompts effective for in-context learning. The authors mention prompt engineering is still more of an art than a science, and there is room for more systematic studies on what factors contribute to good prompts.- Developing methods to make in-context learning more robust and less sensitive to the selection and ordering of examples in the prompt. The performance of in-context learning can vary a lot based on small changes to the prompt, so more work is needed to stabilize in-context learning.- Applying in-context learning to more complex tasks and domains beyond the classification and question answering tasks studied in this paper. The authors suggest exploring how in-context learning could work for tasks like dialogue, summarization, translation, etc.- Studying whether and how in-context learning can acquire more systematic compositional, causal, and commonsense reasoning abilities, instead of just pattern matching. Right now in-context learning shows limited reasoning and generalization capabilities.- Developing theoretical understandings of the in-context learning process and when it is expected to succeed or fail. Much of the current analysis of in-context learning is empirical, so formal theoretical modeling could shed more light.- Exploring whether fine-tuning or gradient-based updates could complement and enhance in-context learning to acquire deeper skills. The authors suggest combining the benefits of parameter updating and in-context adaptation.- Studying whether retrievers trained on some tasks and models could transfer and generalize to new tasks and models. This could reduce the need to retrain retrievers from scratch each time.In summary, the authors highlight opportunities to better understand, improve, and extend in-context learning in future work. Key directions include prompt engineering, increasing robustness, applying to more complex tasks, improving reasoning abilities, theoretical modeling, combining with parameter updating, and enabling transfer learning.
