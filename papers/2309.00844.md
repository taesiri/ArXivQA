# [Domain Generalization via Balancing Training Difficulty and Model   Capability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00844)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we learn domain-generalizable models from one or multiple source domains that can perform well on unseen target domains?The key challenge they aim to address is the misalignment between the difficulty level of training samples and the capability of contemporarily trained models along the training process. This misalignment can lead to over-fitting or under-fitting issues and degrade the generalization performance of the models. Their proposed approach Momentum Difficulty (MoDify) tackles this challenge by dynamically balancing the difficulty of training samples with the model's capability during training. The key hypothesis is that maintaining this balance, inspired by the Flow Theory, will allow for more efficient and smoother training to learn better domain-generalizable models.In summary, the central research question is how to learn domain-generalizable models by balancing training difficulty and model capability, with the hypothesis that the proposed MoDify framework can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes MoDify, a novel momentum difficulty framework that addresses the misalignment between training sample difficulty and model capability during training. This helps mitigate overfitting and underfitting issues for better domain generalization. 2. It introduces two novel techniques - MoDify-DA and MoDify-NO - to instantiate the MoDify framework. MoDify-DA adaptively adjusts the data augmentation while MoDify-NO drops overly simple samples and postpones overly difficult samples.3. It demonstrates through extensive experiments that a simple implementation of MoDify achieves superior and consistent performance across multiple benchmarks and visual recognition tasks like semantic segmentation and object detection.In summary, this paper proposes an effective and efficient momentum difficulty framework called MoDify to balance training sample difficulty and model capability. This helps alleviate misfitting issues commonly faced during domain generalization. The proposed techniques of MoDify-DA and MoDify-NO enable the coordination of data augmentation and network training for optimal difficulty-capability alignment. Experiments validate the effectiveness and consistency of MoDify across tasks.
