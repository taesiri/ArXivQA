# [Reframing Human-AI Collaboration for Generating Free-Text Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08674)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions seem to be:

1) Are GPT-3-generated explanations preferable to crowdsourced ones in existing datasets? 

The authors compare GPT-3 explanations to human-written explanations from existing crowdsourced datasets like CoS-E, ECQA, and e-SNLI. The aim is to evaluate the relative quality of GPT-3 explanations compared to what supervised models trained on crowdsourced data could produce.

2) Can improving prompt quality improve GPT-3-generated explanations?

The authors investigate whether using higher quality prompt examples results in better GPT-3 explanations compared to using lower quality crowdsourced prompts.

3) Along what fine-grained dimensions are GPT-3-generated explanations preferred, and do these correlate with overall acceptability?

The authors conduct human studies to evaluate qualities like factuality, grammar, novelty, label support, and overall acceptability. They analyze which factors are most correlated with overall preference.

So in summary, the main research questions focus on evaluating the quality of few-shot GPT-3 explanations relative to crowdsourced data, whether prompt engineering can improve quality, and analyzing the fine-grained attributes that correlate with human judgments of explanation quality. The overarching goal is assessing the potential of LLMs for generating acceptable explanations with minimal supervision.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Demonstrating that GPT-3 can generate surprisingly competitive free-text explanations when prompted appropriately, providing an alternative to expensive crowdsourced explanation datasets.

2) Showing that the quality of GPT-3's generated explanations can be further improved by using higher quality prompt examples and by filtering the generations using a supervised acceptability model trained on human judgments. 

3) Analyzing the characteristics of GPT-3's generated explanations using fine-grained human evaluations, finding strengths in surface features like grammar but weaknesses in areas like providing novel information and justifying the label. The proposed filtering model is able to select explanations that are improved in these areas.

4) Proposing a general framework of overgenerating candidate explanations from large language models and then filtering using human acceptability judgments. This is shown to produce explanations deemed unanimously acceptable by humans more consistently than greedy decoding.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that large language models prompted appropriately can be a promising path for generating free-text explanations, especially when combined with light human oversight. The analysis also sheds light on the fine-grained attributes that constitute a high quality explanation according to human annotators.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in explainable AI:

- The focus on free-text explanation generation is fairly common in recent XAI research. Many papers have looked at training models to generate natural language explanations, often using supervised learning over human-authored explanation datasets. 

- However, this paper takes a unique approach of using large language models (LLMs like GPT-3) in a few-shot prompting setup, rather than full supervised training. Evaluating how well LLMs can generate explanations when simply prompted with a few examples is a novel contribution.

- The authors make a good point that collecting high-quality human-written explanations for full supervision is challenging and expensive. Using few-shot prompting is an interesting alternative that leverages the knowledge already contained in large pretrained models.

- The idea of generating multiple candidate explanations via sampling and then filtering for the best ones using human judgments is also novel. This is a clever way to combine the power of LLMs with human input. The supervised acceptability filter is a simple but effective idea.

- The detailed human evaluation, analyzing both overall quality and fine-grained attributes like novelty and label support, provides useful insight. This type of analysis is still not very common for free-text XAI methods in my experience. 

- The competitive results compared to human-written explanations are impressive and suggest few-shot prompting merits further study. The fact that GPT-3 can apparently produce decent explanations with minimal task-specific training is remarkable.

In summary, the focus on few-shot prompting and simple human filtering to generate free-text explanations seems unique and promising compared to prior work relying on large supervised datasets. The extensive human evaluation and analysis is also a notable contribution over much previous XAI research.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Investigating the benefits of counterfactual explanations more thoroughly. The authors note that they do not evaluate explanations counterfactually in their experiments, which may be a limitation. Further research on counterfactual vs non-counterfactual explanations could be useful.

- Incorporating additional sources of supervision signal into the training process. The authors suggest this could help improve the performance of the acceptability filter, closing the gap to the upper bound oracle. Things like reinforcement learning or human feedback during training could be explored.

- Sampling more candidate explanations per instance from the language model. The authors found performance gains from sampling just 4 additional generations per instance beyond greedy decoding. sampling even more candidates could further increase the chances of finding an acceptable explanation in the candidate set.

- Applying similar methods to other tasks and domains beyond CommonsenseQA and SNLI. The authors demonstrate the approach works for 2 NLP tasks, but further testing the generalization is needed.

- Developing better automatic evaluation metrics for free-text explanations. The authors relied heavily on human evaluation, while noting that automatic metrics often do not correlate well with human judgements of explanation quality. Progress in automatic metrics would make research in this area more efficient.

- Further analysis of what factors make an explanation acceptable to humans, and how well current models capture those factors. While the authors perform some correlation analysis, human preferences remain not fully explained, suggesting more research is needed to understand exactly what people look for in good explanations.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates using large language models like GPT-3 to generate free-text explanations for classification decisions in a few-shot manner. The authors find that with well-designed prompts, GPT-3 can produce surprisingly competitive explanations compared to human-authored ones, but still has room for improvement in providing novel information and supporting the label. To address this, they propose an overgenerate-and-filter pipeline where multiple candidate explanations are generated by sampling from GPT-3, then rated for acceptability by crowdworkers. A filter model trained on these acceptability judgments is able to select the highest quality explanations. Evaluations show the filtered explanations are preferred by humans and rate higher on informative content compared to greedy decoding, while still maintaining strong surface features like grammaticality. The work demonstrates the potential of combining large pretrained models with targeted human feedback to produce high-quality free-text explanations without large-scale annotation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method for generating free-text explanations using large language models like GPT-3. The key idea is to prompt GPT-3 with a few high-quality example explanations, and have it generate explanations in a few-shot setting. The authors find that with careful prompt engineering, GPT-3 is surprisingly competitive with human-authored explanation datasets, often generating more preferred explanations. However, GPT-3 explanations still have room for improvement on metrics like providing new information and supporting the label. 

To address this, the authors propose an overgenerate-and-filter approach. They generate multiple candidate explanations with stochastic sampling, and have humans provide binary accept/reject judgments. A filter model is trained on these labels to select the most acceptable explanation. Experiments show the filter identifies explanations humans unanimously find acceptable, and outperforms baselines. The filtered explanations are better than greedy decoding along dimensions like novelty, label support, and overall acceptability. The work provides an alternate paradigm to collecting hand-written explanations at scale.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an approach to generate free-text explanations for natural language processing task instances using GPT-3 in a few-shot manner. The authors prompt GPT-3 with a few high-quality example explanations for instances of the task, and have it generate explanations for new instances. This approach is evaluated against human-authored explanation datasets, and is found to often produce competitive explanations. To further improve the quality, the authors have GPT-3 generate multiple candidate explanations per instance, and collect binary human judgments on the acceptability of each candidate. These judgments are used to train an acceptability filter, which selects the most acceptable explanation from the candidates. The filter model incorporates features of both the instance and the explanation, and is shown to consistently select explanations deemed unanimously acceptable by human annotators.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates using large language models like GPT-3 to generate free-text explanations for tasks like commonsense QA and natural language inference. The authors find that with careful prompt design, GPT-3 can generate high quality explanations competitive with human-authored ones. However, GPT-3 on its own still struggles with some aspects like providing novel information and justifying the label. 

To address this, the authors propose an "overgenerate and filter" approach - repeatedly query GPT-3 to get multiple candidate explanations, then train a filter on human acceptability judgments to pick the best ones. Despite subjectivity in judging acceptability, the filter consistently selects better explanations than baselines. The filtered explanations are improved across axes like novelty, supporting the label, and overall acceptability.

In summary, key findings are: (i) With good prompts, GPT-3 can generate competitive explanations. (ii) Binary acceptability judgments can train a filter to select high-quality explanations. (iii) The filter improves GPT-3 generations in important areas like novelty and label justification. The work demonstrates the promise of large language models for explanation generation given careful prompting and filtering.
