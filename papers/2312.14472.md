# [Not All Tasks Are Equally Difficult: Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning   with Dynamic Depth Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) aims to learn a single policy that can accomplish multiple tasks. However, different tasks have varying difficulties and hence require different amounts of knowledge. Existing MTRL methods use a fixed routing architecture across all tasks, which is suboptimal. Easy tasks require simpler policies with fewer parameters while difficult tasks need more complex policies.  

Proposed Solution (Dynamic Depth Routing):
This paper proposes a Dynamic Depth Routing (D2R) framework, which combines a varying number of modules to handle tasks of different difficulties. D2R has two components:

1) Base Module Network: Contains multiple modules arranged in a fixed topology. Each module establishes routing connections with preceding modules based on routing probabilities. Unused modules are automatically skipped.

2) Routing Network: Generates routing probabilities for each module using the current state and task. Flexibly selects an appropriate number of modules per task based on difficulty.

Additionally, two techniques are introduced - ResRouting handles inconsistent routing between behavior and target policies in off-policy training, and Route Balancing encourages continual routing exploration for unmastered tasks.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the concept of module-level routing, allowing flexible combinations of modules into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) per task

- Proposes D2R framework to automatically determine and utilize suitable number of modules based on varying task difficulties 

- Handles off-policy training challenge with ResRouting method

- Encourages balanced routing exploration with automatic route balancing

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Meta-World benchmark with significantly improved sample efficiency

- Analysis shows D2R learns adaptive routing paths relying on task complexity

In summary, D2R is an MTRL framework that shares knowledge in a more efficient way by strategically skipping modules and determining the routing dynamically conditioned on task difficulty. The techniques also address challenges during off-policy training.
