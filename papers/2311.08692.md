## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Zooter, an efficient reward-guided routing method for ensembling large language models (LLMs). The key idea is that off-the-shelf aligned LLMs have complementary strengths and weaknesses across different domains and tasks. Zooter distills rewards from off-the-shelf reward models on a diverse training set to interpret the latent expertise of each LLM. It trains a lightweight router to distribute queries to the most suitable LLM expert during inference, avoiding the computational overhead of generating from all models. Zooter enhances the noisy reward supervision with tag-based label smoothing. Comprehensive experiments show Zooter consistently outperforms the single best LLM on average and even surpasses heavier reward model ranking baselines on diverse alignment tasks, with significantly lower computation. The results support the complementary expertise assumption for LLMs and demonstrate an efficient ensemble approach.


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes Zooter, an efficient reward-guided routing method to assemble an ensemble of large language models (LLMs). The key idea is that off-the-shelf aligned LLMs have heterogeneous expertise in different domains, so routing queries to the most suitable LLM can improve performance over using a single "best on average" model. Zooter first collects rewards from existing reward models on a diverse training query set to reveal the latent expertise of each candidate LLM. These rewards are distilled to train a lightweight router that assigns queries to the expert LLM during inference. To handle noise in the reward signal, a tag-based label enhancement method is proposed. Experiments on diverse alignment tasks demonstrate Zooter consistently outperforms the best single LLM and reward model ranking baselines while having significantly lower computational overhead. The results provide evidence for the complementary expertise of LLMs and the efficacy of reward-guided routing for efficient LLM ensembling. The proposed tag-based denoising technique also proves effective in mitigating uncertainty in reward model outputs. Overall, Zooter offers an promising approach to effectively harness the strengths of multiple LLMs in a computationally efficient manner.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Zooter, an efficient reward-guided routing method to ensemble large language models that trains a router using rewards from off-the-shelf reward models as silver supervision and shows it can achieve better performance across diverse tasks compared to individual models and reward model ranking approaches.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we efficiently ensemble multiple large language models (LLMs) to harness their complementary strengths and achieve consistently good performance across diverse tasks and domains? 

The key hypothesis is that off-the-shelf aligned LLMs have heterogeneous expertise in different areas, so intelligently routing queries to the right expert LLM can outperform using any single "best on average" LLM.

The paper proposes a method called Zooter to address this question. Zooter trains a lightweight router model to assign queries to expert LLMs, using rewards from off-the-shelf reward models as supervision. This aims to achieve strong ensemble performance while minimizing computational overhead compared to methods that rank all LLM outputs.

In summary, the paper explores efficient routing methods to effectively leverage the complementary expertise of multiple LLMs, with the central hypothesis that query routing based on reward model signals can assemble LLMs better than a single generalist model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Revisiting the complementary potential of off-the-shelf aligned LLMs and showing the effectiveness of LLM ensemble with reward model ranking.

2. Proposing Zooter, an efficient reward-guided routing method to assemble LLMs. Zooter distills rewards from off-the-shelf reward models as silver supervision to train a routing function for probing model expertise. 

3. Developing a tag-based label enhancement technique to mitigate noise from reward model uncertainty.

4. Comprehensively evaluating Zooter and other ensemble methods on 4 groups of benchmarks with 26 subsets. Results show Zooter can effectively assemble LLMs and outperforms reward model ranking methods with significantly less computation overhead.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing Zooter, an efficient routing method to assemble LLMs by learning latent expertise among models using rewards as silver supervision. Zooter shows strong performance with low computation overhead compared to reward model ranking baselines.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work in large language model ensembling:

- The main contribution of this paper is proposing an efficient reward-guided routing method (Zooter) for ensembling multiple pre-trained LLMs. This differs from prior work like LLM-Blender and Fusing-of-Experts which focus on ranking or fusing multiple LLM outputs. 

- Zooter aims to leverage the complementary strengths of different LLMs by routing queries to the most suitable expert LLM. This plays on the assumption that diverse pre-training makes LLMs expert in different domains, which is less explored compared to output fusion methods.

- For training the query router, Zooter uses reward model scores as silver supervision rather than human labels or task datasets. This is more data-efficient than supervised routing methods like in Fusing-of-Experts.

- The paper evaluates Zooter on a more comprehensive set of 26 diverse tasks compared to prior work which tends to focus on fewer natural language benchmarks. This allows better assessment of the complementary expertise assumption.

- Zooter shows efficient inference compared to ranking methods, requiring just the overhead of the router, while also achieving strong performance by specializing queries. The uplifts over the single best LLM are competitive with ranking methods.

- Limitations include reliance on reward models which can be noisy, and analysis is still needed on what makes LLMs specialized. But overall the idea and results contribute useful advances to assembling pre-trained LLMs efficiently.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel routing approach for LLM ensembling that is data-efficient and performs competitively. The evaluation across diverse tasks is more comprehensive than prior work. It provides new perspective on assumed LLM complementarity.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring the interpretation of the latent expertise and complementary skills of different LLMs. The authors mention that analyzing what makes certain LLMs perform better on specific tasks/domains could be valuable future work.

- Improving the training data and methods for the router model. The authors suggest collecting more diverse, high-quality training data to improve generalization. They also mention exploring different model architectures and training techniques for the router.

- Evaluating on a broader range of downstream tasks. The authors recognize their benchmark suite covers a limited set of domains and suggest evaluating on more diverse alignment tasks.

- Comparing to a wider range of ensemble methods. The authors suggest comparing Zooter to more ensemble approaches like generator ranking and iterative inference.

- Analysis of computation-accuracy tradeoffs. The authors propose analyzing the tradeoffs between computation cost and performance when using different ensemble strategies.

- Combining router training with further finetuning. The authors suggest finetuning the router model together with the expert LLMs could be promising.

- Mitigating noise and uncertainty in reward model supervision. The authors recognize reward noise as a challenge and propose ideas like ensemble reward models.

- Incorporating router confidence scores. The authors suggest producing confidence estimates along with router predictions could help optimize inference.

So in summary, the key directions relate to improving the router model, expanding evaluation, comparing with more methods, and analyzing tradeoffs - with a focus on better understanding model expertise.
