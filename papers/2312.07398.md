# [LLMEval: A Preliminary Study on How to Evaluate Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07398)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores three key questions related to evaluating large language models (LLMs): which criteria to use, what annotation methods to employ, and which ranking systems to utilize. The authors introduce a new dataset, LLMEval, with over 240,000 manual annotations and 57,000 automatic evaluations across 20 LLMs. They compare five evaluation criteria - accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness - finding that accuracy and informativeness best differentiate model performance while all models demonstrate strong harmlessness. The authors examine onsite, crowd-sourced, and public manual evaluations alongside GPT-4 automated scoring, discovering onsite evaluations offer superior accuracy and consistency. Comparisons reveal higher alignment between onsite annotators and GPT-4. The study also contrasts the Elo rating system and Points scoring system for rankings derived from pairwise comparisons. Significant volatility is detected in Elo ratings over long evaluations, exhibiting dependence on match orderings. Ultimately, the paper offers 10 key conclusions and insights into optimal practices for evaluating large language models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a preliminary study on evaluating large language models by comparing various criteria, annotation methods, and ranking systems through extensive experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The authors looked into the issue of "how to evaluate LLMs," comparing various criteria, different types of annotators, rating methods, and ranking approaches.

2) They introduced a new dataset called LLMEval and evaluated 20 models through both manual and automatic evaluations. 

3) From their experimental results, they drew 10 key conclusions that provide insights into evaluating LLMs in the future. These include findings on the most distinguishing evaluation criteria, the optimal manual evaluation methods, and issues with using the Elo rating system for ranking LLMs.

In summary, this paper focused on the methodology of evaluating large language models, compared different approaches, created a new benchmark dataset, and provided a set of recommendations based on their experiments for future LLM evaluations. The key contribution lies in systematically examining the question of "how to evaluate LLMs" and providing data-driven guidance.

The paper focuses on analyzing different methods and approaches for evaluating large language models, including selection of criteria, use of different types of human annotators, scoring techniques, and ranking systems. It introduces a new dataset called LLMEval and conducts experiments to compare these different evaluation settings, drawing conclusions about their relative strengths and weaknesses. Key terms like "LLM evaluation", "annotation methods", "ranking systems", etc. reflect the main themes and topics discussed in the paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares different evaluation criteria like accuracy, informativeness, etc. Why were these specific criteria chosen? Could there be other important criteria worth considering in LLM evaluation?

2. The paper employs both manual and automatic evaluation methods. What are some key differences and tradeoffs between manual vs automated LLM evaluation? When would one be preferred over the other?  

3. For manual evaluation, the paper uses onsite, crowd-sourced and public annotators. What might be some biases or limitations unique to each annotator group? How could the annotator groups complement each other?

4. The paper finds better alignment between onsite evaluation and GPT-4 judgement compared to crowd-sourced/public evaluation. Why might this be the case? What are some factors causing the discrepancy?

5. The paper identifies issues with using Elo rating for LLM evaluation like volatility and sequence dependence. Can you suggest some alternative rating systems better suited for ranking LLMs? What enhancements could make Elo rating more stable?

6. The paper indicates GPT-4 displays length bias in evaluation compared to humans. How can this bias be quantified or reduced? Are there other systemic biases in automated evaluation? 

7. The paper discovers larger gaps between human and GPT-4 judgement for subjective questions. What unique challenges exist in evaluating subjective questions? How can evaluation be enhanced for subjective tasks?

8. What are some real-world implications of the findings from this analysis - for companies developing LLMs, researchers evaluating models, end users interacting with models etc?

9. The paper performs analysis on 20 LLMs. Would some findings differ if applied to more specialized conversational or domain-specific LLMs vs general LLMs?

10. How could evaluation systems dynamically aggregate results from multiple methods like automated metrics, crowd consensus and expert opinions to gain comprehensive LLM assessment?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is important but challenging. Prior work has focused on "what" and "where" to evaluate, but less on "how" to evaluate. 

- The key questions around "how" to evaluate include:
    1) Which criteria to use for evaluation (accuracy, fluency etc)
    2) Which annotation methods to use (manual vs automatic, scoring approaches) 
    3) Which ranking systems to use to compare LLMs

Proposed Solution 
- Introduce a new benchmark dataset called LLMEval with manual and automated evaluations 
- Compare different evaluation criteria, annotator types, scoring methods and ranking systems

- Evaluation Criteria: Accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, harmlessness
- Annotators: Onsite, crowd-sourced, public, GPT-4 automated
- Scoring: Star scoring, pairwise comparisons 
- Ranking Systems: Elo system, Points system 

Key Contributions
- Find accuracy and informativeness are most differentiating criteria 
- Onsite manual evaluation has highest quality
- Automated evaluation better aligns with manual for star scoring 
- Elo rating system has stability issues for ranking

- Release dataset with 243k manual annotations and 57k automated evals
- Provide insights into optimal criteria, methods and systems for LLM evaluation

The paper makes methodological contributions around how to design evaluation benchmarks and offers practical guidelines for evaluating large language models.
