# [Rethinking Residual Connection in Training Large-Scale Spiking Neural   Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05171)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper analyzes different residual connection topologies for training large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs). Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate the limitations of connections with interblock spiking neurons that disrupt gradient flow. They find the best-performing connections can be abstracted into a densely additive (DA) form that facilitates gradient propagation. The concept is extended to other topologies, leading to the proposal of four DANet architectures that alleviate issues with gradients. On ImageNet, DANet brings substantial accuracy improvements of up to 13.24% compared to prior Spiking ResNets. The paper also provides a methodology for designing SNN topologies based on DA connections, analyzing performance on datasets of varying scales. DANet variants achieve strong results on ImageNet with low training cost. The insights on designing connections and the high-performing DANet family advance the development of large-scale SNNs.
