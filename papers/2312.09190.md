# [Efficient Online Learning of Contact Force Models for Connector   Insertion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09190)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a new approach for modeling and controlling robotic connector insertion tasks. Rather than relying on an accurate rigid-body dynamics simulator, the authors propose learning a quasi-static contact force model that predicts the forces and torques on the connector as a linear function of the configuration and applied controls. They introduce a novel Linear Model Learning (LML) algorithm to recursively estimate this model to global optimality without any matrix inversions, enabling real-time performance that is constant time on a GPU. The model is used in an optimization-based controller that smoothly inserts connectors by minimizing predicted forces from the model. This approach is validated in simulation and on hardware, using a Franka arm to successfully insert power plugs. The method enables rapid adaptation, as a 10 second calibration sequence is sufficient to learn an accurate contact model. Compared to prior connector insertion methods, this approach is fast, data-efficient, robust, and does not require explicit modeling or offline policy training.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Connector insertion tasks like plugging in cables are difficult to accurately simulate due to complex contact dynamics between connectors. Small errors can cause jamming.
- Variability between connectors also makes sim-to-real transfer challenging.
- Existing methods require lots of offline training data or task-specific tuning.

Proposed Solution:  
- Learn a quasi-static contact force model instead of a full dynamics simulator. This model predicts contact forces from the robot configuration and controls.
- Model is linear in a engineered feature vector, allowing for convex optimization-based control.
- Novel Linear Model Learning (LML) algorithm recursively solves for the globally optimal linear model. Runs in constant time on GPU, without matrix inversions.

Key Contributions:
- Validated contact force model for connector insertion tasks based on robot configuration and controls. Accurately captures forces.
- LML algorithm for fast, parallelized, and numerically stable recursive linear system ID.
- Model-based controller that uses learned model to optimize connector alignment based on predicted forces.
- Demonstrated success on connector insertion in simulation and on hardware with a Franka robot arm. Reduces insertion forces by over 80%.

Overall, the paper presents a new modeling approach for contact-rich tasks by learning a quasi-static force model. The model is used in an optimization controller to smoothly insert connectors. The LML algorithm enables efficient online learning of the model.
