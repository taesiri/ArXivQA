# [Efficient Online Learning of Contact Force Models for Connector   Insertion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09190)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a new approach for modeling and controlling robotic connector insertion tasks. Rather than relying on an accurate rigid-body dynamics simulator, the authors propose learning a quasi-static contact force model that predicts the forces and torques on the connector as a linear function of the configuration and applied controls. They introduce a novel Linear Model Learning (LML) algorithm to recursively estimate this model to global optimality without any matrix inversions, enabling real-time performance that is constant time on a GPU. The model is used in an optimization-based controller that smoothly inserts connectors by minimizing predicted forces from the model. This approach is validated in simulation and on hardware, using a Franka arm to successfully insert power plugs. The method enables rapid adaptation, as a 10 second calibration sequence is sufficient to learn an accurate contact model. Compared to prior connector insertion methods, this approach is fast, data-efficient, robust, and does not require explicit modeling or offline policy training.
