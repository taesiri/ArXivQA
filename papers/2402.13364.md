# [A Simple but Effective Approach to Improve Structured Language Model   Output for Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs have shown impressive abilities in generating free-form, unstructured text. However, their performance can be inconsistent when producing text adhering to specific structured formats (e.g. for tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE)).
- The mismatch between the unstructured data LLMs are trained on and the structured output requirements poses a challenge. Previous approaches using specialized prompts to guide structured output generation sometimes resulted in formatting issues or reduced IE performance.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper introduces an efficient method called Generate and Organize (G&O) to enhance LLMs' capabilities for structured text generation.
- G&O breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline:
   1) LLMs first generate free-form, unstructured intermediate responses identifying the requested information.
   2) LLMs then organize the intermediate responses into the desired structure (like Markdown tables), using the responses as context.
- G&O adds an additional clean-up step to remove any extraneous information from the intermediate responses before structuring to maintain output integrity.

Key Contributions:
- G&O effectively separates the generation of textual content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure on models to complete two orthogonal tasks simultaneously.
- Tested on zero-shot NER and RE, G&O significantly improves LLM performance across models with minimal additional effort.
- Ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in G&O to the overall performance gain.
- As a simple and adaptable technique, G&O can be combined with other strategies like self-consistency training to further elevate LLM capabilities on various structured text generation tasks.

In summary, the paper introduces an efficient prompting approach to enhance LLMs' structured prediction performance without extra supervision, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse models and datasets. The proposed G&O pipeline is straightforward, interpretable and versatile for integration with existing methods.
