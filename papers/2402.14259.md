# [Word-Sequence Entropy: Towards Uncertainty Estimation in Free-Form   Medical Question Answering Applications and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reliable question answering systems are critical for the medical domain, but large language models (LLMs) tend to hallucinate facts and provide biased answers. This undermines reliability.  
- Quantifying uncertainty of free-form answers from LLMs in open-ended medical QA tasks is challenging due to:
  - Unbounded solution space to search for most likely textual sequence
  - Multiple sources of uncertainty in complex LLMs (aleatoric and epistemic)
  - Issue of semantic equivalence between sequences
- Existing methods have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty for free-form medical QA.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE) to quantify uncertainty by assessing relevance at word and sequence levels
- Calibrate uncertainty proportion for each word based on semantic relevance score 
   - Score obtained via semantic textual similarity between question-answer pairs before/after removing word
- Reduce uncertainty of correlated sequences by adding relevance score to generative probability 
- Overall, assign greater uncertainty to more relevant words and sequences to mitigate bias from irrelevant words/sequences

Main Contributions:
- Characterize phenomenon of generative inequality in medical QA and implications for uncertainty estimation
- Propose WSE as first general method to quantify uncertainty of free-form answers from LLMs in medical QA 
- Extensive experiments on 5 medical QA datasets and 7 LLMs show WSE outperforms baselines for uncertainty quantification
- Apply WSE in posterior to improve model accuracy without any fine-tuning (e.g. 6.36% on COVID-QA dataset)
- Show potential of WSE for reliable medical QA systems

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations around quantifying uncertainty for free-form medical QA, by proposing a calibrated word-sequence based approach. Experiments verify superiority over prior methods, and potential to improve reliability.
