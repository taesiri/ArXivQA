# [Word-Sequence Entropy: Towards Uncertainty Estimation in Free-Form   Medical Question Answering Applications and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Reliable question answering systems are critical for the medical domain, but large language models (LLMs) tend to hallucinate facts and provide biased answers. This undermines reliability.  
- Quantifying uncertainty of free-form answers from LLMs in open-ended medical QA tasks is challenging due to:
  - Unbounded solution space to search for most likely textual sequence
  - Multiple sources of uncertainty in complex LLMs (aleatoric and epistemic)
  - Issue of semantic equivalence between sequences
- Existing methods have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty for free-form medical QA.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE) to quantify uncertainty by assessing relevance at word and sequence levels
- Calibrate uncertainty proportion for each word based on semantic relevance score 
   - Score obtained via semantic textual similarity between question-answer pairs before/after removing word
- Reduce uncertainty of correlated sequences by adding relevance score to generative probability 
- Overall, assign greater uncertainty to more relevant words and sequences to mitigate bias from irrelevant words/sequences

Main Contributions:
- Characterize phenomenon of generative inequality in medical QA and implications for uncertainty estimation
- Propose WSE as first general method to quantify uncertainty of free-form answers from LLMs in medical QA 
- Extensive experiments on 5 medical QA datasets and 7 LLMs show WSE outperforms baselines for uncertainty quantification
- Apply WSE in posterior to improve model accuracy without any fine-tuning (e.g. 6.36% on COVID-QA dataset)
- Show potential of WSE for reliable medical QA systems

In summary, the paper tackles key limitations around quantifying uncertainty for free-form medical QA, by proposing a calibrated word-sequence based approach. Experiments verify superiority over prior methods, and potential to improve reliability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE) to quantify the uncertainty of free-form answers generated by language models in open-ended medical question answering tasks by assessing the semantic relevance of words and sequences.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new method called Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE) to quantify the uncertainty of free-form answers generated by language models in open-ended medical question answering tasks. WSE calibrates the uncertainty at both the word and sequence levels based on their semantic relevance.

2. It conducts extensive experiments on 5 medical QA datasets using 7 popular pre-trained language models. The results demonstrate that WSE outperforms 6 baseline methods in accurately quantifying uncertainty. 

3. Without any task-specific fine-tuning of the language models, it shows that simply selecting the sequence with the lowest WSE uncertainty as the final answer leads to substantial improvements in model accuracy across the datasets, highlighting WSE's potential for enhancing reliability in real-world medical QA applications.

In summary, the key innovation is the WSE method for uncertainty estimation in free-form medical QA, which is shown to be effective for both uncertainty quantification and improving language model accuracy. The unsupervised approach also makes this method easy to apply in practice.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Uncertainty estimation - The paper focuses on quantifying the uncertainty of free-form answers generated by large language models in medical question answering tasks.

- Generative inequality - The paper analyzes the phenomenon where some tokens or sequences generated by LLMs carry more semantic relevance than others, creating uncertainty estimation challenges.  

- Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE) - The proposed method for calibrating uncertainty at both the word and sequence levels based on semantic relevance.

- Semantic relevance - A core concept examined in the paper, referring to the semantic information carried by words and sequences. Relevance scores are used to reweight uncertainty.

- Semantic textual similarity - Used to compute semantic relevance scores by comparing similarity of sequences with and without certain words removed.  

- Free-form medical QA - The application domain being studied, where there are no constraints on the form of questions and answers in medical queries.

- Large language models (LLMs) - The class of foundation models being used to generate free-form answer sequences in the studied QA systems.

So in summary, key terms cover uncertainty quantification, semantic relevance, the proposed WSE method, medical QA, and the use of large language models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method called Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE) for quantifying uncertainty in free-form medical question answering systems. Could you elaborate on why existing methods for uncertainty estimation are insufficient for this task and the key challenges WSE aims to address?

2. One key component of WSE is assessing the semantic relevance of words and sequences. Could you walk through the technical details on how semantic relevance is quantified in the paper, including the use of semantic textual similarity scores? 

3. The paper argues that the phenomenon of generative inequality poses challenges for uncertainty estimation in free-form medical QA. Could you explain this phenomenon and how the design of WSE specifically accounts for generative inequality?

4. WSE calibrates uncertainty at both the word and sequence levels. What is the intuition behind calibrating uncertainty at these two levels? How do the word-level and sequence-level calibrations complement each other?  

5. Could you analyze the mathematical formulation behind the proposed Word-Sequence Entropy method? In particular, walk through Equations 16-25 and how they capture the key ideas you previously discussed regarding semantic relevance and calibrating uncertainty.

6. One interesting result is that WSE improves model accuracy even without any task-specific fine-tuning of the language models. What explains this? Does it suggest uncertainty quantification could be an alternative to fine-tuning for some applications?

7. The choice of semantic similarity metrics and relevance thresholds are important design decisions in WSE. How sensitive is the performance of WSE to these choices? Could you analyze the results from the sensitivity analysis in Section 4.3?

8. For real-world application, what are some of the computational and latency limitations of implementing an uncertainty quantification method like WSE? How might these be addressed?

9. The paper focuses exclusively on the medical QA domain. Do you think the ideas behind WSE could generalize to other free-form QA domains? What adaptations might be required?

10. One direction for future work is exploring supervised approaches by fine-tuning language models to predict uncertainty. Could you discuss the potential pros and cons of supervised vs unsupervised uncertainty quantification for this task? What are your thoughts on the best direction forward?
