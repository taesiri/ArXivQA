# [Mind the gap in university rankings: a complex network approach towards   fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.1341)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Are there biases in university rankings related to the territorial context or educational mission of the universities? 2. Can these biases be quantified in terms of their impact on the ranking outcomes for each university? 3. Can a new ranking score be defined that removes/mitigates these biases to provide a fairer evaluation of university performance?The authors aim to analyze university rankings to detect territorial and educational biases, quantify their effects on university scores, and develop a new ranking approach that reduces these biases. Their main hypotheses seem to be that territorial and educational biases exist in rankings, significantly impact scores, and can be mitigated through their proposed debiasing strategy. The research questions focus on detecting, quantifying, and removing the specific biases of interest to create an improved university ranking system.
