# [Mind the gap in university rankings: a complex network approach towards   fairness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.1341)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1. Are there biases in university rankings related to the territorial context or educational mission of the universities? 2. Can these biases be quantified in terms of their impact on the ranking outcomes for each university? 3. Can a new ranking score be defined that removes/mitigates these biases to provide a fairer evaluation of university performance?The authors aim to analyze university rankings to detect territorial and educational biases, quantify their effects on university scores, and develop a new ranking approach that reduces these biases. Their main hypotheses seem to be that territorial and educational biases exist in rankings, significantly impact scores, and can be mitigated through their proposed debiasing strategy. The research questions focus on detecting, quantifying, and removing the specific biases of interest to create an improved university ranking system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It develops a methodology using complex network analysis to detect and quantify biases related to territorial context and educational offer in university rankings. The paper constructs territorial networks and educational offer networks to model similarities between universities based on these factors. 2. It analyzes two case studies - OECD universities in the Times Higher Education (THE) rankings and Italian universities in the CENSIS rankings - and finds evidence of statistically significant territorial biases in the rankings.3. It proposes a way to quantify the bias for each university through "debiasing parameters" that compare a university's performance to the average of its peers in the same territorial or educational community. 4. It develops a debiasing strategy to compute new "fairer" scores and rankings where the territorial or educational biases are substantially reduced. This is done by extracting the principal components of the distributions of debiasing parameters.5. Through the debiasing analysis, the paper is able to highlight universities that outperform their peers despite being in disadvantaged contexts. It also identifies universities where performance is below expectations given their favorable context.In summary, the main contribution is developing a data-driven methodology based on complex network analysis to detect, quantify, and remove biases in university rankings related to territorial and educational factors. The proposed debiasing strategy provides a way to make the rankings fairer and highlight exceptional performers.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper develops a method using complex networks to detect and quantify biases in university rankings related to territorial context and educational offerings, in order to define fairer, more equitable rankings.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on university rankings and territorial biases:- It takes a novel network science approach to detecting and quantifying biases, rather than relying solely on statistical regression methods like most prior work. Constructing explicit networks of university similarity allows the authors to use techniques like community detection and assortativity analysis.- The geographical resolution is higher than most prior studies, since the analysis looks at subnational regions for OECD universities rather than just countries. This provides more granular insights into how local conditions impact rankings.- The paper develops a new debiasing strategy to generate fairer rankings, going beyond just detecting biases. Using the network communities as peer groups, they compute debiasing parameters and principal components to identify universities that outperform expectations.- The scope is more comprehensive than most work, analyzing both international and national university systems (OECD and Italy). Many previous papers focus only on global rankings or a single country. - It incorporates multiple rankings (THE and CENSIS) across overall scores and disciplinary dimensions like teaching, research, employability etc. Looking at multiple rankings provides a more robust characterization of biases.- The Italian case study provides unique evidence of a strong north-south divide bias absent in the OECD analysis. This highlights how national and regional contexts can produce different bias patterns.Overall, the multi-faceted network approach, debiasing methodology, and comparative scope offer valuable advances over most previous research on the topic. The paper demonstrates how complex network sciences can lend new insights into understanding ranking biases.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors of this paper suggest several potential future research directions:- Investigating how much the advantageous features of a territory are determined by the presence of an outstanding university. The authors state that this question requires additional data and analysis methods, and represents an interesting area for future work. - Applying the debiasing approach developed in this paper to other university ranking systems besides THE and CENSIS, to see if similar territorial biases exist. - Extending the analysis to universities in non-OECD countries, to understand if the territorial bias manifests differently in developing regions.- Incorporating additional layers of networks beyond territorial and educational offer similarity, such as research collaboration networks, to capture other dimensions that may impact university rankings. - Developing interactive visualizations and tools to allow stakeholders to explore how rankings change under different debiasing approaches and parameters.- Designing optimized algorithms to detect communities and quantify bias in university networks, improving on the existing methods.- Using the knowledge of territorial bias to design evidence-based policies for performance-based funding allocation to universities, to ensure a fairer distribution of resources.- Applying complex network techniques more broadly to detect and mitigate biases in other evaluation systems beyond universities.In summary, the authors propose both extending this methodology to new datasets and ranking systems, as well as building on the network-based debiasing approach itself through novel algorithms, visualizations, and policy impacts. Their techniques offer promising directions for fairer, context-aware evaluation.
