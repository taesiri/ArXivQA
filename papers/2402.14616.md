# [The Impact of Word Splitting on the Semantic Content of Contextualized   Word Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper investigates the impact of word splitting (into subwords) on the quality of contextualized word representations derived from pre-trained language models like BERT. Specifically, it examines two key questions: (1) What is the best strategy to combine subword embeddings into a representation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that are split? (2) How does the quality of representations for split words compare to non-split in-vocabulary words?

Methodology:
The authors evaluate representations on semantic similarity tasks, both inter-word (between two words) and within-word (between contexts of the same word). They create a dataset called SplitSim for inter-word similarity with a balanced number of split and non-split word pairs. For within-word, they use the WiC dataset. They experiment with different pooling strategies for combining subword embeddings of split words: averaging (AVG), weighted averaging (WAVG), and using longest subword (LNG). They also evaluate modifications like the FLOTA tokenizer and CharacterBERT.

Key Findings:
- AVG works best overall for combining subword embeddings of split words.  
- Quality of split word representations is often worse than non-split words, but depends on word type. Split polysemous nouns are better represented than non-split ones.  
- Similarity scores tend to be higher for split word pairs versus non-split pairs. This affects correlation calculations.
- Number of subwords doesn't clearly affect representation quality. More subwords can sometimes improve results.
- Aligning splitting with morphology improves quality versus splitting word roots.
- Within-word similarity is affected by word form differences for split words.

Main Contributions:
- New inter-word semantic similarity dataset SplitSim with balanced split/non-split pairs
- Extensive analysis showing effect of splitting on representation quality
- Guidelines for using split word representations: choose AVG pooling, use appropriate layers, interpret similarities cautiously
- Demonstration that splitting words, while convenient for OOV words, can negatively impact representation quality

The paper provides useful insights and resources for working with contextualized word representations from subword-based models like BERT. It clearly highlights the inherent challenges introduced by splitting words and provides both empirical findings and practical recommendations to address them.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper analyzes the impact of word splitting on the quality of contextualized word representations extracted from language models, finding that split-word representations are often of lower quality than non-split words, but that depends on word type, with split polysemous nouns better represented than non-split ones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper's main contribution is an intrinsic evaluation and analysis of the quality of contextualized word representations derived from language models for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that have been split into subwords, compared to representations of in-vocabulary words. Specifically:

- They create a new dataset called SplitSim for evaluating semantic similarity of representations of split words vs non-split words.

- They evaluate different strategies for pooling/combining subword representations into word-level representations of OOV words, finding that averaging works best overall. 

- They analyze the quality of similarities estimated using representations of split words compared to non-split words, finding that split words are often, but not always, worse. Quality depends on word type.

- They uncover several other interesting findings related to split words, like: similarities between two split words tend to be higher than between two non-split words; performance doesn't necessarily decrease when words are split into more subwords; best layers differ across split types; etc.

So in summary, the main contribution is an analysis focused specifically on contextualized representations of OOV split words, evaluating their quality via an intrinsic semantic similarity task.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Contextualized word representations - The paper focuses on analyzing representations derived from pre-trained language models like BERT.

- Word splitting/segmentation - Refers to the tokenization process that splits words into subword units like WordPiece or BPE. The paper examines the impact of this on representation quality. 

- Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words - Words that are segmented into subwords because they do not exist in the model's vocabulary. The paper compares OOV and in-vocabulary words.

- Lexical semantic similarity - The paper relies on semantic similarity tasks and datasets to evaluate the quality of representations.

- Split-words vs full-words - Split-words refer to OOV words made up of multiple subwords. Full-words have a single dedicated token.

- Pooling strategies - Different ways to combine subword representations into one representation for a split-word, like averaging or using the longest subword.

- Word frequency - An important factor examined in the paper, as split-words tend to be lower frequency.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with analyzing contextualized representations, the impact of word splitting procedures, comparison of OOV and in-vocabulary words, evaluation through semantic similarity tasks, and factors like pooling strategies and word frequency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper compares different strategies for obtaining a single vector representation for words segmented into multiple subwords (split-words), such as averaging and using the longest subword. Why do you think the averaging strategy tended to work best overall? What are some potential drawbacks of the other strategies?

2. The paper finds that the quality of split-word representations is often worse than non-split words, except for polysemous nouns. Why might polysemous noun representations benefit from being split? How might the subwords help capture different meanings? 

3. The paper notes that split-words benefit more from BERT's contextualization process across layers compared to non-split words. Why might this be the case? What role does context play in disambiguating subwords that can be part of many different words?

4. The results show that contrary to intuition, splitting words into more subword tokens does not necessarily decrease representation quality. What might explain this counterintuitive finding? How could having more subwords potentially help capture semantics?

5. The paper introduces a new dataset, Split-Sim, balanced across split-types. What were the limitations of existing datasets that motivated creating this new resource? How is it designed to facilitate analysis of split-word representations?

6. The paper finds that split-words with incorrect morphological segmentation obtain worse similarity estimates. Why is segmentation that aligns with morphology beneficial? Does this confirm findings from previous work?

7. The paper notes different ranges of similarity values across split-types - how might this impact interpretation and comparison? Do you have suggestions for adaptations to enable comparison across split-types?

8. The paper analyzes impact of word frequency on split vs non-split word representations. Why is frequency relevant? How do the findings differ when controlling for frequency vs normal conditions?

9. The paper finds differences in optimal layers to use across split-types. Why might different transformations across BERT layers benefit split vs non-split words differently? 

10. The paper includes both inter-word and within-word similarity experiments. What differing conclusions can be drawn from these two experimental setups? How do the findings align or differ?
