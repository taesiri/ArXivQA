# [The Impact of Word Splitting on the Semantic Content of Contextualized   Word Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14616)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
This paper investigates the impact of word splitting (into subwords) on the quality of contextualized word representations derived from pre-trained language models like BERT. Specifically, it examines two key questions: (1) What is the best strategy to combine subword embeddings into a representation for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that are split? (2) How does the quality of representations for split words compare to non-split in-vocabulary words?

Methodology:
The authors evaluate representations on semantic similarity tasks, both inter-word (between two words) and within-word (between contexts of the same word). They create a dataset called SplitSim for inter-word similarity with a balanced number of split and non-split word pairs. For within-word, they use the WiC dataset. They experiment with different pooling strategies for combining subword embeddings of split words: averaging (AVG), weighted averaging (WAVG), and using longest subword (LNG). They also evaluate modifications like the FLOTA tokenizer and CharacterBERT.

Key Findings:
- AVG works best overall for combining subword embeddings of split words.  
- Quality of split word representations is often worse than non-split words, but depends on word type. Split polysemous nouns are better represented than non-split ones.  
- Similarity scores tend to be higher for split word pairs versus non-split pairs. This affects correlation calculations.
- Number of subwords doesn't clearly affect representation quality. More subwords can sometimes improve results.
- Aligning splitting with morphology improves quality versus splitting word roots.
- Within-word similarity is affected by word form differences for split words.

Main Contributions:
- New inter-word semantic similarity dataset SplitSim with balanced split/non-split pairs
- Extensive analysis showing effect of splitting on representation quality
- Guidelines for using split word representations: choose AVG pooling, use appropriate layers, interpret similarities cautiously
- Demonstration that splitting words, while convenient for OOV words, can negatively impact representation quality

The paper provides useful insights and resources for working with contextualized word representations from subword-based models like BERT. It clearly highlights the inherent challenges introduced by splitting words and provides both empirical findings and practical recommendations to address them.
