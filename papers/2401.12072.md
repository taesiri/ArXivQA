# [Cross-lingual Transfer Learning for Javanese Dependency Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12072)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Javanese is a low-resource language with over 80 million speakers, but has scarce NLP resources and prior work. 
- Recent work has created a small gold standard Javanese dependency parsing dataset, but current parsing performance is low (77.08% UAS, 71.21% LAS) due to lack of training data.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL) with Universal Dependencies treebanks to improve Javanese dependency parsing.
- TL pre-trains on one source language then fine-tunes on Javanese. HTL pre-trains on one source language, fine-tunes on Indonesian as intermediate language, then fine-tunes again on Javanese.
- Use self-attention encoder, graph-based decoder model architecture. Compare static (fastText) and contextual (BERT) word embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- First study of Javanese dependency parsing using TL and HTL. HTL gives 10% UAS/LAS increase over baseline.  
- Analysis of best source languages (Indonesian, Italian) and word embeddings (fastText) for Javanese parsing TL/HTL.
- Error analysis shows labeling differences between source and Javanese cause some errors, despite accuracy gains from TL/HTL.

In summary, the paper leverages cross-lingual transfer learning to significantly improve low-resource Javanese dependency parsing over baseline methods, providing analysis of optimal training approaches. Key limitations are no hyperparameter tuning and small intermediary language set for HTL.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes transfer learning and hierarchical transfer learning methods to improve Javanese dependency parsing, achieving over 10% higher accuracy compared to training from scratch.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Provide the first study of Javanese dependency parsing using transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL) strategies. The paper reports that the HTL method can significantly improve performance compared to training from scratch, with an increase of 10% for both UAS and LAS evaluations.

2. Report the investigation of which source language and word embedding performs best for the TL and HTL strategies. The paper compares different source languages recommended by LangRank as well as different word embeddings like fastText, Javanese BERT, Javanese RoBERTa, and multilingual BERT.

So in summary, the main contributions are introducing and evaluating TL and HTL strategies for improving Javanese dependency parsing, which is low-resource, as well as comparing different source languages and word embeddings to find the best performing ones.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Javanese language - The focus of the paper is on improving dependency parsing for Javanese, which is a low-resource language spoken by over 80 million people.

- Dependency parsing - The paper focuses specifically on dependency parsing, which involves structurally representing sentences by connecting words through labeled dependency relations.

- Transfer learning - The main techniques explored in the paper are transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL), which involve transferring knowledge from high-resource source languages to improve parsing in the low-resource Javanese language.

- Universal Dependencies - The treebanks used in the research are from the Universal Dependencies dataset, which provides annotated resources for syntax across many languages.

- Encoder-decoder model - The parsing model architecture is based on a self-attention encoder and graph-based decoder.

- Evaluation metrics - Performance is evaluated using standard dependency parsing metrics like Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) and Labeled Attachment Score (LAS).

- Low-resource languages - The paper situates itself in the context of improving NLP for low-resource languages through transfer learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes two learning strategies: transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL). Can you explain in detail the difference between these two strategies and how the knowledge transfer happens in each one?

2. The paper uses Indonesian as an intermediary language in the HTL strategy. What is the rationale behind choosing Indonesian specifically? What characteristics make it a good intermediary language for transferring knowledge to Javanese?

3. The encoder used in the model is a self-attention encoder. Why is this encoder architecture suitable for transfer learning compared to other encoder types like CNN or RNN? How does it help facilitate transfer of knowledge?

4. The paper compares several word embeddings like fastText, Javanese BERT, etc. Can you analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using static vs contextualized word embeddings in this transfer learning scenario? Which one is better suited and why?

5. The decoder uses a graph-based maximum spanning tree algorithm to predict the final parse tree. Explain how this algorithm works and why a graph-based decoding approach is preferred over a transition-based one.

6. The paper conducts an error analysis between the from-scratch, TL and HTL models. Analyze some of the common error types and explain why the errors persist even after transfer learning.

7. The HTL strategy only uses 1 intermediary language. Do you think using multiple intermediate languages can further improve performance? Explain the challenges associated with multi-hop knowledge transfer.  

8. The parser model has not been tuned for optimal hyperparameter values. Discuss the major hyperparameters involved and how you would go about tuning them to maximize end task performance.

9. The paper does not perform cross-validation on the Javanese dataset. Critically analyze how this could affect the reported scores and reliability of the overall conclusions.

10. The paper compares against a simple baseline UDPipe model. How can the experimental setup be strengthened further through comparison with other recent state-of-the-art dependency parsers?
