# [Soliro -- a hybrid dynamic tilt-wing aerial manipulator with minimal   actuators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05110)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents the design, modeling, control, and experimental validation of Soliro, a novel tilt-wing aerial robot capable of both efficient fixed-wing forward flight and nearly omnidirectional, overactuated rotary-wing flight using a minimal set of actuators. The key innovation is the unification of hybrid VTOL concepts with thrust-vectoring aerial manipulators. Soliro uses its existing arm-tilting servos to tilt the wings for forward flight while repurposing them as thrust vectoring actuators for omnidirectional flight. Through wind tunnel experiments and outdoor flight tests, the authors demonstrate the efficacy of Soliroâ€™s novel wing design and control allocation scheme to achieve the diverse flight modes. The system is able to fly steadily at 10 m/s in fixed-wing mode with approximately 30% less power consumption compared to hovering rotary-wing flight. The fast differential wing tilting enables sufficient controllability in both flight modes without the need for additional control surfaces. The experiments confirm the value of the aerodynamic modeling and control architecture in creating a large, unified flight envelope across the different modes. Overall, Soliro provides an elegant solution for combining efficiency and versatility in a minimalist hybrid aerial platform.
