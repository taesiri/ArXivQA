# [Uncertainty in Additive Feature Attribution methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17446)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores various issues related to uncertainty in post-hoc additive feature attribution methods for explainable AI (XAI). It first defines uncertainty in XAI and benchmarks four popular methods (LIME, KernelSHAP, BayesLIME, CXPlain) on uncertainty quantification metrics. It finds significant uncertainty in feature attributions across methods. Next, it analyzes the relationship between a feature's attribution and its uncertainty, finding little correlation. To address this, the authors propose a modification to LIME's sampling that reduces uncertainty of top features by over 10\% without added computation. In studying uncertainty variation across a classifier's feature space, the paper coins the term "stable instances" for points with near-zero uncertainty and develops an algorithm to effectively identify them. Finally, the work finds that more complex models exhibit higher explanation uncertainty inherently. Consequently, the authors devise a measure of model complexity that strongly correlates with uncertainty levels, which could help set tighter confidence bounds in sampling densities for methods like LIME. Together, the proposed techniques would meaningfully reduce uncertainty, helping improve trustworthiness and reliability of XAI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper explores uncertainty in additive feature attribution explainable AI methods by benchmarking algorithms, reducing uncertainty of top features, identifying stable instances with low uncertainty, and relating model complexity to explanation uncertainty.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It benchmarks the performance of 4 different XAI algorithms (LIME, KernelSHAP, BayesLIME, and CXPlain) on 5 uncertainty quantification metrics over two datasets. This allows for a comparison of the uncertainty exhibited by popular explanation methods.

2. It proposes a modification to the multivariate sampling function of LIME to achieve around 10% reduction in uncertainty of the top attributes, without increasing computational cost. 

3. It coins the term "stable instances" for instances that show near-zero uncertainty across executions of the explanation algorithm. It also proposes an algorithm to mine such stable instances.

4. It finds that the complexity of the underlying blackbox model correlates with the explanation uncertainty - more complex models exhibit higher uncertainty. It proposes a cardinality-based metric to approximate model complexity, which could be incorporated in sampling densities of perturbation-based XAI methods.

In summary, the paper focuses on quantifying, reducing, and understanding uncertainty in additive feature attribution methods through experiments and proposed modifications. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
