# [LLMCRIT: Teaching Large Language Models to Use Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Humans use criteria to judge the quality of task completion, but current AI models do not effectively leverage comprehensive criteria when providing feedback. This limits the helpfulness of model-generated feedback.

- Two main challenges exist: (1) criteria are often implicit in guidelines rather than explicit, (2) the large number of criteria makes it difficult for models to properly apply them.

Proposed Solution:
- A new framework called LLMCrit that teaches large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language feedback using comprehensive criteria extracted from task guidelines. 

- Uses a model-in-the-loop approach to: (1) semi-automatically extract atomic criteria from guidelines, (2) construct demonstrations for each criterion showing how to apply it.

- Provides the extracted criteria and demonstrations to LLMs to guide their feedback generation process.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes the new task of "teaching LLMs to use criteria" for helpful feedback generation.

- Introduces the LLMCrit framework for semi-automatically deriving criteria/demonstrations from guidelines and using them to enhance LLM feedback.

- Evaluates LLMCrit on 3 writing tasks: scientific papers, Python code, Reddit posts. Proposes layered metrics to effectively evaluate quality of feedback.

- Experiment results provide insights into the effects of criteria and demonstrations on feedback, and suggest that providing criteria alone efficiently improves feedback quality.

- Releases extracted criteria and demonstrations for the 3 tasks to support future research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called LLMCrit that teaches large language models to generate helpful, criteria-based feedback on writing tasks by semi-automatically extracting guidelines into criteria and crafting demonstrations, aiming to provide scalable oversight.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new framework called \frameworkname for teaching large language models (LLMs) to use criteria to generate helpful natural language feedback on task execution. The framework involves semi-automatically deriving criteria from task guidelines and constructing demonstrations for each criterion.

2. Instantiating the framework on three real-world writing tasks - scientific paper writing, Python code writing, and Reddit post writing. 

3. Proposing layered evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated feedback from different perspectives: validity, contextualization, constructiveness, and helpfulness.

4. Experiment results that provide insights into the effects of incorporating criteria and demonstrations into the context when teaching LLMs to generate feedback, as well as the impact of providing criteria at different levels of granularity.

5. Releasing 83 criteria and 332 demonstrations collected and curated for the three writing tasks to facilitate future research.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a general framework to teach LLMs to use comprehensive criteria to generate helpful feedback on task execution, along with an instantiation on three writing tasks and an extensive evaluation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Large language models (LLMs)
- Criteria 
- Feedback generation
- Writing tasks (e.g. scientific paper writing, Python code writing, Reddit post writing)
- Model-in-the-loop 
- Guidelines
- Demonstrations
- Evaluation metrics (validity, contextualization, constructiveness, helpfulness)
- Teaching strategies (providing criteria, demonstrations, both)

The paper proposes a framework called LLMCrit for teaching large language models to generate helpful, criteria-based feedback on various writing tasks. The key ideas involve leveraging writing guidelines to semi-automatically extract evaluative criteria and construct demonstrations showing how to apply those criteria. Experiments on three real-world writing tasks reveal insights into effective strategies for guiding LLMs to produce higher-quality, criteria-aligned feedback. The proposed evaluation methodology examines feedback quality along four progressive dimensions, spanning validity, contextualization, constructiveness, and overall helpfulness. So those are some of the central concepts and terms featured throughout this paper.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a model-in-the-loop framework called LLMCrit to teach large language models (LLMs) to use criteria for feedback generation. Could you elaborate on why a model-in-the-loop approach was chosen rather than a fully automated approach or a fully manual approach? What are the advantages and limitations?

2. The paper extracts criteria from existing writing task guidelines semi-automatically. Could you walk through the process in more detail? What role does the LLM play and what role does human expertise play in deriving good criteria? 

3. The paper creates in-context demonstrations for each criterion to teach the LLM how to apply that criterion. What considerations went into designing effective demonstrations? How were the demonstration inputs created to capture diverse violations of criteria?

4. The framework generates feedback by providing the LLM with the writing input, criteria, and demonstrations. Could you explain the reasoning behind this approach? Why is it important to condition the LLM on all three elements?

5. The paper proposes layered evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated feedback from different perspectives. What was the motivation behind this hierarchical evaluation strategy? What are the limitations of evaluating only the final helpfulness?

6. What experiments were conducted to evaluate LLMCrit? What were some key findings about the effects of incorporating criteria and demonstrations? How did results vary across models and tasks?

7. The analysis section examines the impact of providing criteria at different granularities. What did this analysis reveal about the trade-offs in terms of efficiency and overall performance? 

8. What limitations does the LLMCrit framework currently have? What aspects could be improved or expanded on in future work? Are there other writing tasks or components of writing that could benefit?

9. The paper releases collected criteria and demonstrations for three writing tasks. In what ways could this data facilitate future research at the intersection of LLMs, criteria, and feedback generation?

10. What ethical considerations arise from developing LLMs capable of generating feedback based on criteria? Could the framework potentially be misused or have unintended societal consequences? How might risks be mitigated?
