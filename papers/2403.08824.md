## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of computational approaches for analyzing non-typical emotions of stress, depression, and engagement for mental health applications. 

The paper first highlights the importance of analyzing non-typical emotions compared to basic emotions, as non-typical emotions have gained importance due to their impact on mental health. The complex and subjective nature of non-typical emotions poses challenges for traditional analysis methods, advocating computational approaches that rely on objective data analysis and pattern recognition.

The paper then presents a comprehensive taxonomy of computational approaches for non-typical emotion analysis, encompassing emotion categories, input modalities like visual, physiological, audio, and textual data, types of machine learning and deep learning approaches, and mental health applications. Further, an in-depth overview of commonly used datasets for stress, depression, and engagement analysis is provided, along with a discussion of associated challenges like multimodal data integration and data labeling issues.

Subsequently, the generic framework and phases of computational emotion analysis approaches are outlined, covering data collection, preprocessing, model training and evaluation. The state-of-the-art advancements are described next, highlighting innovations in stress, depression and engagement analysis using multimodal fusion, attention mechanisms, and transfer learning approaches to boost model accuracy. Performance summaries of state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets are also presented. 

The paper further explores the mental health applications facilitated by computational analysis of non-typical emotions. These span areas like occupational wellbeing, mental disorder detection, elderly care, education, gaming, and policy-making. Additionally, emerging directions and open challenges are identified, including acquiring large datasets, enhancing model generalization, ensuring dynamic emotion analysis, and improving model transparency.

In summary, this is the first survey providing collective insights into computational analysis of stress, depression and engagement. It offers a structured taxonomy, reviews evolution of traditional and advanced techniques, provides performance analysis of state-of-the-art, and maps applications as well as emerging trends and challenges to shape future mental health solutions.
