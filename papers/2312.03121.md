# [Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: There is a need for robust and principled evaluation schemes for comparing general AI agents across multiple tasks. Popular methods like Elo ratings and Nash averaging have limitations like inability to handle non-transitive relationships and sensitivity to clones. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a framework called Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) that leverages concepts from social choice theory and voting schemes to evaluate general agents. The key ideas are:

- Map the evaluation problem to a voting scheme by treating tasks/games as voters and agents as alternatives. Voters provide ordinal rankings or pairwise preferences over agents.

- Aggregate preferences across voters (tasks) using a voting rule to produce overall assessment of agents. Interpret voting rules as social welfare functions.

- Voting rules satisfy desired properties like Condorcet-consistency, clone-consistency, population consistency. This provides principled evaluation with clear tradeoffs.

Main Contributions:

- VasE framework that adapts social choice theory for evaluation of general agents

- Analysis of consistency properties and their implications 

- Evaluation of VasE across reinforcement learning, language models and human games

- Identification of maximal lotteries as satisfying key properties, efficiently computable, and able to identify cycles

- Proposal of iterative maximal lotteries that produces interpretable "levels"

- Examples where VasE is more robust than Elo or Nash averaging

Key Benefits:
- Handles non-transitivity, clone-robustness
- Flexible weighting of tasks
- No need for cross-task score normalization
- Interpretable and transparent


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes the use of computational social choice theory for the evaluation of general agents, including reinforcement learning agents, language models, and human players, through a framework called Voting as Evaluation (VasE).


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Presentation of a framework (VasE) for adapting computational social choice to the evaluation of general agents. 

2) A characterization of relevant consistency properties and their effects on the evaluation of general agents.

3) Analysis of the findings of VasE on three different evaluation domains: reinforcement learning, large language models, and human competitions.

4) An iterative variant of the maximal lotteries voting scheme that produces a full ranking of agents: a game-theoretic method that repeatedly solves two-player zero-sum margin games as represented by the voter margin matrix.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel framework for evaluating general agents across multiple tasks or environments based on principles from social choice theory and voting schemes. It analyzes this framework on several domains and introduces an iterative extension to the maximal lotteries voting method.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with it are:

- Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE): The proposed framework for adapting computational social choice methods to evaluate general agents.

- Social choice theory: The field focused on aggregating preferences and making collective decisions that provides the foundation for VasE. 

- Voting methods: Specific techniques like scoring rules, Condorcet methods, and maximal lotteries that are used to aggregate preferences in VasE.

- General agents: The systems, whether machine learned models or humans, that are being evaluated by VasE across multiple tasks. 

- Evaluation: The overall process of assessing the performance of agents, which VasE aims to make more robust, interpretable, and flexible.

- Consistency properties: Axioms like Condorcet consistency, clone consistency, population consistency that voting schemes can satisfy and make them suitable for evaluation.  

- Reinforcement learning: One domain VasE is applied to, using Atari game scores and adaptive agents as case studies.

- Language models: Another domain VasE is used for - evaluating the capabilities of large language models across diverse benchmarks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the Voting-as-Evaluation method proposed in the paper:

1. The Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) method maps the evaluation of AI agents to voting theory concepts. Could you elaborate on the key mappings made, especially between agents, voters, alternatives, and the aggregation function? How does this enable leveraging decades of research in social choice theory?

2. The paper identifies several desirable properties when evaluating general AI agents, including Condorcet consistency, population consistency, and clone consistency. Could you explain each of these properties in more detail and why they are relevant in the evaluation context? 

3. One argument made is that VasE does not require score normalization across tasks, only ordinal rankings within each task. Could you discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of avoiding cross-task normalization? When might normalization still be preferred?

4. The paper analyzes maximal lotteries as a particularly useful voting scheme for evaluation. Could you explain how maximal lotteries works, what key properties it satisfies, and why it emerges as an interesting method from both game-theoretic and social choice perspectives?

5. An iterative method called Iterative Maximal Lotteries is introduced. How does this method work? What does the number of levels convey about the evaluation results? How do you interpret an agent's score value?

6. The empirical evaluation considers RL agents, large language models, and human game players. Could you summarize one key insight or observation made in each of these domains when applying VasE? How did the findings here differ from applying Elo or Nash averaging?

7. The paper identifies adversarial task selection as an issue with Nash averaging. Could you explain this phenomenon and why it occurs? What are its implications? How does VasE avoid this issue?

8. What modifications would be needed to apply VasE to settings with stochastic evaluations, like offline RL batch datasets? What voting schemes could handle — or take advantage of — stochasticity? 

9. The paper focuses on the Agent-vs-Task setting more than Agent-vs-Agent. How difficult is it to extend game-theoretic evaluation schemes like Nash averaging to environments with large numbers of agents? What limitations emerge?

10. Could you propose ways to extend VasE to do evaluation over time as agents improve, gracefully handle testing variations, or convey uncertainty estimates over produced rankings? Which social choice concepts might be relevant for these scenarios?
