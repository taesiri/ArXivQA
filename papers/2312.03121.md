# [Evaluating Agents using Social Choice Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03121)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: There is a need for robust and principled evaluation schemes for comparing general AI agents across multiple tasks. Popular methods like Elo ratings and Nash averaging have limitations like inability to handle non-transitive relationships and sensitivity to clones. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes a framework called Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) that leverages concepts from social choice theory and voting schemes to evaluate general agents. The key ideas are:

- Map the evaluation problem to a voting scheme by treating tasks/games as voters and agents as alternatives. Voters provide ordinal rankings or pairwise preferences over agents.

- Aggregate preferences across voters (tasks) using a voting rule to produce overall assessment of agents. Interpret voting rules as social welfare functions.

- Voting rules satisfy desired properties like Condorcet-consistency, clone-consistency, population consistency. This provides principled evaluation with clear tradeoffs.

Main Contributions:

- VasE framework that adapts social choice theory for evaluation of general agents

- Analysis of consistency properties and their implications 

- Evaluation of VasE across reinforcement learning, language models and human games

- Identification of maximal lotteries as satisfying key properties, efficiently computable, and able to identify cycles

- Proposal of iterative maximal lotteries that produces interpretable "levels"

- Examples where VasE is more robust than Elo or Nash averaging

Key Benefits:
- Handles non-transitivity, clone-robustness
- Flexible weighting of tasks
- No need for cross-task score normalization
- Interpretable and transparent
