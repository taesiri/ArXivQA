# [A &amp; B == B &amp; A: Triggering Logical Reasoning Failures in Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthrough capabilities, including the ability to "reason". However, evaluating reasoning skills in LLMs remains challenging. Existing benchmarks focus on accuracy rather than directly assessing reasoning processes. Although some studies have developed metrics to evaluate reasoning, they suffer from data leakage or limited scope.  

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces LogicAsker, an automatic framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' formal reasoning abilities based on a comprehensive set of 30 atomic skills from propositional and predicate logic. LogicAsker systematically generates reasoning questions by converting logic expressions into natural language. It calculates LLM accuracy on each skill to identify weaknesses. The test cases can further construct demonstration examples to improve reasoning via in-context learning.

Main Contributions:
- Formally defines 30 atomic skills an LLM should have for formal reasoning based on fundamental logic systems 
- Develops LogicAsker to automatically generate test cases under these skills and provide insights into LLM capacities
- Empirically evaluates six widely used LLMs and demonstrates LogicAsker can effectively uncover reasoning failures from 25% to 94%
- Shows test cases from LogicAsker can improve LLM reasoning abilities through in-context learning (e.g. 10% for GPT-4)
- Releases all code, data and results to facilitate future research

In summary, this paper develops a comprehensive and automatic framework to evaluate and enhance formal reasoning skills in LLMs based on fundamental logic systems. Extensive experiments on major LLMs demonstrate its ability to effectively identify weaknesses and improve reasoning performance.

2. It develops LogicAsker, an automated tool that can generate test cases to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities under those skills, identify the weaknesses of LLMs, and create prompts based on the test results to improve the reasoning performance of LLMs through in-context learning.

3. It performs a comprehensive empirical evaluation of six widely used LLMs, including commercial models like GPT-3, ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard and open-source models. The results show that LogicAsker can effectively trigger reasoning failures in these LLMs and improve their reasoning abilities.

The paper introduces LogicAsker, an automated framework to evaluate and improve the logical reasoning abilities of large language models under a defined set of atomic skills. It leverages propositional logic and predicate logic to formally characterize reasoning and generates test cases to reveal failures in LLMs' reasoning capacities. The test cases are then used to identify weaknesses and construct demonstrations for in-context learning to enhance the models' reasoning skills. The effectiveness of LogicAsker is evaluated on several widely used LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. LogicAsker defines a set of 30 atomic skills and 208 extended skills that a language model should possess for formal reasoning. What are some of the key considerations and trade-offs in defining this skill set? Is it comprehensive enough to evaluate all aspects of reasoning?

2. The test case generation module converts logical expressions into natural language questions. What techniques does it use for this conversion and how extensible is this approach to handle more complex logical expressions? 

3. Weakness identification calculates accuracy metrics to reveal model weaknesses. Are there any other metrics that could provide additional insights? How can the accuracy results be further analyzed to pinpoint specific gaps in reasoning skills?

4. For in-context learning demonstrations, how are the examples selected and crafted to effectively improve particular weaknesses in reasoning? What makes these demonstrations more impactful than random examples?

5. The evaluation uses accuracy on test cases as the key metric for reasoning ability. Are there any risks or limitations with using accuracy alone to measure reasoning skills? What other evaluation techniques could complement this?

6. Could the test generation approach scale to much larger skill sets encompassing more complex reasoning tasks? What enhancements would be needed?

7. Beyond accuracy improvements, what other dimensions of reasoning ability improvement does the in-context learning bring about qualitatively? 

8. How sensitive are the weakness identification results and reasoning accuracy to the hyperparameters used for test case generation and prompt formulation?

9. The reasoning skills are defined within propositional and predicate logic systems. How can the approach be extended to evaluate informal, commonsense reasoning abilities?

10. What customizations would be required to apply LogicAsker to specialized conversational AI models focused on particular domains rather than general capabilities?
