# [Mark My Words: Analyzing and Evaluating Language Model Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00273)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and benchmark for evaluating watermarking techniques that can trace machine-generated text outputs. It introduces metrics for efficiency, quality, and tamper-resistance, and tests four major watermarking schemes from prior literature across realistic generation tasks. Key findings are that existing techniques are ready for deployment, with schemes able to watermark outputs in under 100 tokens with minimal quality loss. It also challenges the necessity of indistinguishability, showing that directly modifying token distributions can improve efficiency without degrading quality. The benchmark quantifies trade-offs between metrics under different parameter settings, with the distribution-shift scheme being most tunable, and provides attack analysis demonstrating 30-50\% robustness against paraphrasing for the best schemes. Overall, it demonstrates the capability of current watermarks while providing analysis and recommendations to inform practical applications. The benchmark and analysis aim to facilitate consensus on best practices for watermarking language models.
