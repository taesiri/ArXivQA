# [ReAGent: A Model-agnostic Feature Attribution Method for Generative   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00794)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing feature attribution methods (FAs) have mostly focused on encoder-only language models for text classification tasks. It is unclear if they can be faithfully applied to decoder-only models for text generation due to differences in model architecture and task settings. 
- There is no single best-performing FA across models and tasks. Evaluating different FAs is computationally expensive, especially for large models. Some FAs are not applicable to black-box models without access to internal weights.
- No prior work has proposed a model-agnostic FA specifically for decoder-only generative language models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent), a model-agnostic FA for generative language models. 
- ReAGent recursively updates the token importance scores by replacing random subsets of tokens in the input context with RoBERTa predictions and measuring the change in predictive likelihood for the next token. Larger likelihood changes indicate higher importance of replaced tokens.
- The method meets stopping criteria when replacing top unimportant tokens still allows correct prediction of the target token.

Main Contributions:
- ReAGent works for any generative LM without needing access to internal weights or gradients. It can be applied even to black-box models.
- Experiments across 6 decoder LMs on 3 text generation datasets show ReAGent is consistently more faithful than 7 existing FAs.
- ReAGent shows greater advantage for tasks with contextual hints and for OPT vs GPT model family. It effectively identifies helpful context tokens. 
- ReAGent minimizes compute required as it only relies on forward passes without retaining gradients.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ReAGent, a model-agnostic feature attribution method for generative language models that recursively updates token importance scores by measuring probability distribution changes when replacing context tokens, and shows it is consistently more faithful than existing methods across models and tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing ReAGent, a model-agnostic feature attribution method for text generation tasks. Specifically:

- ReAGent does not require accessing the model internally and can be easily applied to any generative language model.

- The paper empirically shows that ReAGent is consistently more faithful than seven popular feature attribution methods by conducting experiments covering three tasks and six language models of varying sizes from two different model families. 

- ReAGent does not need to retain gradients for computing input importance, but only relies on forward passes, minimizing memory footprint and compute required.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing ReAGent as a model-agnostic, consistently more faithful feature attribution method for text generation tasks, which is efficient in terms of compute and memory requirements.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Feature attribution methods (FAs)
- Generative language models 
- Encoder-only language models
- Decoder-only language models
- Text generation tasks
- Model agnostic
- Faithfulness metrics
- Soft-Sufficiency (Soft-NS)
- Comprehensiveness (Soft-NC) 
- Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent)
- Input importance distribution
- Hellinger distance
- Model families (GPT, OPT)

The paper proposes ReAGent, a new model-agnostic feature attribution method for evaluating the faithfulness of importance scores on text generated by decoder-only language models. It compares ReAGent against several other popular methods across different models and datasets, using Soft-NS and Soft-NC as the main evaluation metrics. The key focus is on developing a method that can work across models and does not require access to internal weights or gradients.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent) as a model-agnostic feature attribution method for generative language models. Can you explain in more detail how ReAGent recursively updates the token importance scores? What is the intuition behind this recursive update process?

2. ReAGent replaces a randomly selected subset of tokens from the input context with predictions from RoBERTa at each recursive step. Why is RoBERTa used for generating the replacement tokens instead of random tokens from the vocabulary? What would be the potential issues with using random replacement tokens? 

3. The paper evaluates ReAGent on three text generation datasets - LongRA, TellMeWhy, and WikiBio. Can you summarize the key differences between these datasets and why they were chosen? How do the results demonstrate that ReAGent is more faithful across different tasks?

4. Soft-Sufficiency and Soft-Comprehensiveness are used as faithfulness evaluation metrics. How are these metrics adapted to work with generative language models instead of just encoder models? What change was made to handle the high dimensionality of output tokens?

5. Besides being model-agnostic, what are some of the other advantages of ReAGent compared to other feature attribution methods? Does it require gradient computation or model fine-tuning? How does this help with practical applicability?

6. The results show that there is no single best-performing feature attribution method across all models and datasets. Why do you think this is the case? What differences exist between model architectures that might impact how faithfully a method captures feature importance?

7. One finding is that ReAGent shows a greater advantage over other methods on the LongRA dataset. What characteristic of this dataset might lead to better performance compared to the other two datasets?

8. How sensitive is the performance of ReAGent to changes in hyperparameters like the ratio of replaced tokens, maximum steps, and the stopping condition? Should certain hyperparameter settings be preferred?

9. Could the evaluation approach used in this paper be extended to other types of generative models besides decoder-only models, such as encoder-decoder models or diffusion models? What changes would need to be made?

10. The paper analyzes token-level and sequence-level faithfulness results separately. What trends can be observed in how different feature attribution methods perform at the token vs sequence level? How does ReAGent compare?
