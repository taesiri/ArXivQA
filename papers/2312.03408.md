# [Open-sourced Data Ecosystem in Autonomous Driving: the Present and   Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03408)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This comprehensive survey provides a systematic overview of autonomous driving datasets and data engines. It categorizes existing datasets into two generations - the first focused on perception with simple sensors and small-scale data, while the second incorporates more complex sensors, larger-scale diverse data, and expanded tasks beyond just perception. The survey analyzes over 70 datasets and introduces a novel metric to evaluate impact and importance. It also summarizes data engines from industry leaders, covering data collection, labeling, quality control, simulation, and automated labeling with foundation models. Finally, inspired by trends in natural language processing and computer vision, the survey proposes objectives and essential components for next-generation autonomous driving datasets. These include sensor coverage, data scale/diversity, flexibility for new paradigms like end-to-end learning, and incorporation of reasoning abilities. Overall, this paper delivers an in-depth analysis of the past, present, and future landscape of datasets and data engines critical for advancing autonomous driving technologies.
