## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with multiple IRSs serving ground users. The key goal is to maximize system energy efficiency by jointly optimizing user-IRS association, UAV trajectories, successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding orders, and power allocation over time. To solve this challenging problem, the authors propose an Alternating algorithm based on Inverse soft-Q Learning and succEssive convex approximation (AISLE). Specifically, AISLE consists of three main steps: (1) An inverse soft-Q learning algorithm is used to optimize the dynamic association between users and IRSs; (2) The UAV trajectories are optimized by leveraging Dinkelbach and successive convex approximation methods; (3) A penalty-based successive convex approximation method optimizes the SIC decoding orders and power allocation. Furthermore, convergence and complexity analyses are provided for AISLE. Simulation results demonstrate that AISLE significantly outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of system energy efficiency and average effective throughput under various settings. The results also show the performance gains achieved by AISLE in IRS-assisted UAV communication systems with dynamic user association and trajectory optimization.
