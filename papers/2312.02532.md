# [DRAFT: Dense Retrieval Augmented Few-shot Topic classifier Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02532)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes DRAFT, a framework for few-shot topic classification across diverse topics. DRAFT first uses a dense retriever model and a multi-query retrieval algorithm to construct a customized dataset using just a few text examples related to a topic. It then fine-tunes a classifier on this dataset to identify texts belonging to that topic. Experiments were conducted on widely used classification benchmarks and 291 manually constructed diverse topic datasets. Results showed that DRAFT achieved competitive or better performance compared to large language models like GPT-3 175B and InstructGPT 175B despite having 177 times fewer parameters. The key capabilities highlighted are: constructing customized datasets for arbitrary topics using retrieval, accommodating multiple queries as input to the retriever via the proposed multi-query retrieval algorithm, and achieving strong few-shot classification performance across diverse topics. Limitations mentioned include the need for automated generation of negative queries and resolving topic ambiguity in some automatically constructed datasets. Overall, the simple but effective DRAFT framework shows promise for real-world few-shot topic classification applications.
