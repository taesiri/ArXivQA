# [DRAFT: Dense Retrieval Augmented Few-shot Topic classifier Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02532)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes DRAFT, a framework for few-shot topic classification across diverse topics. DRAFT first uses a dense retriever model and a multi-query retrieval algorithm to construct a customized dataset using just a few text examples related to a topic. It then fine-tunes a classifier on this dataset to identify texts belonging to that topic. Experiments were conducted on widely used classification benchmarks and 291 manually constructed diverse topic datasets. Results showed that DRAFT achieved competitive or better performance compared to large language models like GPT-3 175B and InstructGPT 175B despite having 177 times fewer parameters. The key capabilities highlighted are: constructing customized datasets for arbitrary topics using retrieval, accommodating multiple queries as input to the retriever via the proposed multi-query retrieval algorithm, and achieving strong few-shot classification performance across diverse topics. Limitations mentioned include the need for automated generation of negative queries and resolving topic ambiguity in some automatically constructed datasets. Overall, the simple but effective DRAFT framework shows promise for real-world few-shot topic classification applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes DRAFT, a framework that uses a dense retriever to construct a customized dataset from a few topic examples as queries, then fine-tunes a classifier on this dataset to perform few-shot topic classification across diverse topics, achieving competitive performance compared to large language models while using significantly fewer parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The proposal of DRAFT, a simple but effective framework for few-shot topic classification. DRAFT uses a dense retriever model to construct a Customized dataset from a few query examples of a target topic, and then fine-tunes a classifier on this dataset.

2) The introduction of the Multi-Query Retrieval (MQR) algorithm that allows the retriever model to handle multiple queries simultaneously when constructing the Customized dataset. This is different from existing retrieval-augmented methods that only handle a single query.

3) Extensive experiments showing that DRAFT achieves competitive or superior performance to large language models like GPT-3 and InstructGPT with over 175B parameters, despite having 177 times fewer parameters. The experiments are conducted on both widely used classification benchmarks as well as 291 manually constructed diverse topic datasets.

4) Analysis showing the efficacy and potential of DRAFT for few-shot topic classification, as well as discussion of directions for further improvement such as incorporating negative queries, expanding to multi-class classification, and deployment for real-world applications.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and empirical validation of the DRAFT framework for effective few-shot topic classification across a diverse range of topics.

Key aspects examined include one-class classification on diverse topics, the use of negative queries to improve performance, and multi-class classification on benchmark datasets. Overall, the key focus is on developing an effective yet parameter-efficient approach to few-shot topic classification that can generalize to real-world scenarios.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces a new algorithm called Multi-Query Retrieval (MQR) for handling multiple queries in the dense retriever model. Can you explain in more detail how MQR works and how it determines the threshold $\cos(\theta)$? 

2. One of the key components of the DRAFT framework is constructing the Customized dataset using the dense retriever model. Can you elaborate on the strategies explored to build an optimal Customized dataset? How sensitive is the performance of DRAFT to the quality of this dataset?

3. The paper demonstrates that DRAFT achieves strong performance on topic classification tasks. Can you discuss the intrinsic properties of DRAFT that make it well-suited for specifically topic classification versus other classification tasks? 

4. Negative queries are shown to enhance the performance of DRAFT. What approaches were explored for automatically generating negative queries rather than relying on manual input? How effective were they?

5. The choice of Data Collection that serves as the knowledge source for the retriever model significantly impacts DRAFT's performance. What considerations went into selecting the appropriate Data Collection for the experiments in this paper?

6. The number of queries and the subspace size are described as the most crucial hyperparameters. Can you elaborate on how these parameters were tuned? What values worked best? 

7. For real-world deployment, the paper mentions the need for parameter-efficient learning to effectively manage classifier weights for new topics. What specific methods were explored to address this challenge?

8. Could the DRAFT framework be extended to other tasks beyond classification, such as open-domain question answering? What modifications would be required?

9. The paper demonstrates competitive performance compared to LLMs with far fewer parameters. Can you analyze the computational efficiency and inference latency advantages of DRAFT over these foundation model baselines?

10. What enhancements or modifications could make the DRAFT framework more robust and improve its capability to handle emerging topics with limited labeled data?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a growing need to classify arbitrary topics in texts, such as monitoring content on social media or generated by AI systems. 
- Existing topic classification methods rely on benchmark datasets with a limited set of topics and do not address real-world scenarios with diverse, long-tail topics.
- Few-shot classification can work with limited labeled data but existing methods cannot do one-class classification for arbitrary topics.
- Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning can classify topics with few examples but require extremely large models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes DRAFT, a framework for few-shot topic classification using a dense retriever to construct a Customized dataset from a few query examples of a topic.  
- It uses a Multi-Query Retrieval algorithm to handle multiple query examples simultaneously to retrieve relevant passages from a knowledge source to build the Customized dataset.
- A classifier is then fine-tuned on this Customized dataset to identify the topic.

Main Contributions:
- DRAFT provides an effective way to create a topic classifier from limited topic examples, enabling classification of diverse real-world topics.
- First framework to use a dense retriever for few-shot classification. 
- Introduces a Multi-Query Retrieval algorithm to handle multiple query examples.
- With only millions of parameters, DRAFT achieves competitive or better performance compared to LLMs with billions of parameters on few-shot topic classification.
- Evaluated on 291 diverse topics and benchmark datasets, demonstrating wide applicability.

In summary, DRAFT contributes a simple but highly effective approach using dense retrieval and fine-tuning to perform few-shot classification on arbitrary topics with limited labeled data.
