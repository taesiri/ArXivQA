## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scale Decoupled Distillation":

Problem:
Existing logit-based knowledge distillation methods suffer from inferior performance compared to feature-based methods. This is because they only leverage the global logit output which couples semantic information from multiple classes, transferring ambiguous knowledge to the student and misleading its learning. 

Solution - Scale Decoupled Distillation (SDD):
1) Performs multi-scale pooling on the logit maps to obtain local logit outputs corresponding to different regions of the input image. This helps capture finer-grained and unambiguous semantic knowledge.

2) Further divides the decoupled logit outputs into consistent terms (same class as global output) and complementary terms (different class). Consistent terms transfer multi-scale knowledge of corresponding classes while complementary terms preserve sample ambiguity.

3) Increases weight of complementary term loss to make student focus more on ambiguous samples and improve discrimination ability.

4) Final loss performs distillation between all local and global logit outputs to transfer comprehensive knowledge from teacher to student.

Main Contributions:
1) Identifies limitation of existing logit distillation due to coupling of knowledge in global logit output.

2) Proposes SDD method to decouple global logit into local logits and establish distillation pipelines, transferring finer-grained unambiguous knowledge.

3) Divides knowledge into consistent and complementary parts that transfer semantics and sample ambiguity respectively. Increasing weight of latter improves student's discrimination ability.

4) Experiments show SDD is effective across wide teacher-student pairs, especially for fine-grained classification tasks. Computationally efficient.
