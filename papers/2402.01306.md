# [KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01306)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO), rely on paired preference data which is scarce and expensive to collect. This limits their scalability and usage in real-world systems. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a new human-aware loss function called Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) which only relies on binary feedback indicating whether a model output is desirable/undesirable. This type of data is far more abundant and cheaper to collect. 

KTO is derived from prospect theory's model of how humans make decisions under uncertainty. It directly maximizes the perceived utility of generations using a value function that captures cognitive biases like loss aversion.

Contributions:
- Framing of existing alignment methods like DPO and PPO as human-aware losses (HALOs) that model human biases. Experiments show HALOs outperform non-HALOs.

- Introduction of KTO loss which only needs binary desirable/undesirable judgments. Matches or exceeds DPO performance across 1B-30B parameter scales despite weaker signal.

- Demonstrates KTO's robustness to extreme label imbalances and ability to work with non-preference data. Can handle up to 90% fewer desirable examples than DPO.

- Provides theoretical analysis explaining KTO's surprising effectiveness - e.g. implicitly handles noisy/intransitive preferences better than DPO.

The fact that KTO matches DPO performance while relying on cheaper data makes it very promising for scalable LLM alignment. It also opens up new possibilities for using abundant synthetic signals.
