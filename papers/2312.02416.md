# [Towards Fast and Stable Federated Learning: Confronting Heterogeneity   via Knowledge Anchor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02416)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Federated learning suffers from performance degradation and convergence issues when dealing with heterogeneous (non-IID) client data. Recent works have shown that this is caused by catastrophic forgetting of certain classes during local client training. However, a comprehensive understanding of which classes suffer from forgetting and what factors influence this is still lacking.  

Key Observations:
- Missing classes and non-dominant classes (those with few samples per client) experience severe catastrophic forgetting during local training. In contrast, dominant classes (those with many samples) improve in performance.  
- For non-dominant classes, reducing the number of samples has little effect on forgetting. However, for dominant classes, when samples are reduced below a threshold, catastrophic forgetting suddenly occurs. 

These observations indicate that local models struggle to effectively utilize the limited samples of non-dominant classes to prevent forgetting.

Proposed Solution - Federated Knowledge Anchor (FedKA):
- Construct a minimal shared dataset with one sample per class. 
- In each local training round, construct a "knowledge anchor" dataset containing the shared samples for missing classes and randomly selected samples for non-dominant classes.
- Use this knowledge anchor to regularize local training to preserve performance on missing and non-dominant classes. This is done by minimizing the L2 distance between the knowledge anchor logits from the global and local models.

Main Contributions:
- Provides further analysis showing catastrophic forgetting in federated learning is isolated to missing and non-dominant classes.
- Proposes FedKA method to mitigate this via knowledge anchors to preserve performance on problematic classes.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness to heterogeneity factors.

The key insight is that a few anchor samples can guide local models to better preserve knowledge on classes with limited data. FedKA provides an efficient and effective approach to leverage this to address key issues in federated learning on heterogeneous data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a federated learning algorithm called Federated Knowledge Anchor (FedKA) that utilizes a minimal shared dataset to mitigate catastrophic forgetting of non-dominant and missing classes during local training on heterogeneous data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It provides further analysis of catastrophic forgetting in federated learning, demonstrating that forgetting only affects missing and non-dominant classes during local training, while the performance of dominant classes improves. It also shows that clients struggle to utilize the few samples of non-dominant classes to combat forgetting.

2. It proposes an efficient algorithm called Federated Knowledge Anchor (FedKA) to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting on heterogeneous data. FedKA utilizes a "knowledge anchor" containing representative samples for missing and non-dominant classes to correct gradients and mitigate forgetting during local training. 

3. It conducts extensive experiments to evaluate FedKA, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness on popular benchmarks compared to existing methods.

In summary, the key contribution is the analysis of class-wise forgetting phenomena in federated learning on heterogeneous data, and the proposal of a novel and effective FedKA algorithm to address this issue.

The paper proposes a new federated learning algorithm called Federated Knowledge Anchor (FedKA) to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting on heterogeneous data. Key ideas include analyzing class-wise forgetting, identifying missing and non-dominant classes that suffer from more severe forgetting, constructing a "knowledge anchor" to preserve knowledge about those classes, and using the anchor to correct gradients during training to mitigate forgetting. The goal is to improve model convergence, accuracy, and robustness in the federated setting with non-IID heterogeneous data across clients.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes constructing a "knowledge anchor" to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in federated learning. What is the intuition behind using a minimal representative sample set as an "anchor point" for knowledge preservation? How does this specifically help with non-dominant and missing classes?

2. When constructing the knowledge anchor, the paper selects one random sample to represent each non-dominant class. Did the authors experiment with different strategies for choosing the representative sample, such as hardest or most proficient? What were the differences?

3. How does the knowledge anchor specifically correct the gradients during local training? Walk through the mathematics behind the additional loss term and how it encourages preserving knowledge of non-dominant/missing classes. 

4. Theoretically analyze why dominant classes tend to improve while non-dominant classes experience catastrophic forgetting during local training. What specifically causes this phenomenon?  

5. Why can't local models effectively utilize the limited samples they have to prevent forgetting of non-dominant classes? What underlying issue causes this?

6. Compare and contrast the difference between catastrophic forgetting in continual learning vs. federated learning. What distinguishes catastrophic forgetting at the class level vs. task level?

7. What challenges are there in providing a theoretical analysis of why the knowledge anchor is effective? What foundations would need to be laid for such an analysis?

8. When reducing samples of a dominant class, why does catastrophic forgetting suddenly occur below a certain threshold? Analyze what might happen during training to cause this.

9. How could generative models be used to create synthetic knowledge anchors? What are the advantages and challenges of using synthesized data?

10. For future work, how could the concept of a knowledge anchor be expanded or adapted to other federated learning scenarios such as vertical federated learning or personalized federated learning?
