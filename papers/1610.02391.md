# Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based   Localization

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we produce visual explanations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are class-discriminative and high-resolution?The key points are:- The paper proposes Grad-CAM, a technique to generate visual explanations from CNN-based models that highlights class-discriminative image regions.- Grad-CAM can be applied to a wide variety of CNN architectures without requiring changes to the model. This allows explaining off-the-shelf CNN models including those for image classification, captioning, VQA, etc.- Grad-CAM produces coarse localization maps highlighting important image regions for a target concept. - To get high-resolution visualizations, Grad-CAM is combined with existing pixel-space gradient visualization techniques like Guided Backpropagation. This gives Guided Grad-CAM visualizations.- The visual explanations are evaluated to be class-discriminative, high-resolution, and help establish trust and identify dataset biases.In summary, the key research question is how to produce visual explanations from CNNs that are class-discriminative and high-resolution, which Grad-CAM addresses by generating visualizations that are both high-resolution and discriminative for a target concept.

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing Grad-CAM, a class-discriminative localization technique to generate visual explanations for convolutional neural network (CNN) models without requiring any architectural changes or re-training. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN-based architectures like VGG, ResNets, etc.2. Introducing Guided Grad-CAM which combines Grad-CAM visualizations with existing high-resolution methods like Guided Backpropagation to get visualizations that are both high-resolution and class-discriminative. 3. Showing the applicability of Grad-CAM to various vision tasks - image classification, captioning, VQA, including complex models like ResNets. The visualizations provide insights into model failures, biases, and robustness.4. Evaluating localization ability, faithfulness, and class-discriminativeness of Grad-CAM through quantitative experiments like pointing game and human studies. Grad-CAM outperforms existing methods.5. Identifying important neurons using Grad-CAM and combining with neuron names to provide textual explanations. 6. Demonstrating the usefulness of Grad-CAM visual explanations through experiments - identifying dataset biases, evaluating trust in models, analyzing adversarial examples.7.
