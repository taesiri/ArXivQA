# [Masked Spiking Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01208)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we combine the energy efficiency benefits of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with the high performance of the Transformer architecture using self-attention?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By leveraging the ANN-to-SNN conversion method and introducing a novel random spike masking technique, it is possible to develop a spiking Transformer model that achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to prior SNN models, while also reducing energy consumption.

In particular, the paper proposes a Masked Spiking Transformer (MST) model and a Random Spike Masking (RSM) method to reduce redundant spikes and power consumption during inference after ANN-to-SNN conversion. The central goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNNs and ANNs while improving the energy efficiency of SNNs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper seem to be:

1. Proposing a Masked Spiking Transformer (MST) framework that combines spiking neural networks (SNNs) and Transformers using ANN-to-SNN conversion. 

2. Introducing a Random Spike Masking (RSM) method to reduce redundant spikes and power consumption during inference while maintaining accuracy.

3. Evaluating the proposed MST model on static image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and neuromorphic datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art SNN models.

4. Demonstrating the effectiveness of the RSM method in reducing power consumption in the self-attention and MLP modules of the Transformer, as well as other SNN models like ResNet and VGG.

5. Providing analysis and visualizations (attention maps) to understand the effects of different masking ratios on model accuracy and attention.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a high-performance yet energy-efficient Spiking Transformer framework by combining ANN-to-SNN conversion and a spike masking technique, along with extensive experiments validating its effectiveness. The MST model and RSM approach offer a promising direction for developing efficient SNNs that can match ANN performance.
