# [Masked Spiking Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01208)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we combine the energy efficiency benefits of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with the high performance of the Transformer architecture using self-attention?

The key hypothesis appears to be:

By leveraging the ANN-to-SNN conversion method and introducing a novel random spike masking technique, it is possible to develop a spiking Transformer model that achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to prior SNN models, while also reducing energy consumption.

In particular, the paper proposes a Masked Spiking Transformer (MST) model and a Random Spike Masking (RSM) method to reduce redundant spikes and power consumption during inference after ANN-to-SNN conversion. The central goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNNs and ANNs while improving the energy efficiency of SNNs.
