# [Is Open-Source There Yet? A Comparative Study on Commercial and   Open-Source LLMs in Their Ability to Label Chest X-Ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Radiology report labeling is currently an expert-driven, labor-intensive task limiting the scale of medical AI studies. Using large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract labels from free-text reports could enable larger-scale studies.
- Most existing work has focused on commercial models like GPT-4 which have drawbacks: privacy concerns from sending data to cloud APIs, costs from pay-per-use, and reproducibility issues from model changes.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare open-source LLMs to GPT-4 for radiology report labeling on two chest x-ray datasets: an institutional dataset of 540 reports and the public ImaGenome dataset of 500 reports.  
- Models tested: Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.
- Evaluate models on 4 (ImaGenome) or 13 (institutional) findings using zero-shot and few-shot prompting.

Key Contributions:
- Open-source models can match or exceed the performance of task-specific models like CheXbert and rule-based systems like CheXpert-labeler.
- With few-shot prompting, an ensemble of Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-70B and QWEN1.5-72B matches the performance of GPT-4 on the institutional dataset (Micro F1 0.971 vs 0.973).
- Open-source models offer advantages in cost, privacy, reproducibility over commercial alternatives like GPT-4.
- Demonstrates the viability of open-source LLMs for unstructured to structured text transformations in medicine.

In summary, this paper shows that with few-shot prompting, open-source LLMs can labeling radiology reports as accurately as GPT-4 while avoiding issues with privacy, cost and reproducibility. This enables larger-scale medical studies than previously feasible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper compares commercial LLMs like GPT-4 to open-source models on classifying chest x-ray reports, finding that with techniques like ensembling and few-shot learning the open-source models can approach or match GPT-4's performance while offering advantages like lower cost and better privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is comparing the performance of open-source generalist large language models (LLMs) like Llama, Mistral and QWEN to commercial models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the task of classifying chest x-ray reports. Specifically, the authors show that with techniques like ensemble modeling and few-shot prompting, open-source LLMs can match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4 on this radiology report classification task. This demonstrates that open-source models are a viable alternative to commercial models for medical natural language processing applications, offering advantages like lower cost, improved privacy and reproducibility. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of freely available LLMs for clinical text processing tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. This paper compared several open-source LLMs to GPT-4. What were the key advantages and disadvantages highlighted between using an open-source model versus a proprietary commercial model like GPT-4 for the task of radiology report labeling?

2. The paper used two datasets - one from ImaGenome and one institutional dataset. What were the key differences between these datasets in terms of size, label creation methodology, findings covered etc.? How did the model performance vary across datasets?

3. Both zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques were used in this study. Explain in detail the process followed for few-shot prompting on both datasets. How many examples were used and what was the strategy for choosing them? 

4. The prompts provided to the models were identical across models. What are some potential limitations of using identical prompts in this setup? Could prompt engineering specific to each model have led to better performance?

5. The paper proposed using an ensemble of open-source models. Explain how this ensemble model was created. What were the constituent models and why were they chosen? How did the ensemble model perform compared to the best individual model and GPT-4?

6. There was significant variation in model performance across different findings/labels. Analyze the reasons behind poor performance for certain labels like "consolidation" and "pneumonia" across models. 

7. The paper highlights generative nature of LLMs as a potential problem for classification tasks. Elaborate on this issue using a relevant example from the results. How can this problem be mitigated?

8. Apart from model performance, analyze the computational resource requirements for running the different models experimented with. How does that factor into feasibility of adopting them for large scale labeling tasks?

9. The prompts used in this study were created based on trial and error on a development set. Propose an alternative methodology for systematically creating optimal prompts for this task.  

10. The paper focuses only on radiology reports. Discuss how the findings might generalize or differ across other types of medical reports like pathology, progress notes etc. and other modalities like MRI.
