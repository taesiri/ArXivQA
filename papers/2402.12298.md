# [Is Open-Source There Yet? A Comparative Study on Commercial and   Open-Source LLMs in Their Ability to Label Chest X-Ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12298)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Radiology report labeling is currently an expert-driven, labor-intensive task limiting the scale of medical AI studies. Using large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract labels from free-text reports could enable larger-scale studies.
- Most existing work has focused on commercial models like GPT-4 which have drawbacks: privacy concerns from sending data to cloud APIs, costs from pay-per-use, and reproducibility issues from model changes.

Proposed Solution:
- Compare open-source LLMs to GPT-4 for radiology report labeling on two chest x-ray datasets: an institutional dataset of 540 reports and the public ImaGenome dataset of 500 reports.  
- Models tested: Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.
- Evaluate models on 4 (ImaGenome) or 13 (institutional) findings using zero-shot and few-shot prompting.

Key Contributions:
- Open-source models can match or exceed the performance of task-specific models like CheXbert and rule-based systems like CheXpert-labeler.
- With few-shot prompting, an ensemble of Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-70B and QWEN1.5-72B matches the performance of GPT-4 on the institutional dataset (Micro F1 0.971 vs 0.973).
- Open-source models offer advantages in cost, privacy, reproducibility over commercial alternatives like GPT-4.
- Demonstrates the viability of open-source LLMs for unstructured to structured text transformations in medicine.

In summary, this paper shows that with few-shot prompting, open-source LLMs can labeling radiology reports as accurately as GPT-4 while avoiding issues with privacy, cost and reproducibility. This enables larger-scale medical studies than previously feasible.
