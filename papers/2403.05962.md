# [Multi-Robot Communication-Aware Cooperative Belief Space Planning with   Inconsistent Beliefs: An Action-Consistent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) is important for reliable autonomy, where each robot maintains a belief over the environment state and reasons about future belief evolution for different actions.
- Existing MR-BSP approaches assume consistent beliefs between robots, requiring extensive communication. This is often infeasible. 
- Inconsistent beliefs can lead to lack of coordination and dangerous decisions. Addressing MR-BSP with inconsistent beliefs is an open problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage concept of "action consistency" - same action is best regardless of objective function values. Extend this to multi-robot case.
- Develop decentralized algorithm "EnforceAC" that identifies if consistent decision making can be guaranteed despite inconsistent beliefs. 
- Robot reasons about 1) its own perspective 2) other robot's perspective 3) its perspective reasoned by other robot. Same best joint action -> action consistency.
- If action consistency cannot be guaranteed, algorithm self-triggers communication of necessary information.

Main Contributions:  
- Formulate new problem of MR-BSP with inconsistent beliefs between robots
- Develop novel approach to address it using action consistency, ensuring eventual identification of consistent joint action
- Algorithm self-triggers communication only when needed to achieve action consistency
- Provide theoretical guarantee that approach will find consistent joint action
- Demonstrate approach reduces communications by 30-40% on search and rescue experiments

In summary, the paper addresses the open challenge of multi-robot belief space planning with inconsistent beliefs through a novel decentralized algorithm based on reasoning about action consistency. The approach can often coordinate robots without communication and self-triggers communication only when needed, with strong theoretical guarantees.
