# [Multi-Robot Communication-Aware Cooperative Belief Space Planning with   Inconsistent Beliefs: An Action-Consistent Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05962)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) is important for reliable autonomy, where each robot maintains a belief over the environment state and reasons about future belief evolution for different actions.
- Existing MR-BSP approaches assume consistent beliefs between robots, requiring extensive communication. This is often infeasible. 
- Inconsistent beliefs can lead to lack of coordination and dangerous decisions. Addressing MR-BSP with inconsistent beliefs is an open problem.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage concept of "action consistency" - same action is best regardless of objective function values. Extend this to multi-robot case.
- Develop decentralized algorithm "EnforceAC" that identifies if consistent decision making can be guaranteed despite inconsistent beliefs. 
- Robot reasons about 1) its own perspective 2) other robot's perspective 3) its perspective reasoned by other robot. Same best joint action -> action consistency.
- If action consistency cannot be guaranteed, algorithm self-triggers communication of necessary information.

Main Contributions:  
- Formulate new problem of MR-BSP with inconsistent beliefs between robots
- Develop novel approach to address it using action consistency, ensuring eventual identification of consistent joint action
- Algorithm self-triggers communication only when needed to achieve action consistency
- Provide theoretical guarantee that approach will find consistent joint action
- Demonstrate approach reduces communications by 30-40% on search and rescue experiments

In summary, the paper addresses the open challenge of multi-robot belief space planning with inconsistent beliefs through a novel decentralized algorithm based on reasoning about action consistency. The approach can often coordinate robots without communication and self-triggers communication only when needed, with strong theoretical guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents a decentralized algorithm EnforceAC that self-triggers communication only when necessary to find consistent joint actions for multi-robot belief space planning problems with inconsistent beliefs about the environment state.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel decentralized algorithm called EnforceAC to address the problem of multi-robot decision making with inconsistent beliefs. The key contributions are:

1) It introduces a formulation and addresses the open problem of multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP) with inconsistent beliefs across robots. Prior MR-BSP works assume consistent beliefs.

2) It develops the EnforceAC algorithm that leverages the concept of action consistency to identify if a consistent joint action can be guaranteed despite the inconsistent beliefs. If not, it self-triggers communication until action consistency is achieved.

3) It provides a theoretical guarantee that the EnforceAC algorithm will eventually identify a consistent joint action for the robot team.

4) It benchmarks the algorithm in simulations and compares it to two baseline approaches. The results show EnforceAC reduces communications by 30-40% compared to always communicating, while ensuring consistent actions.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel decentralized algorithm to enable consistent multi-robot decision making despite inconsistent beliefs by self-triggering communication only when necessary. This addresses an open problem in MR-BSP.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Multi-robot belief space planning (MR-BSP)
- Decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP)
- Inconsistent beliefs 
- Action consistency
- Self-triggered communication
- Multi-robot action consistency (MR-AC)
- Verify action consistency algorithm (VerifyAC) 
- Enforce action consistency algorithm (EnforceAC)

The paper focuses on multi-robot decision making and planning under uncertainty when the robots have inconsistent beliefs about the state of the environment. It leverages the concept of "action consistency" to develop decentralized algorithms that can coordinate the robots' actions despite inconsistent beliefs, while self-triggering communication only when necessary to resolve inconsistencies. The key algorithms developed are VerifyAC and EnforceAC. Overall, it addresses an open challenge in multi-robot systems by ensuring consistent and safe joint action selection under uncertain, decentralized conditions with limited communication.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims the proposed method is the first to address multi-robot belief space planning with inconsistent beliefs. What were some key limitations of prior approaches that prevented them from handling inconsistent beliefs between robots?

2. The concept of "action consistency" is core to the proposed approach. Can you explain in detail how action consistency allows coordination between robots even when beliefs are inconsistent? What specific reasoning does this enable?

3. The paper argues that achieving fully consistent beliefs between robots via communication can be prohibitively expensive. What alternatives to frequent, high-bandwidth communication does the proposed approach leverage to enable coordination despite inconsistent beliefs?

4. Explain the key steps of Algorithm VerifyAC and how they aim to identify joint actions that are likely to be consistent from multiple viewpoints (own belief, other's belief, belief about other's reasoning). What role does reasoning about missing information play here?

5. Algorithm EnforceAC triggers communication when joint action consistency cannot be verified. What specific conditions indicate the need to communicate, and what type of information would the triggered communication aim to share? 

6. How does the time complexity of EnforceAC scale with the number of time steps since the robots last had consistent beliefs? What drives this relationship? Could the algorithm be optimized further?

7. The empirical evaluation uses an information-gathering task. Why is inconsistent reasoning particularly problematic for such cooperative tasks? How might the performance benefits of the method differ across other multi-robot tasks?

8. The results show a tradeoff between communication efficiency and action quality. Is striking a better balance here possible? How might the method be extended to improve action quality despite inconsistent beliefs?

9. The approach assumes discrete action and observation spaces. What complications might arise in extending it to handle continuous spaces? How might the algorithms need to be adapted?

10. The paper claims the method applies broadly to decentralized multi-robot problems. What characteristics of a multi-robot domain determine whether leveraging action consistency would be suitable or not? When might alternative coordination approaches be more applicable?
