# [GaussianEditor: Editing 3D Gaussians Delicately with Text Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16037)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GaussianEditor, a framework for delicately editing 3D scenes represented as Gaussians using natural language instructions. It consists of three main components: (1) extracting the region of interest (RoI) from the instruction text using a language model assistant, (2) aligning the text RoI to the Gaussian scene representation using an image grounding model, and (3) editing the Gaussians within the RoI using a 2D diffusion model while preserving consistency. GaussianEditor demonstrates precise and multi-round editing capabilities, changing color, texture, and geometry of specific regions based on instructions. Experiments show it achieves more delicate edits compared to prior text-conditional 3D editing approaches like Instruct-NeRF2NeRF, while being over twice as fast to train. The explicit Gaussian scene representation is key to enabling precise region-based editing. Limitations relate to failures in sub-modules like grounding segmentation or 2D editing. Future work involves extending to dynamic scenes and improving evaluation metrics.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GaussianEditor, a framework to edit 3D scenes represented by Gaussians using text instructions, which can achieve precise and delicate editing by extracting the region of interest from instructions and aligning it to the 3D Gaussians.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as:

1. The paper proposes GaussianEditor, a systematic framework to achieve delicate 3D scene editing based on 3D Gaussian splatting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is one of the first methods to edit 3D scenes delicately via 3D Gaussians with text instructions.

2. The paper designs a series of techniques to achieve delicate editing, including extracting the region of interest (RoI) from text instructions, aligning the RoI to 3D Gaussians, and editing the scene within the Gaussian RoI. 

3. The proposed method achieves more delicate and precise editing results compared to the previous state-of-the-art method Instruct-NeRF2NeRF. Meanwhile, GaussianEditor enjoys a much faster training speed, within 20 minutes on a single V100 GPU, more than twice as fast as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF.

In summary, the core contribution is proposing a systematic framework named GaussianEditor to achieve delicate 3D scene editing by leveraging the explicit property of 3D Gaussians. A series of techniques are designed to localize the editing region and perform optimization within it. More delicate editing is achieved with higher efficiency compared to prior arts.

The paper proposes a framework called "GaussianEditor" for delicately editing 3D scenes represented as 3D Gaussians using text instructions. It focuses on precisely controlling the editing region using techniques like extracting the region of interest (RoI) from instructions, aligning it to the 3D Gaussians, and constraining the editing to happen only within the Gaussian RoI. Key capabilities include delicate and localized editing, faster training, and better quality than prior arts like InstructNeRF2NeRF. The technical concepts used include differentiable rendering of 3D Gaussians, grounding segmentation models to map text instructions to image regions, lifting image ROIs to 3D Gaussian ROIs, and using 2D diffusion models like InstructPix2Pix for editing.
