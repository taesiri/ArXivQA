# [WizardCoder: Empowering Code Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08568)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How can we enhance the performance of open-source Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) like StarCoder through more complex instruction fine-tuning using the Evol-Instruct method adapted for code?The key hypothesis appears to be that by adapting the Evol-Instruct method to generate more intricate code instruction data and fine-tuning StarCoder on this evolved dataset, they can substantially improve the code generation capabilities of StarCoder and achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other open-source Code LLMs. In essence, the paper is investigating whether applying Evol-Instruct specifically for code instructions can empower open-source Code LLMs to reach new performance levels on code generation tasks. Their proposed model WizardCoder aims to test this hypothesis through experiments on benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000.Does this capture the core research question and hypothesis? Let me know if you need any clarification on my interpretation of the central research focus.
