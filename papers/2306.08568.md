# [WizardCoder: Empowering Code Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08568)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, the central research question this paper seeks to address is:How can we enhance the performance of open-source Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) like StarCoder through more complex instruction fine-tuning using the Evol-Instruct method adapted for code?The key hypothesis appears to be that by adapting the Evol-Instruct method to generate more intricate code instruction data and fine-tuning StarCoder on this evolved dataset, they can substantially improve the code generation capabilities of StarCoder and achieve state-of-the-art results compared to other open-source Code LLMs. In essence, the paper is investigating whether applying Evol-Instruct specifically for code instructions can empower open-source Code LLMs to reach new performance levels on code generation tasks. Their proposed model WizardCoder aims to test this hypothesis through experiments on benchmarks like HumanEval, MBPP, and DS-1000.Does this capture the core research question and hypothesis? Let me know if you need any clarification on my interpretation of the central research focus.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces WizardCoder, a new Code LLM model that is empowered by applying Evol-Instruction fine-tuning specifically to the code domain. 2. WizardCoder outperforms all other open-source Code LLMs by a substantial margin on code generation benchmarks like HumanEval, HumanEval+, MBPP, and DS-1000.3. WizardCoder achieves better performance on HumanEval and HumanEval+ compared to the largest closed-source models like Anthropic's Claude and Google's Bard, despite being much smaller in size. 4. The authors propose adaptations to the Evol-Instruct method to make it more suitable for the code domain, including streamlining instructions, simplifying prompts, and adding code-specific instructions.5. The training process involves using Evol-Instruct to iteratively evolve an existing code instruction dataset (Code Alpaca), then fine-tuning the StarCoder model on this evolved dataset.In summary, the key contribution is developing a way to apply instruction fine-tuning effectively to Code LLMs through an adapted Evol-Instruct method, leading to state-of-the-art results by WizardCoder on major code generation benchmarks. The instructions and prompts are tailored specifically for the code domain rather than just using a general approach.
