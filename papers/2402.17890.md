# [From Inverse Optimization to Feasibility to ERM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17890)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on the problem of contextual inverse optimization (CIO), where the goal is to leverage contextual information (historical data) to predict the unknown parameters of an optimization problem given known optimal solutions. Specifically, the paper considers contextual inverse linear programming (CILP) where the optimization problem is a linear program (LP). The key challenge in CILP lies in the non-differentiable nature of LPs which precludes the use of standard auto-differentiation techniques for end-to-end training. 

Proposed Solution:
The main contributions of the paper are:

1. Reduction to Convex Feasibility: For a linear prediction model, CILP is reduced to a convex feasibility problem. This enables the use of algorithms like alternating projections (POCS) to solve CILP. The resulting revgrad algorithm has a linear convergence guarantee without needing additional assumptions like degeneracy or interpolation. 

2. Reduction to ERM: The feasibility problem is further reduced to empirical risk minimization (ERM) on a smooth, convex loss function satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. This allows the use of efficient first-order stochastic optimization methods. For a linear model, gradient descent on the proposed loss function is shown to be equivalent to the POCS approach.

3. Experiments: The method is evaluated on synthetic (shortest path, knapsack) and real-world (Warcraft, MNIST matching) datasets. Results demonstrate superior performance compared to baselines in terms of both estimate loss and decision loss metrics.

Key Highlights:
- Handles non-differentiability of LPs without requiring differentiation through optimization solvers
- Provides theoretical guarantee on linear convergence without needing problem-specific assumptions
- Allows leveraging stochastic first-order methods for scalability while retaining performance
- Empirically shows strong performance on real datasets compared to state-of-the-art

The paper makes notable contributions in developing a principled and scalable approach for the challenging CILP problem with convergence guarantees.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a method to solve the contextual inverse linear programming problem by reducing it to a convex feasibility problem and empirical risk minimization, enabling the use of efficient optimization algorithms while providing theoretical guarantees.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. For linear prediction models, it reduces the contextual inverse linear programming (CILP) problem to a convex feasibility problem. This allows the use of standard algorithms like alternating projections to efficiently solve CILP. Importantly, this reduction comes with theoretical convergence guarantees without needing additional assumptions.

2. It further reduces CILP to empirical risk minimization (ERM) on a smooth, convex loss function satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. This enables the use of scalable first-order optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent to handle large-scale problems, while retaining theoretical guarantees. 

3. It validates the proposed approach experimentally on synthetic and real-world tasks like shortest path and perfect matching. The results demonstrate improved performance over existing methods for CILP.

In summary, the main contributions are: (i) a novel reduction of CILP to convex feasibility, (ii) a further reduction to ERM for scalability, and (iii) experimental validation showing state-of-the-art performance. The key advantage is the ability to efficiently solve CILP with theoretical guarantees, without relying on restrictive assumptions.

7. Discuss the algorithmic stability results provided in Appendix C. What do these results imply about the generalization performance of SGD when used to minimize $h(\theta)$?

8. The synthetic experiments compare revgrad against several baseline methods. Analyze these results - which method performs best and why?

9. The real-world experiments demonstrate improved performance over baseline methods. Attribute this improved performance to one or more components of the proposed approach.

10. The method can handle non-linear but convex optimization problems. Provide an example instantiation for a quadratic program and discuss how the feasibility reduction can be applied.
