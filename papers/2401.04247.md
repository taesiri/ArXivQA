# [Robust Image Watermarking using Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04247)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Digital image watermarking is important for tracking image provenance and ownership.  
- With the rise of AI image generation models like stable diffusion, watermarking has become critical to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created images.
- However, stable diffusion can also remove watermarks injected by existing methods, circumventing current watermarking solutions.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new framework called \pjn that leverages stable diffusion itself for robust image watermarking.  
- Core idea: Identify a latent vector that contains a watermark pattern and can be mapped to the original image by stable diffusion. The latent vector space has redundancy - more than one latent vector can generate the same image.
- Key steps:
    1) Initialize the latent vector using diffusion inversion on the original image
    2) Inject a circularly symmetric watermark pattern into the Fourier space of the latent vector  
    3) Optimize the latent vector to reconstruct an image close to the original via stable diffusion 
    4) Mix the original and watermarked images to enhance image quality
- For detection, reconstruct latent vector from image via inversion, detect watermark pattern using statistical test
    
Main Contributions:
- Novel stable-diffusion-based image watermarking framework that embeds watermarks in latent space
- Empirically demonstrated to be highly robust against state-of-the-art attacks, including stable-diffusion-based attacks, with 98%+ detection rate
- Zero-shot capability circumvents training, allowing application to any existing images
- Maintains high image quality with imperceptible watermarks
- Significantly outperforms existing watermarking methods against combined attacks 

In summary, the paper introduces an innovative framework for robust invisible image watermarking that withstands even AI-based watermark removal attacks. By operating in the latent space of stable diffusion models, it achieves an effective balance between invisibility, quality preservation and attack resistance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new watermarking method called Zodiac that leverages stable diffusion models to robustly embed invisible watermarks into images, with empirical results showing it can withstand even the most advanced diffusion-based watermark removal attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel watermarking framework called ZoDiac that uses pre-trained stable diffusion models to robustly watermark images. Specifically:

1) ZoDiac injects watermarks into the latent space that stable diffusion models operate on, making the watermarks robust even against advanced stable-diffusion-based attacks. 

2) As a zero-shot approach built on top of pre-trained models, ZoDiac does not require dedicated model training for watermarking, making it readily applicable to watermark any existing images.

3) Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that ZoDiac achieves a high watermark detection rate (over 98%) and a low false positive rate (under 6.4%), outperforming state-of-the-art watermarking methods. It is also robust against various attacks including a composite attack combining multiple perturbation techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and empirically validating ZoDiac, a novel zero-shot watermarking technique using stable diffusion that makes watermarks imperceptible while being robust even against advanced AI-based removal attacks.

The paper proposes a novel framework called "ZoDiac" for robust image watermarking using pre-trained stable diffusion models. Key aspects include watermarking images by injecting information into the latent space, leveraging diffusion model inversion techniques, and empirically demonstrating robustness against advanced generative AI attacks. The zero-shot capability and not needing additional training are also notable features. Evaluation is performed on image quality preservation and attack resilience across various datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does Zodiac's approach of injecting watermarks into the latent space of images make the watermarks more robust, even against advanced stable diffusion attacks? What is the intuition behind this?

2. What modifications need to be made to the loss function in Equation 3 to balance the different components (L2 distance, SSIM loss, perceptual loss)? How were the weighting coefficients λs and λp calibrated? 

3. The adaptive image enhancement step mixes the original and watermarked images. What is the rationale behind only using the smallest γ that meets the SSIM threshold s*? How does this balance watermark robustness and image quality?

4. Explain the full statistical test procedure used in the watermark decoding phase to detect the presence of the watermark. What assumptions need to be made and why? 

5. Zodiac claims to be a zero-shot watermarking technique built on top of pre-trained diffusion models. What specifically makes it zero-shot and how does this contrast with other watermarking methods?

6. How does the latent vector initialization procedure using DDIM inversion help accelerate convergence during latent vector optimization? What makes it better than random initialization?

7. What modifications would need to be made to handle rotational attacks? How does Zodiac's "rotation auto-correction" defense work and what are the tradeoffs?

8. Why can't Zodiac encode meaningful watermark information like messages or IDs, unlike some other watermarking methods? What constraints lead to this limitation?

9. The ablation studies analyze the impact of two key hyperparameters - the SSIM and detection thresholds. How do they affect the tradeoff between image quality, watermark robustness, and false positive rates?

10. What differences, if any, are observed when applying Zodiac using different backbone diffusion models like stable-diffusion-2-1-base versus stable-diffusion-v1-4? How does this demonstrate flexibility?
