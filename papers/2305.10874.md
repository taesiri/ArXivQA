# [VideoFactory: Swap Attention in Spatiotemporal Diffusions for   Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10874)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve text-to-video generation by better modeling the relationship between spatial and temporal features? The key hypothesis appears to be:By strengthening the interaction between spatial and temporal perceptions through a novel swapped cross-attention mechanism, we can achieve mutual reinforcement of spatial and temporal features. This will lead to improved video quality, temporal coherence, and text-video alignment.In particular, the paper argues that prior approaches have overlooked the importance of jointly modeling space and time for text-to-video generation. Methods relying solely on separable spatial and temporal modules lead to temporal distortions and misalignments between text and video. To address this, the paper proposes a swapped spatiotemporal cross-attention mechanism that alternates the "query" role between spatial and temporal features. This facilitates bidirectional guidance so that spatial features can benefit from temporal context and vice versa.The central goal is to show that explicitly modeling the interplay between spatial and temporal representations is crucial for generating high-quality, coherent videos that align precisely with input text descriptions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a novel swapped spatiotemporal cross-attention mechanism to enable stronger interaction between spatial and temporal features for video generation. This facilitates mutual reinforcement between space and time.- It introduces a large-scale high-definition video generation dataset called HD-VG-130M. This dataset has 130 million open-domain text-video pairs with high-resolution, widescreen, and watermark-free videos. - It presents an overall VideoFactory framework for high-quality open-domain video generation using latent diffusion models. The framework incorporates the proposed swapped cross-attention and is trained on the new HD-VG-130M dataset.- Experiments show the method generates videos with better quality, temporal coherence, and text-video alignment compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, the key innovation is the swapped spatiotemporal attention design and the introduction of a large-scale high-quality video dataset. Together these advance the state-of-the-art in controllable video generation with textual descriptions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a novel video generation framework called VideoFactory that uses a swapped cross-attention mechanism between spatial and temporal features and trains on a new large-scale high-definition video dataset to achieve state-of-the-art text-to-video generation quality.
