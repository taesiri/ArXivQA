# [VideoFactory: Swap Attention in Spatiotemporal Diffusions for   Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10874)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we improve text-to-video generation by better modeling the relationship between spatial and temporal features? The key hypothesis appears to be:By strengthening the interaction between spatial and temporal perceptions through a novel swapped cross-attention mechanism, we can achieve mutual reinforcement of spatial and temporal features. This will lead to improved video quality, temporal coherence, and text-video alignment.In particular, the paper argues that prior approaches have overlooked the importance of jointly modeling space and time for text-to-video generation. Methods relying solely on separable spatial and temporal modules lead to temporal distortions and misalignments between text and video. To address this, the paper proposes a swapped spatiotemporal cross-attention mechanism that alternates the "query" role between spatial and temporal features. This facilitates bidirectional guidance so that spatial features can benefit from temporal context and vice versa.The central goal is to show that explicitly modeling the interplay between spatial and temporal representations is crucial for generating high-quality, coherent videos that align precisely with input text descriptions.
