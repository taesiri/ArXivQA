# [Large Language Models for Travel Behavior Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00819)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Travel behavior prediction (e.g. mode choice) is important for transportation planning and management. 
- Conventional methods rely on data to build mathematical models with calibrated parameters to represent human preferences. This can be complex and rely heavily on data availability.
- Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown reasoning and problem solving abilities without training data. Whether LLMs can be used for travel behavior prediction is an open question.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a framework to utilize LLM's reasoning ability to predict travel behavior using carefully designed prompts, without providing any training data. 
- Prompts include task description, travel characteristics, individual attributes and domain knowledge to guide the LLM's thinking process.  
- Ask LLM to output both the prediction and explanation to support interpretability.
- Conduct case study on travel mode choice prediction using Swissmetro survey data.

Main Contributions:
- First study exploring LLM's ability for travel behavior prediction through prompt engineering.
- Demonstrate competitive accuracy of LLM predictions compared to classical models like multinomial logit, random forest and neural networks.
- Propose a new paradigm to leverage LLM's reasoning for travel behavior forecasting without reliance on training data.
- Design contextual prompts that embed domain knowledge to improve prediction.
- Gain model interpretability by asking LLM to provide explanations.

In summary, this pioneering study opens up new possibilities of using advanced LLMs for travel demand analysis, by taking advantage of their reasoning capacity through careful prompt engineering.
