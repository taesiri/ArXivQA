# [Aardvark Weather: end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00411)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems are complex, computationally expensive to run, and require expert knowledge to maintain and improve. Recently, data-driven models have shown promising results in replacing components of the NWP pipeline, but they still rely on input from operational NWP systems for deployment. There is a need for an end-to-end weather prediction system that can operate independently without any external NWP input.  

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose Aardvark, the first end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting system. It consists of three modules - an encoder, a processor, and a decoder. The encoder ingests raw observations from multiple sources to estimate the initial atmospheric state. The processor uses this to generate forecasts, which are passed to the decoder to produce local forecasts. Convolutional neural networks are used as the backbone for their simplicity and scalability. The system handles both on-grid and off-grid observations using conditional neural processes.

Main Contributions:

- Aardvark is the first end-to-end system that replaces the entire NWP pipeline with a data-driven model, operating fully independently without any external NWP input.

- It ingests raw observations from multiple remote sensing and in-situ sources to estimate initial conditions and provides skillful global forecasts for 24 variables at 1-degree resolution for 5-7 days.

- It also provides local forecasts of temperature, wind speed and pressure at arbitrary land station locations, outperforming a simple interpolation baseline.

- Compared to existing learned systems and operational NWP, Aardvark uses orders of magnitude fewer computational resources while still producing skillful forecasts.

- Its simple CNN-based architecture is scalable and provides a strong proof-of-concept for using deep learning to replace complex operational systems.

In summary, Aardvark demonstrates the feasibility of replacing entire traditional NWP pipelines with end-to-end learned systems, paving the way for more performant and scalable weather prediction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Aardvark Weather is an end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting system that replaces the entire numerical weather prediction pipeline by mapping raw observations directly to global and local forecasts using a convolutional neural network architecture.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is an end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting system called Aardvark Weather. The key points are:

- Aardvark is the first system that tackles the entire numerical weather prediction (NWP) pipeline including initial state estimation, forecasting, and downstream tasks like generating local forecasts.

- It replaces the entire NWP pipeline with a machine learning model, taking raw observations as input and providing global and local forecasts as output. 

- The global forecasts are produced for 24 variables at multiple pressure levels at one-degree spatial resolution and 24 hour temporal resolution. These are skillful compared to hourly climatology at 5-7 day lead times.

- Local forecasts are produced for temperature, mean sea level pressure, and wind speed at diverse geographic weather station locations. These are skillful compared to an interpolated baseline from the IFS-HRES model.

- Aardvark achieves these results with much less compute resources than operational NWP systems or other machine learning weather models that only tackle parts of the pipeline.

So in summary, the main contribution is a complete end-to-end weather forecasting system using a machine learning model to replace the entire complex NWP pipeline while being simpler, more efficient, and still producing skillful forecasts.
