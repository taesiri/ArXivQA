# [Scalarizing Multi-Objective Robot Planning Problems using Weighted   Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07227)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies using a weighted maximum (WM) scalar objective function as an alternative to the commonly used weighted sum for multi-objective robot motion planning problems. The weighted maximum takes the maximum of the weighted objective values, rather than summing them. While weighted sum objectives are popular due to enabling efficient algorithms, they can fail to find optimal trade-offs when parts of the Pareto front are non-convex. In contrast, the weighted maximum is provably more expressive and Pareto-complete. The authors show how WM objectives can be incorporated into continuous motion planners as well as discrete graph search algorithms. For graph search, computing optimal paths for a WM objective is shown to be NP-hard. The paper presents a novel graph search algorithm that finds optimal WM cost paths by recording all paths to each vertex, similar to the Martin algorithm. Further heuristic improvements allow solving large problems in reasonable time. Through simulations on various planning problems, WM objectives are shown to find substantially richer sets of Pareto-optimal solutions compared to weighted sums. The proposed graph search algorithm can find close to optimal solutions within practical runtimes. Overall, weighted maximum objectives enable more expressive planning, while requiring only the same number of parameters as weighted sums.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using a weighted maximum objective function for multi-objective robot motion planning to enable finding a richer set of Pareto-optimal solutions compared to the commonly used but less expressive weighted sum method.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Proposing an alternative objective function for robot motion planning based on a weighted maximum (WM) of individual objectives instead of the commonly used weighted sum. The WM function allows for finding a richer set of trade-offs between objectives and is able to represent non-convex parts of Pareto fronts. Specifically, the contributions are:

1) Showing theoretically that the WM function is more expressive than the weighted sum, in the sense that it can represent all Pareto-optimal solutions.

2) Presenting a novel optimal graph search algorithm for finding paths that minimize the WM objective, along with proofs of correctness. The algorithm also has heuristic and budgeted variants for practical use.  

3) Demonstrating through simulations on various planning problems that the WM approach finds substantially more diverse Pareto-optimal solutions compared to the weighted sum. The proposed graph search is able to find optimal solutions within reasonable computation times.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the WM objective function as an improved alternative to weighted sums in robot motion planning, together with algorithms and experiments showcasing its advantages.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a weighted maximum (WM) cost function instead of a weighted sum (WS) cost function for multi-objective robot motion planning. What are the key theoretical advantages of the WM formulation over the WS formulation in terms of the achievable Pareto front?

2. The paper shows that optimizing the WM cost function is NP-hard for graph-based planning problems. Can you explain the reduction used in the proof and why a similar result does not hold for continuous optimization formulations? 

3. Algorithm 1 presents a complete search algorithm for finding optimal solutions for the WM cost function on graphs. What is the key idea behind eliminating suboptimal subpaths in this algorithm to maintain optimality guarantees? How does this differ from traditional shortest path algorithms?

4. What modifications are made to Algorithm 1 to incorporate heuristics and make it practically feasible on large graphs? How is the cost-to-go heuristic specifically designed in this context?

5. The experiments compare the WS and WM formulations on various planning problems. What metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate the quality of the achievable Pareto fronts? Can you suggest any other metrics that could be used?

6. In the continuous space motion planning experiment, what procedure is used to filter out potentially suboptimal solutions returned by the numerical solver? How could this process be improved to get better coverage of the Pareto front?

7. The runtime analysis of Algorithm 1 shows worst-case exponential complexity in the number of vertices. Do you think specialized data structures could be used to improve the average-case runtime? Elaborate.

8. The composition function Î² in the problem formulation allows combining edge costs in different ways. What are some examples of useful composition functions beyond summation that might be applicable in certain planning contexts?

9. The paper focuses on motion planning problems. What are some potential challenges in using the WM formulation instead of WS for learning reward functions from human feedback?

10. The weighted maximum formulation requires selecting suitable weight parameters to obtain different solutions on the Pareto front. What methods could you design to systematically explore good weight settings for different planning problems?
