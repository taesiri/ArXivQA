# [Scalarizing Multi-Objective Robot Planning Problems using Weighted   Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07227)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies using a weighted maximum (WM) scalar objective function as an alternative to the commonly used weighted sum for multi-objective robot motion planning problems. The weighted maximum takes the maximum of the weighted objective values, rather than summing them. While weighted sum objectives are popular due to enabling efficient algorithms, they can fail to find optimal trade-offs when parts of the Pareto front are non-convex. In contrast, the weighted maximum is provably more expressive and Pareto-complete. The authors show how WM objectives can be incorporated into continuous motion planners as well as discrete graph search algorithms. For graph search, computing optimal paths for a WM objective is shown to be NP-hard. The paper presents a novel graph search algorithm that finds optimal WM cost paths by recording all paths to each vertex, similar to the Martin algorithm. Further heuristic improvements allow solving large problems in reasonable time. Through simulations on various planning problems, WM objectives are shown to find substantially richer sets of Pareto-optimal solutions compared to weighted sums. The proposed graph search algorithm can find close to optimal solutions within practical runtimes. Overall, weighted maximum objectives enable more expressive planning, while requiring only the same number of parameters as weighted sums.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is:

Proposing an alternative objective function for robot motion planning based on a weighted maximum (WM) of individual objectives instead of the commonly used weighted sum. The WM function allows for finding a richer set of trade-offs between objectives and is able to represent non-convex parts of Pareto fronts. Specifically, the contributions are:

1) Showing theoretically that the WM function is more expressive than the weighted sum, in the sense that it can represent all Pareto-optimal solutions.

2) Presenting a novel optimal graph search algorithm for finding paths that minimize the WM objective, along with proofs of correctness. The algorithm also has heuristic and budgeted variants for practical use.  

3) Demonstrating through simulations on various planning problems that the WM approach finds substantially more diverse Pareto-optimal solutions compared to the weighted sum. The proposed graph search is able to find optimal solutions within reasonable computation times.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Scalarizing Multi-Objective Robot Planning Problems using Weighted Maximization":

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of balancing multiple potentially competing objectives in robot motion planning problems. A common approach is to formulate a weighted sum (WS) of the different objective functions into a single cost function. However, the WS approach has limitations in finding optimal trade-offs (Pareto-optimal solutions) between objectives, especially when parts of the Pareto front are non-convex. 

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose using an alternative weighted maximum (WM) scalarization method, where the maximum of the weighted objectives is used instead of the sum. This WM cost function is more expressive and able to find all Pareto-optimal solutions (i.e. Pareto-complete). Theoretical analysis shows limitations of weighted sum costs and advantages of WM costs. The challenges of using WM costs in continuous and discrete planning problems are discussed. For graph search, a novel algorithm is presented that finds optimal paths minimizing the WM cost. Further, a heuristic and budgeted version allow practical runtimes.

Main Contributions:
- Compare expressiveness of WS and WM costs theoretically and on planning problems
- Propose WM cost for robot motion planning, which is Pareto-complete  
- Show how to optimize WM costs in continuous and discrete spaces
- Develop novel graph search algorithm for optimizing WM costs 
- Demonstrate practical runtime heuristics for graph search
- Show substantially improved coverage of Pareto fronts with WM costs over WS costs in simulations

Overall, the paper clearly explains fundamental limitations of weighted sum costs for multi-objective planning. As an alternative, the weighted maximum is formally introduced and analyzed, with algorithmic solutions proposed. Extensive simulations highlight the practical advantages of using weighted maximum costs to explore wider ranges optimal trade-offs between objectives.
