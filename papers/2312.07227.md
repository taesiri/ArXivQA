# [Scalarizing Multi-Objective Robot Planning Problems using Weighted   Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07227)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper studies using a weighted maximum (WM) scalar objective function as an alternative to the commonly used weighted sum for multi-objective robot motion planning problems. The weighted maximum takes the maximum of the weighted objective values, rather than summing them. While weighted sum objectives are popular due to enabling efficient algorithms, they can fail to find optimal trade-offs when parts of the Pareto front are non-convex. In contrast, the weighted maximum is provably more expressive and Pareto-complete. The authors show how WM objectives can be incorporated into continuous motion planners as well as discrete graph search algorithms. For graph search, computing optimal paths for a WM objective is shown to be NP-hard. The paper presents a novel graph search algorithm that finds optimal WM cost paths by recording all paths to each vertex, similar to the Martin algorithm. Further heuristic improvements allow solving large problems in reasonable time. Through simulations on various planning problems, WM objectives are shown to find substantially richer sets of Pareto-optimal solutions compared to weighted sums. The proposed graph search algorithm can find close to optimal solutions within practical runtimes. Overall, weighted maximum objectives enable more expressive planning, while requiring only the same number of parameters as weighted sums.
