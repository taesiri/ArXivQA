# [UniVS: Unified and Universal Video Segmentation with Prompts as Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18115)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Developing a unified video segmentation (VS) model that can handle different VS tasks remains challenging. Category-specified VS tasks (e.g. video instance/semantic/panoptic segmentation) need to detect and track all objects across frames. Prompt-specified VS tasks (e.g. video/panoptic/referring object segmentation) require identifying targets described by visual/textual prompts throughout videos. The different focuses make it difficult to unify them in one model.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel unified architecture called UniVS that handles various VS tasks using prompts as queries. For each target, UniVS averages its prompt features from previous frames as the initial query to explicitly decode masks. A target-wise prompt cross-attention layer is introduced to integrate comprehensive prompt features from the memory pool. By taking predicted masks of entities from previous frames as visual prompts, UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided segmentation, eliminating heuristic inter-frame matching.

Main Contributions:
- UniVS unifies different category-specified and prompt-specified VS tasks into a single model, being the first to accomplish this.
- It uses prompts as queries for explicit mask decoding and prompt cross-attention to enhance uniqueness of target representations.
- It converts all VS tasks into prompt-guided segmentation during inference to avoid cumbersome post-matching.
- Experiments show UniVS achieves a good balance between performance and universality on 10 VS benchmarks, including video instance/semantic/panoptic segmentation and video/panoptic/referring object segmentation.

In summary, UniVS is the first unified architecture that can accommodate all existing VS tasks in one model with commendable versatility. It advances the capability of universal video understanding.
