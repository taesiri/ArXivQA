# [Conditional Wasserstein Distances with Applications in Bayesian OT Flow   Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18705)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Many conditional generative models for Bayesian inverse problems try to approximate the posterior by minimizing a distance between the joint distribution and the learned approximation.
- While controlling the joint distance bounds the expected posterior error for KL divergence, this is not true in general for Wasserstein distance. 
- The paper shows through a counterexample that the joint Wasserstein distance can be strictly smaller than the expected posterior Wasserstein distance.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a conditional Wasserstein distance by restricting the set of admissible couplings to those that don't transport mass in the conditioning (Y) direction.
- This conditional Wasserstein distance is shown to equal the expected posterior Wasserstein distance.

Contributions:
- Formal definition and analysis of properties of the conditional Wasserstein distance:
    - Shown to be a metric on conditional probability measures
    - Dual formulation relates to common losses in conditional Wasserstein GANs
    - Characterizes geodesics and velocity fields in the resulting metric space
- Proposes a relaxation of the conditional distance to enable practical applications
- Combines ideas with optimal transport based flow matching to develop Bayesian flow matching - demonstrates advantages over prior flow matching methods on example inverse problems

In summary, the paper provides the theoretical foundations to define a conditional Wasserstein distance tailored to Bayesian inverse problems, that relates joint and posterior distances. It leverages this theory to design improved generative modeling and sampling algorithms for such problems.
