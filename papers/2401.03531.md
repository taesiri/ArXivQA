## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) have emerged as extremely useful robots for navigation, sensing, and understanding environments in tight spaces. However, they face significant constraints in terms of power, payload, and computing capabilities. Existing microcontroller units (MCUs) used in nano-UAVs provide simple host processors without virtualization support and only hundreds of KB of on-chip memory. While recent MCUs integrate ASIC accelerators for higher performance, they suffer from poor flexibility and programmability. There is a need for a secure, flexible, and high-performance computing platform tailored for nano-UAV applications within tight power budgets.

Proposed Solution:
The paper presents Shaheen, a new 9mm^2 200mW System-on-Chip (SoC) for nano-UAVs implemented in 22nm technology. It features:

1) A Linux-capable 64-bit RV64 host core with hardware support for virtualization (first silicon with ratified RISC-V Hypervisor extension) and timing channel protection for secure multi-domain operations.

2) A low-power memory controller exposing up to 512MB off-chip HyperRAM to the host core, enough to host both general-purpose OS and real-time OS.  

3) A flexibleparallel accelerator cluster of eight 32-bit RV32 cores optimized for DSP and ML achieving up to 90GOp/s on 2-bit integer and 7.9GFLOp/s on 16-bit floating point operations.

The heterogeneous host-accelerator architecture enables both rich software stack support via virtualization on the host and high performance programmable acceleration, overcoming limitations of existing MCUs.

Main Contributions:

- First silicon prototype of a ULP SoC coupling RV64 and RV32 cores in a virtualization supported host-accelerator heterogeneous architecture.

- Hardware virtualization support on the host core with the first silicon implementation fully compliant with ratified RISC-V Hypervisor extension.

- A flexible RV32 accelerator cluster delivering best-in-class integer and floating point performance per Watt through parallelism and mixed-precision capabilities, significantly accelerating nano-UAV workloads. 

- Tight integration of host and accelerator via shared memory and I/O virtualization, enabling both real-time and rich OS support within 200mW power budget.

Overall, Shaheen provides a secure, flexible and high-performance nano-UAV computing platform advancing beyond state-of-the-art commercial MCUs. The open-source design fosters future research in AI-driven IoT edge devices.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents Shaheen, a heterogeneous 9mm^2 200mW SoC in 22nm technology featuring an RV64 core with security extensions coupled with a parallel programmable RV32 cluster, exposing up to 512MB RAM, enabling autonomous navigation for nano-UAVs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of Shaheen, a heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) prototype implemented in 22nm technology for autonomous nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) It integrates an RV64 host core (CVA6) with support for hardware virtualization (Hypervisor extension) and timing channel protection to enable secure co-existence of a Linux OS and real-time OS.

2) It features a low-power HyperRAM memory controller to expose up to 512MB of main memory to the host core, large enough to run full-fledged OSs.

3) It couples the RV64 host core with a parallel cluster of eight aggressively optimized RV32 cores called Flex-V cores, optimized for ML and DSP workloads. This heterogeneous RV64/RV32 architecture is the first such silicon prototype.

4) The Flex-V cores achieve state-of-the-art computational performance and energy efficiency for nano-UAV workloads like quantized neural networks, DSP algorithms, and online learning. 

5) The overall system fits within a 200mW power envelope and 9mm^2 die area, suitable for integration into nano-UAV platforms.

In summary, Shaheen prototypes an advanced, secure and high-performance heterogeneous architecture for autonomous nano-UAVs, enabled by innovations in the host core, memory subsystem, programmable accelerator, and their tight integration.
