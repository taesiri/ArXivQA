## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing multi-scale image deblurring methods are complex as they require fusing low-resolution RGB images with deep semantics. They also rely on manually generating low-resolution image pairs which is not reliable.  
- Multi-scale methods tend to lose detail information during progressive restoration.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a SIMO multi-scale network that takes a single blurred image as input and outputs restored images at different scales. This simplifies existing complex multi-scale architectures.
- Introduces a Learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform (LWDT) module to focus on directional continuity and frequency features of blur trajectories. This enhances detail recovery.
- Constructs reasonable multi-scale losses to guide pixel-level restoration across scales. Additional self-supervised losses constrain the learning of the wavelet transform.

Main Contributions:
- SIMO based multi-scale architecture that is efficient by avoiding fusion of multiple inputs and manual generation of scaled image pairs.
- Learnable wavelet transform that adapts to data distribution and restores high frequency details lost in multi-scale architectures. 
- Multi-scale loss for progressive restoration across scales and self-supervised loss to constrain wavelet transform learning.
- State-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world blur datasets with improved quality and efficiency.

In summary, the paper proposes a simplified and efficient multi-scale architecture for image deblurring that uses a learnable wavelet transform to recover fine details. This achieves top results on real-world blurry datasets in terms of both accuracy and speed.
