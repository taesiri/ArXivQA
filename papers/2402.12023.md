# [Evaluation of ChatGPT's Smart Contract Auditing Capabilities Based on   Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities if not properly audited, which can lead to severe financial losses. As auditing smart contracts manually is resource intensive, this paper explores using ChatGPT's capabilities to assist human auditors in detecting vulnerabilities and verifying exploitability. 

Proposed Solution
The authors conduct a set of experiments to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities in:
1) Detecting 7 types of vulnerabilities in 35 smart contracts from the SolidiFI benchmark dataset
2) Parsing code and detecting vulnerabilities in 8 sets of audited smart contracts 
3) Writing Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to verify 10 smart contract vulnerabilities

Key Findings
- For vulnerability detection on SolidiFI dataset, ChatGPT had high 96.6% precision but only 37.8% recall, indicating it missed many vulnerabilities. F1-scores varied greatly across vulnerability types.
- Compared to other tools, ChatGPT detected the fewest vulnerabilities on SolidiFI dataset, identifying limitations in its detection capability.  
- For audited smart contracts, ChatGPT showed reasonably good code parsing abilities but struggled to identify most vulnerabilities, achieving only 12.8% accuracy on average.
- When provided vulnerability hints, ChatGPT wrote usable PoCs 60% of the time. But it struggled to first detect then write PoCs, correctly identifying only 1 out of 10 vulnerabilities.

Main Contributions  
- First paper providing a systematic evaluation of ChatGPT's capabilities in smart contract auditing 
- Designed effective prompts and assessment metrics tailored to evaluate auditing capability
- Established that while ChatGPT shows promise as an assisting tool, it cannot fully replace professional auditors currently, especially for vulnerability detection

The paper provides meaningful insights into ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses in different smart contract auditing aspects, laying groundwork for further research on how to better utilize such models.
