# [Evaluation of ChatGPT's Smart Contract Auditing Capabilities Based on   Chain of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities if not properly audited, which can lead to severe financial losses. As auditing smart contracts manually is resource intensive, this paper explores using ChatGPT's capabilities to assist human auditors in detecting vulnerabilities and verifying exploitability. 

Proposed Solution
The authors conduct a set of experiments to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities in:
1) Detecting 7 types of vulnerabilities in 35 smart contracts from the SolidiFI benchmark dataset
2) Parsing code and detecting vulnerabilities in 8 sets of audited smart contracts 
3) Writing Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to verify 10 smart contract vulnerabilities

Key Findings
- For vulnerability detection on SolidiFI dataset, ChatGPT had high 96.6% precision but only 37.8% recall, indicating it missed many vulnerabilities. F1-scores varied greatly across vulnerability types.
- Compared to other tools, ChatGPT detected the fewest vulnerabilities on SolidiFI dataset, identifying limitations in its detection capability.  
- For audited smart contracts, ChatGPT showed reasonably good code parsing abilities but struggled to identify most vulnerabilities, achieving only 12.8% accuracy on average.
- When provided vulnerability hints, ChatGPT wrote usable PoCs 60% of the time. But it struggled to first detect then write PoCs, correctly identifying only 1 out of 10 vulnerabilities.

Main Contributions  
- First paper providing a systematic evaluation of ChatGPT's capabilities in smart contract auditing 
- Designed effective prompts and assessment metrics tailored to evaluate auditing capability
- Established that while ChatGPT shows promise as an assisting tool, it cannot fully replace professional auditors currently, especially for vulnerability detection

The paper provides meaningful insights into ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses in different smart contract auditing aspects, laying groundwork for further research on how to better utilize such models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper evaluates GPT-4's capabilities in smart contract auditing through experiments assessing its vulnerability detection, code parsing, and proof-of-concept writing, finding that while GPT-4 shows potential as an assisting tool, it still faces challenges in effectively detecting vulnerabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. To assess GPT-4's capability in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities, the authors chose the SolidiFI-benchmark vulnerability library as their dataset, selecting 35 smart contracts containing 732 injected vulnerabilities covering 7 common types of vulnerabilities. This is used to evaluate GPT-4's detection performance. 

2. To simulate real-world audit scenarios, the authors conducted experiments based on audit reports of 8 sets of smart contracts, which revealed a total of 60 vulnerabilities across 18 types, and designed a prompt based on Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to assess GPT-4's code parsing capabilities and ability to identify vulnerabilities.

3. To evaluate GPT-4's capability in identifying and verifying security vulnerabilities, the authors also selected 10 smart contracts and adopted a dual-modal experimental design to test GPT-4's ability to write Proof of Concepts (PoCs) in Solidity.

In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4's capabilities in smart contract vulnerability detection, code parsing, and PoC writing to assess its potential as an auxiliary tool to assist auditors and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of smart contract security audits.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper utilizes two datasets for evaluating GPT-4's capabilities - the SolidiFI benchmark dataset and 8 sets of audit reports. What are the key differences between these datasets and what unique insights does each provide into GPT-4's capabilities?

2. The prompt design incorporates several elements like role definition, chain of thought, requirement specifications, etc. Analyze the impact of each of these elements on GPT-4's performance. Which aspect played the most critical role?

3. The paper evaluates code parsing capability using 3 metrics - background understanding, function relationships, and comprehensive score. Discuss the effectiveness of this evaluation approach. What other metrics could potentially be included?  

4. For writing PoCs, two types of prompts were provided - one with vulnerability hints and one without. Compare GPT-4's performance in these two cases. What adjustments could be made to the prompts to further improve PoC quality?

5. The paper concludes GPT-4 has limitations in vulnerability detection. Critically analyze the root causes behind this deficiency based on factors like prompt design, knowledge base, reasoning ability etc.

6. Despite deficiencies in detection, GPT-4 demonstrates strengths in areas like code parsing. Explain the factors that enable it to perform better in such analytical tasks compared to vulnerability identification. 

7. The paper highlights instability and inconsistency in GPT-4's performance across metrics like code parsing, PoC writing etc. Suggest methods to improve consistency and stability.

8. Analyze the differences in precision, recall, F1 scores across the 7 vulnerability categories tested. What underlying reasons could explain this variance?

9. Compare GPT-4's performance to existing vulnerability detection tools listed in Table 3. What unique capabilities does GPT-4 demonstrate and what areas need improvement? 

10. The paper provides a preliminary evaluation of GPT-4 for smart contract auditing. Discuss additional experiments that can be conducted to further assess and improve its auditing capabilities.
