# [AutoHLS: Learning to Accelerate Design Space Exploration for HLS Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10686)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- High-level synthesis (HLS) allows rapid prototyping of hardware designs using languages like C/C++, but optimizing the designs by exploring different parameters like pragmas is time-consuming. 
- Existing multi-objective optimization tools like Bayesian Optimization (BO) are slow at finding optimal designs that meet hardware resource constraints.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes AutoHLS, a framework to accelerate design space exploration (DSE) for HLS using machine learning. 
- It focuses on exploring HLS pragmas and kernel code transformations to optimize objectives like latency, resource usage etc under constraints.
- Uses a DNN/QNN to predict if a design will synthesize successfully under resource constraints. This avoids wasting time trying to synthesize designs that will fail.
- Employs BO but with the DNN/QNN prediction to guide the search towards successful designs.

Key Contributions:
- Reveals that existing multi-objective optimization tools can fail to produce designs meeting resource budgets
- Proposes the AutoHLS framework to accelerate DSE using ML for synthesizability prediction
- Employs a novel Quantum Neural Network (QNN) based model for accurate resource usage prediction
- Experiments show AutoHLS can explore designs up to 70x faster than standard BO

In summary, the key idea is to use ML to predict if an HLS design will synthesize properly under resource constraints, and use this prediction to guide multi-objective optimization to find optimal designs much faster. The AutoHLS framework demonstrates significant speedups in design space exploration time.
