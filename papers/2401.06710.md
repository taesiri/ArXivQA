# [Model-Free Approximate Bayesian Learning for Large-Scale Conversion   Funnel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06710)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- The paper studies the problem of a firm trying to maximize the conversion probability of consumers to purchase a product by sending them personalized and sequential interventions (e.g. emails). 
- Consumer behavior is modeled via a Markov decision process (MDP) called the conversion funnel MDP. The states capture the interaction history of each consumer. The actions correspond to intervention types. Transitions capture how consumer state evolves based on interventions.  
- Key challenges are: (i) consumer behavior can be affected by many temporal, carryover and spillover effects making it complex; (ii) number of model parameters to estimate can be very large; (iii) need for policy to be scalable and interpretable.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a novel attribution-based decision-making algorithm called Model-Free Approximate Bayesian Learning (MFABL) that guides firm on optimal interventions.
- MFABL extends Thompson sampling from bandits to conversion funnel MDP in a model-free manner. It maintains a Beta belief over the value of each state-action pair. The belief gets updated via an attribution module.
- Two variants of attribution module: (i) attribute based on value of next state (ii) uniform attribution by rolling back outcome to state-action pairs on path.
- Despite approximate Bayes updates, prove asymptotic optimality of MFABL and analyze its convergence rate.

Main Contributions:
- Leverage terminal reward structure of conversion funnel MDP to design scalable and interpretable learning algorithm.
- Model-free method avoids estimating large number of model parameters. Attribution-based updates provide interpretability.
- Asymptotic optimality guarantee despite approximate Bayes updates. Faster initial learning via pathwise attribution.
- Demonstrate significant gains over benchmarks in large-scale simulations calibrated using real email marketing dataset.

In summary, the paper makes both theoretical and practical contributions in optimal personalized sequential targeting by developing a novel scalable learning algorithm guided by interpretable attribution rules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper develops a scalable, interpretable algorithm called model-free approximate Bayesian learning (MFABL) for optimizing large-scale conversion funnels in sequential marketing by exploiting their terminal reward structure; MFABL extends Thompson sampling to this context through attribution-based updating of state-action beliefs and is proven asymptotically optimal despite being an approximation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called Model-Free Approximate Bayesian Learning (MFABL) for solving the conversion funnel optimization problem. Specifically:

- The paper formulates the conversion funnel optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with a large state space and unknown transition dynamics. The goal is to maximize the conversion probability by taking optimal sequential personalized interventions.

- To solve this large-scale sequential learning problem, the paper develops the MFABL algorithm that maintains interpretable Beta-distributed beliefs over the value of each state-action pair. It uses an attribution-based update rule to update these beliefs in a model-free manner.

- Despite using an approximate Bayes update, the paper proves that MFABL converges asymptotically to the optimal policy. It also analyzes the convergence rate and discusses properties like scalability, interpretability, ability to incorporate prior information, and robustness to concept drift.

- Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MFABL in learning near-optimal solutions using real-world email marketing data, outperforming existing Bayesian RL methods.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing, analyzing and evaluating the MFABL algorithm that provides an interpretable, scalable and optimal solution to the conversion funnel optimization problem formulated as a large-scale MDP.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the model-free approximate Bayesian learning (MFABL) method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims MFABL is asymptotically optimal, but can you rigorously define what optimality means in this context and discuss the assumptions required for the optimality result to hold? 

2. Theorem 1 claims MFABL converges to the optimal Q-values $\mathbf{Q}^*$ but does not characterize the rate of convergence. Can you provide insight into how quickly MFABL converges as a function of number of consumers $N$?

3. How does the performance of MFABL compare empirically to other reinforcement learning algorithms like Q-learning or deep Q-networks when applied to the conversion funnel MDP?

4. One of the key ideas in MFABL is to use an approximate Bayesian update rule to maintain beliefs over Q-values. Can you discuss the challenges in deriving the exact Bayesian posterior in this sequential decision making context?  

5. The attribution module of MFABL uses generated feedback $f_{s'}$ to update beliefs. What are some alternatives for defining this attribution rule and how might they impact empirical performance?

6. What are some ways the convergence proofs for MFABL could be extended, for example to analyze the pathwise MFABL variant or to allow for more gradual concept shift dynamics?

7. How does the performance of MFABL degrade in the presence of partial observability in the conversion funnel MDP? Can the algorithm be adapted to handle latent state dynamics?

8. Could monotonic improvement guarantees be derived for MFABL, i.e., that the policy improves monotonically with more data? Why or why not?

9. The paper focuses on episodic problems with a finite time horizon $T$. How could MFABL be extended to continuous-time or infinite-horizon process control problems?

10. What practical implementation challenges might arise when deploying MFABL at scale in a production optimization system? How could the algorithm design be adapted to address computational or data infrastructure constraints?
