# [Overcome the Fear Of Missing Out: Active Sensing UAV Scanning for   Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper deals with the problem of efficient path planning for a UAV deployed for precision agriculture applications. Typically, UAVs scan agricultural fields uniformly using back-and-forth motions at a constant speed. However, this can be inefficient as it spends equal time in information-sparse and information-rich areas. The key questions are: (1) Can the information received online by the UAV be used to "steer" it towards a more efficient non-uniform scanning policy? (2) How to do this in a computationally efficient manner that scales to large fields?

Proposed Solution - OverFOMO:
The paper proposes an active sensing algorithm named "OverFOMO" that regulates the UAV's speed based on the vegetation coverage and the confidence of the coverage estimation from the latest captured image. This avoids spending too much time in information-sparse areas, while gathering more reliable information from information-rich areas by slowing down. 

The core ideas are:
(1) Use an optimal back-and-forth trajectory from the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm as the base path. This ensures completeness and efficiency. 
(2) Add an online speed adjustment scheme that uses two metrics on each captured image: (i) Coverage Ratio (fraction of vegetation pixels), estimating information quantity; (ii) Confidence Level of the coverage prediction, estimating information quality.
(3) designed a mapping function to translate these metrics into UAV speed updates using piecewise linear and quadratic weighting functions.

The method has low computational overhead as the speed updates only use the latest image, not the entire map.

Main Contributions:
(1) Novel active sensing algorithm for UAV coverage planning inheriting optimality of STC trajectories
(2) Online UAV speed adjustment scheme using coverage ratio and prediction confidence metrics 
(3) Simulation pipeline combining real image data and high-fidelity UAV dynamics 
(4) Improved agriculture scanning efficiency demonstrated over baseline lawnmower approach

The algorithm is available in open-source at: url


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an adaptive coverage path planning approach named OverFOMO that regulates the speed of a UAV scanning an agricultural field based on the detected vegetation coverage and the confidence level of those detections, aiming to maximize coverage quality while minimizing flight time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Development of a novel active sensing coverage path planning approach, named OverFOMO, that regulates the speed of the UAV based on the online received information about vegetation coverage and the confidence level of the detections. This allows to spend less time in areas with little valuable information while ensuring high precision in information-rich regions.

2) A robust Deep Learning-based module that adjusts the UAV speed by considering both the quantity of detected relevant instances (crops and weeds) and the certainty/quality of these detections.

3) An open-source, modular, simurealistic pipeline combining the AirSim simulator with real RGB images to validate the proposed approach.

4) Validation of OverFOMO against standard lawn-mower coverage methods like Spanning-Tree Coverage (STC), showing improved performance in terms of flight time, image quality, and segmentation accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel active sensing path planning approach OverFOMO that can regulate the UAV speed during flight based on the perceived information to achieve efficient and high-quality scanning of agricultural fields.

3. The paper proposes using the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm as a core element of the coverage path. Why is STC chosen over other coverage path planning algorithms? What properties does it have that make it suitable for this application?

4. Explain the two key metrics - coverage ratio (cr) and confidence level (cl) - used to assess the information gain from the captured images. How do they aim to quantify both the amount and quality of information in an image? 

5. Walk through the details of how the speed adjustment is performed based on the cr and cl metrics. Explain the roles of the translation functions gi(.) and weighting functions Ï‰i(.) in the formulation.
