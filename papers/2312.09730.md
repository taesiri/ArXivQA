# [Overcome the Fear Of Missing Out: Active Sensing UAV Scanning for   Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper deals with the problem of efficient path planning for a UAV deployed for precision agriculture applications. Typically, UAVs scan agricultural fields uniformly using back-and-forth motions at a constant speed. However, this can be inefficient as it spends equal time in information-sparse and information-rich areas. The key questions are: (1) Can the information received online by the UAV be used to "steer" it towards a more efficient non-uniform scanning policy? (2) How to do this in a computationally efficient manner that scales to large fields?

Proposed Solution - OverFOMO:
The paper proposes an active sensing algorithm named "OverFOMO" that regulates the UAV's speed based on the vegetation coverage and the confidence of the coverage estimation from the latest captured image. This avoids spending too much time in information-sparse areas, while gathering more reliable information from information-rich areas by slowing down. 

The core ideas are:
(1) Use an optimal back-and-forth trajectory from the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm as the base path. This ensures completeness and efficiency. 
(2) Add an online speed adjustment scheme that uses two metrics on each captured image: (i) Coverage Ratio (fraction of vegetation pixels), estimating information quantity; (ii) Confidence Level of the coverage prediction, estimating information quality.
(3) designed a mapping function to translate these metrics into UAV speed updates using piecewise linear and quadratic weighting functions.

The method has low computational overhead as the speed updates only use the latest image, not the entire map.

Main Contributions:
(1) Novel active sensing algorithm for UAV coverage planning inheriting optimality of STC trajectories
(2) Online UAV speed adjustment scheme using coverage ratio and prediction confidence metrics 
(3) Simulation pipeline combining real image data and high-fidelity UAV dynamics 
(4) Improved agriculture scanning efficiency demonstrated over baseline lawnmower approach
