# [NeRFLiX: High-Quality Neural View Synthesis by Learning a   Degradation-Driven Inter-viewpoint MiXer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06919)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the quality of novel view synthesis from neural radiance fields (NeRFs)? The paper proposes that even state-of-the-art NeRF models produce rendered views that suffer from artifacts such as noise and blur. They hypothesize that these "NeRF-style" artifacts could be reduced by:1) Learning to simulate and remove common NeRF rendering artifacts using a large-scale paired training dataset.2) Developing an "inter-viewpoint mixer" that can aggregate information from multiple high-quality input views to restore details and reduce artifacts in the rendered views.Specifically, the paper introduces:- A "NeRF degradation simulator" to generate synthetic paired data for training artifact removal models.- An "inter-viewpoint mixer" architecture that aligns and fuses information from multiple input views to enhance a rendered view. - A view selection method to choose the most relevant input views for aggregation.The central hypothesis is that by addressing these challenges, they can improve the visual quality (reduce noise, add details) of novel views rendered by existing NeRF models. The experiments aim to validate whether their proposed NeRFLiX approach can consistently enhance the results of different state-of-the-art NeRF methods.
