# [Artifact: Measuring and Mitigating Gaps in Structural Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0316)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we measure and mitigate gaps in structural testing to improve test suite effectiveness? More specifically, the paper proposes and investigates two main ideas:1. Measuring coverage gaps using host checked coverage (HCC) - an extension of checked coverage that identifies under-tested program structures that require more testing. The gap is calculated as the difference between regular code coverage and HCC.2. Mitigating gaps by using a recommender system to suggest additional test assertions to enrich the test suite. This is hypothesized to help close the coverage gaps and improve the fault detection ability of test suites.The overall goal is to quantify and address the limitations of structural coverage criteria like statement coverage in assessing test suite effectiveness. The main hypothesis seems to be that measuring and reducing the HCC gap will yield improved fault detection. The experiments aim to evaluate this hypothesis and the utility of the proposed HCC-based gap measurement and recommender-based gap mitigation techniques.In summary, the central research question revolves around demonstrating the existence of coverage gaps, showing their correlation with fault detection, and investigating methods to mitigate those gaps.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a method called "host checked coverage" (HCC) to measure gaps in structural testing coverage. This extends the concept of checked coverage to identify under-tested program structures that require more testing. 2. Showing through a large-scale study that there is a strong negative correlation between the HCC gap and the fault-detection effectiveness of a test suite.3. Implementing a lightweight static recommender system that suggests additional assertions to enrich test suites, with the goal of closing HCC gaps and improving fault detection. 4. Providing an artifact with data, tools, scripts, and documentation to reproduce the experiments and results in the paper. This includes a VirtualBox VM image for easily setting up the execution environment.In summary, the main contribution appears to be introducing and evaluating the HCC metric and gap-reduction recommender system to help improve the effectiveness of structural testing. The artifact allows reproducing the approach and results.
