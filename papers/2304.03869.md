# [Harnessing the Spatial-Temporal Attention of Diffusion Models for   High-Fidelity Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03869)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we improve the fidelity and consistency of images generated by text-to-image diffusion models with respect to complex text descriptions that contain multiple objects and spatial relationships?The key hypotheses tested in this paper are:1) Explicitly controlling the spatial and temporal cross-attention in diffusion models can improve fidelity by guiding when and where the model attends to different parts of the text description during image generation.2) Using a separate layout predictor to determine object locations and imposing spatial attention control according to the layout can improve object and spatial fidelity. 3) Allowing the combination weights between global and local text attention to change over denoising steps and optimizing them based on CLIP similarity can improve attribute and object fidelity by shifting focus from global to local descriptions.In summary, the central goal is improving fidelity of diffusion-based text-to-image generation through better control over the spatial and temporal cross-attention between text and image. The key hypotheses are around using layout prediction and optimized attention combination to achieve this.
