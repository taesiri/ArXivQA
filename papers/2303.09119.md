# [Taming Diffusion Models for Audio-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09119)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to generate high-fidelity co-speech gestures with strong audio correlations and temporal consistency using diffusion models. 

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a novel diffusion-based framework called DiffGesture for audio-driven co-speech gesture generation. 

- Existing methods using GANs for this task suffer from mode collapse and unstable training, making it difficult to learn accurate audio-gesture joint distributions. 

- Diffusion models provide a new perspective for realistic generation, but adapting them for generating temporally coherent gestures conditioned on audio is non-trivial.

- The paper aims to effectively capture cross-modal audio-to-gesture associations while preserving temporal coherence using the proposed diffusion framework.

- The main components of DiffGesture are:
  - Establishing diffusion and denoising processes in gesture space
  - Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer to attend to multiple modalities
  - Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer to reduce temporal inconsistency
  - Implicit classifier-free guidance for quality-diversity tradeoff

- Experiments show DiffGesture outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generates coherent gestures with stronger audio correlations.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that the proposed diffusion framework can overcome limitations of GANs and generate high-fidelity co-speech gestures that align well with the audio conditioning while maintaining temporal coherence.
