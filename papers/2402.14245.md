# [Enhancing Robotic Manipulation with AI Feedback from Multimodal Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14245)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance decision-making presents challenges in aligning the natural language suggestions from LLMs with the vectorized operations required for execution. This often necessitates task-specific details, limiting adaptability to novel tasks. 

Proposed Solution: Inspired by preference-based policy learning, the authors investigate using multimodal LLMs to provide automated preference feedback solely from image inputs to guide decision-making, without needing task-specific details. They introduce CriticGPT, an LLM fine-tuned on robot manipulation videos to serve as a "critic" by analyzing trajectories and providing preference judgments. 

A large dataset of robot manipulation trajectory videos is collected with automated natural language analyses and preference labels based on task completion. The LLM LLaVA is fine-tuned on this dataset to obtain CriticGPT. Experiments show CriticGPT achieves 95%+ accuracy in preferring successful over failed trajectories.

CriticGPT's preferences are used to learn a reward model. Policies are then trained under this reward model using the RL algorithm DrQ-v2. Evaluations on Meta-World environments show policies guided by CriticGPT's reward model match or exceed the performance of sparse rewards and rewards based on state-of-the-art representation models like LIV. Critically, CriticGPT generalizes to unseen tasks. 

Main Contributions:
1) Proposal of CriticGPT as a powerful tool for analyzing robot manipulation videos and providing effective preference feedback for the first RLAIF approach in this domain.
2) Demonstration that CriticGPT feedback generalizes to new tasks, achieving efficient policy learning.
3) Construction of a large-scale multimodal dataset with trajectory videos and preference analyses for model evaluation.

The capabilities of CriticGPT are expected to expand as the dataset grows, empowering more visual robot tasks.
