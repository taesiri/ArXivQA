## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper describes the technical development process of designing and building a semi-autonomous robotic partition prototype. The motivation is to create a robotic partition that can navigate autonomously between different locations in an office environment. This prototype was later used in a real-world study to evaluate human-building interaction.

The robotic partition consists of a 180x210cm aluminum frame fitted with two acoustic panels, various sensors and components, and a customized mobile robot base using KELO modules. The hardware design focuses on solutions for: 
- Ensuring stability during movement using caster wheels
- Preventing robotic configuration issues like hyperstaticity 
- Aligning drive wheel orientations properly

Additional hardware like LIDAR scanners, displays, buttons, etc. are incorporated to enable autonomous navigation capabilities. 

The autonomous navigation software is built on ROS. It integrates existing ROS libraries and 6 new custom modules developed by the authors. The key capabilities enabled are:
- Manual control using a gamepad
- Merging and filtering LIDAR scanner data  
- Mapping the environment using Cartographer
- Localizing itself within the map using AMCL
- Navigating between locations using TEB planner
- Detecting dynamic obstacles
- Interfacing with a web-based user control interface

Various parameters of the software modules are optimized through empirical testing to improve navigation smoothness, trajectory planning, and obstacle avoidance.

The paper concludes by listing potential areas of future technical development, including achieving more complete autonomous decision making abilities. Overall, it documents the iterative design process and solutions involved in developing an autonomous robotic partition prototype.
