# [Contributing Dimension Structure of Deep Feature for Coreset Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16193)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing coreset selection methods rely on similarity metrics (e.g. L2 distance) to measure representation and diversity of data. However, these metrics simply aggregate dimension similarities without considering differences in contributing dimensions to the overall similarity. This leads to ineffective assessment of diversity, as distinct samples may be treated as equally important. 

Solution:
The paper proposes a Contributing Dimension Structure (CDS) metric and constraint to improve diversity measurement. The key ideas are:

1) CDS metric: Computes a binary vector indicating whether each dimension of a feature contributes significantly to its similarity with a reference feature. This represents the CDS of a sample.  

2) CDS constraint: Constraints selected subset to have maximum diversity in CDS types. Two implementations: 
   - Hard constraint: 2-stage clustering + selection within each cluster.  
   - Soft constraint: Integrate CDS diversity term into objective function.

By compelling selected subsets to have diverse CDS structures, the methods avoid treating distinct samples as similar, better capturing diversity.

Contributions:

- Novel CDS metric to evaluate impact of different dimensions on similarity, going beyond aggregated metrics like L2 distance

- CDS diversity constraint, with hard and soft implementations, to select diverse CDS structures

- Experiments showing CDS constraint consistently improves 5 classical selection methods on 3 datasets, under class-balanced and imbalanced sampling

- Ablation studies validating necessity of CDS metric components  

The proposed CDS metric and constraint present an effective way to improve diversity measurement in coreset selection methods, with demonstrated generalization ability.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new Contributing Dimension Structure (CDS) metric and diversity constraint to select a more informative and diverse subset from a large dataset for efficient deep learning.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes three main contributions:

1. It introduces the concept of Contributing Dimension Structure (CDS) of deep features and proposes a novel CDS metric to quantify the CDS of individual samples. This allows capturing more diverse, informative samples for coreset selection. 

2. It proposes a feature-based CDS diversity constraint (CDS constraint) to improve existing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods by compelling the selected subset to have as many different CDS as possible. Two implementations of the CDS constraint are presented - Hard CDS Constraint and Soft CDS Constraint.

3. Extensive experiments on three image classification datasets demonstrate that integrating the proposed CDS metric and CDS constraint can effectively improve five classical coreset selection methods under two data sampling modes. This shows the general effectiveness of the proposed approach in boosting existing methods by adequately capturing diversity.

In summary, the main contribution lies in using the proposed CDS metric and CDS constraint to enrich diversity within coreset selection and improve model performance. The effectiveness of this approach is shown across a spectrum of methods and datasets.

The paper introduces the concept of "contributing dimension structure" (CDS) to capture the dimensions of feature vectors that contribute significantly to measuring similarity between data points. It proposes a CDS metric and CDS diversity constraint to select a diverse coreset that improves model performance. The key ideas include using Hard and Soft CDS constraints to enhance existing coreset selection methods like distribution matching, gradient matching, and submodularity-based methods. The constraints aim to increase CDS diversity in the selected subset. The effectiveness is shown through experiments on image classification datasets.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key motivation behind proposing the Contributing Dimension Structure (CDS) metric? How does it help to better capture diversity compared to traditional similarity metrics like L2 distance?

2. Explain the two main steps involved in computing the CDS metric for a sample - (1) Dimension reduction using PCA and (2) Obtaining the binary CDS vector by comparing feature differences against a threshold. 

3. How is the CDS relationship matrix computed for each class? What information does this symmetric matrix encode about samples from the same class?

4. What is the difference between samples having the same CDS versus samples having different CDS structures according to the proposed CDS metric? Provide an illustrative example. 

5. What are the two main implementations of the CDS constraint presented in the paper - Hard CDS Constraint and Soft CDS Constraint? Explain the key idea behind each with examples.

6. For the Hard CDS Constraint, explain the two-stage clustering process in detail. How does it explicitly try to increase CDS diversity within selected subsets?

7. Describe the overall greedy algorithm for coreset selection with Soft CDS Constraint. How is the CDS diversity constraint imposed within existing objective functions like in CRAIG and Graph Cut methods?

8. Analyze the ablation study results by incrementally adding various components of the overall proposed pipeline. What do the results indicate about the contribution of techniques like dimension reduction, partition, CDS relationship etc.?

9. How do the empirical analysis experiments motivate the need to select more samples with different CDS structures? What trends are observed w.r.t model performance?

10. Besides accuracy improvements, what other potential benefits does increasing the diversity of CDS structures within coresets provide? Does it help enhance model generalization ability?
