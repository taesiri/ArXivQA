# [Signature Kernel Conditional Independence Tests in Causal Discovery for   Stochastic Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18477)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Inferring causal relationships from observational time series data is challenging, but can provide insights into disease progression, stock prices, scientific discoveries etc.
- Most work assumes discrete-time models with fixed lagged dependencies, which have limitations. 
- Continuous-time models based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are more flexible but under-explored for causal discovery.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop constraint-based algorithms for causal discovery that leverage conditional independence relations to learn causal graphs from irregularly-sampled multivariate time series generated from SDE models. 
- Propose a flexible conditional independence (CI) test that handles path-valued random variables based on signature kernels.
- Present an algorithm to discover the full causal DAG by using future-extended conditional independence relations that incorporate the direction of time.
- Also develop an algorithm to discover the CPDAG representing the Markov equivalence class based on symmetric conditional independence.

Contributions:
- Introduce a flexible SDE-based model that captures path-dependent stochastic processes and irregular observations.
- Develop sound and complete constraint-based algorithms for causal discovery from such processes.
- Propose a signature kernel based CI test tailored for path-valued processes that outperforms baselines.
- Empirically demonstrate superior performance in recovering synthetic causal graphs with up to 5 nodes across various settings.
- Show improved performance on a real-world pairs trading application compared to baselines.

In summary, the paper introduces new methodology for causal discovery from irregularly-sampled multivariate time series and demonstrates its effectiveness empirically. The flexible SDE model, constraint-based algorithms leveraging conditional independence, and signature kernel based tests are the main technical innovations.
