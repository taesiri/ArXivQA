## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The recently introduced Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows remarkable zero-shot capability and flexibility for general image segmentation using geometric prompts like points and boxes. However, SAM often struggles when dealing with unconventional images like aerial, medical, X-ray, SAR, and sonar images that are sparse or out-of-distribution from its training data. Directly fine-tuning SAM requires extensive labeled data and loses its zero-shot capabilities. Therefore, how to effectively adapt SAM to these unconventional domains with limited labeled data is an important open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes CAT-SAM, a conditional tuning network to adapt SAM to unconventional domains using just a few target samples (few-shot adaptation). CAT-SAM jointly tunes SAM's heavyweight image encoder and lightweight mask decoder simultaneously while keeping the whole SAM model frozen. To address the tuning imbalance between these two components, a novel prompt bridge structure is introduced to map prompts from the decoder to the encoder, enabling synergetic and balanced adaptation. CAT-SAM is developed in two variants by integrating the prompt bridge with prompt tuning (CAT-SAM-T) or adapter tuning (CAT-SAM-A).

Main Contributions:
- Proposes CAT-SAM for few-shot adaptation of SAM to unconventional domains by conditional joint tuning of image encoder and mask decoder.
- Introduces prompt bridge to enable balanced tuning and mitigate imbalance between heavyweight encoder and lightweight decoder.  
- Develops two CAT-SAM variants by combining prompt bridge with prompt tuning (CAT-SAM-T) and adapter tuning (CAT-SAM-A).
- Shows superior adaptation performance across 11 datasets with just 1-shot samples, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
