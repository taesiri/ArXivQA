# [CustomListener: Text-guided Responsive Interaction for User-friendly   Listening Head Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00274)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
Existing listening head generation methods can generate diverse and fine-grained listener motions based on simple emotional labels (e.g. positive, neutral, negative). However, they lack explicit control over the motions and can't generate realistic listener agents that have customizable attributes like identity, personality, habits. Simple labels are not enough for accurate control.

Proposed Solution - CustomListener Framework
The paper proposes the CustomListener framework that enables free-form text-guided listening head generation, allowing explicit control over motions. Key components:

1. Static to Dynamic Portrait (SDP) Module: Transforms static portrait tokens from text prior into dynamic tokens that incorporate time-dependent info about motion rhythm and completion. Allows motions to fluctuate with speaker's semantics and movements to achieve speaker-listener coordination.

2. Past-Guided Generation (PGG) Module: Generates motion prior based on similarity between current and past portrait tokens. Uses diffusion model with fixed noise at segment transitions. Ensures motion coherence between segments and maintains listener's customizable attributes/habits reflected in past segments.

Main Contributions:

- Enables freely controllable listening head generation guided by text priors instead of simple labels
- SDP module to transform static portrait into dynamic one for speaker-listener coordination 
- PGG module to achieve coherent motions and maintain listener's customized attributes/habits
- Constructed text-annotated listening head datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance in controllability, interactivity and realism

The key novelty is the ability to guide motions via free-form text and explicitly control listener behaviors, while ensuring coordination with speaker and coherence between segments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework called CustomListener to enable free-form text-guided generation of realistic and controllable listening head motions that interact with the speaker.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing the CustomListener framework that enables freely controllable listener head generation guided by text priors, overcoming the limitations of simple emotion labels used in previous works.

2. Designing the Static to Dynamic Portrait (SDP) module to achieve speaker-listener coordination. The SDP module transforms static portrait tokens into dynamic ones that incorporate information about the timing and rhythm of motions as well as fluctuations related to the speaker's semantics, tone, and movements. 

3. Designing the Past-guided Motion Generation (PGG) module to ensure motion coherence between different text-conditioned segments in long videos. The PGG maintains consistency of the customized listener's habits and enables smooth transitions.

4. Constructing two new text-annotated datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk to provide text-video pairs for training and evaluating text-conditional listener generation models.

5. Demonstrating through extensive experiments that the proposed CustomListener framework can generate controllable, coherent and interactive listener motions superior to previous state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the CustomListener framework to achieve customizable, controllable and interactive listener head generation guided by free-form text priors. The SDP and PGG modules are also important technical contributions enabling speaker-listener coordination and motion coherence respectively.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a user-friendly framework called CustomListener for text-guided responsive listener head generation. Could you elaborate more on why simple emotion labels are not sufficient for achieving freely controllable listener generation? What are the key limitations?

2. The SDP module is designed to transform static portrait tokens into dynamic ones through audio-text responsive interaction and speaker motion-based refinement. Could you explain in more detail the motivation and technical details of these two stages? How do they enable better speaker-listener coordination?  

3. The paper argues that ensuring listener motion coherence between different text-guided segments is more complex than simple motion switching. Could you discuss this argument more thoroughly? Why does it require maintaining consistency of customized behavioral habits from past segments?

4. The Past-Guided module generates a motion prior based on similarity of portrait tokens between adjacent segments. What is the intuition behind using portrait token similarity to determine weights assigned to past motions? Does this approach have any limitations?  

5. The diffusion-based structure is used for final motion generation conditioned on portrait tokens and motion prior. What are the benefits of using a diffusion model here compared to other conditional generation frameworks?

6. The paper constructs annotated datasets based on ViCo and RealTalk to enable text-guided listener generation research. What are some limitations of the current datasets? What additional annotations could be useful for future work?  

7. The quantitative results demonstrate strong performance over baselines. Could you analyze the results more deeply to highlight which metrics show the most significant gains and why? Are there any metrics where performance could still be improved?

8. Could you qualitatively compare and critique some sample visual results between the proposed method and prior arts? Are there situations/motions that still prove challenging?

9. The paper focuses on guiding listener motions using text. Do you think extending this framework to also leverage other modalities like audio could be beneficial? What research problems would that entail? 

10. The current method generates only listener heads. How feasible would it be to extend this approach to full body generation for embodied conversational agents? What new challenges need to be addressed?
