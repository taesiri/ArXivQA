# [Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06695)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates how neural structures evolved at an evolutionary timescale can enhance an agent's ability to adapt and learn complex behaviors at a developmental timescale, akin to how animals develop abilities over their lifetimes. Specifically, it aims to model the interplay between evolution and lifelong learning.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a computational framework called Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning (ER-MRL) integrating Reservoir Computing (RC), Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs).

In ER-MRL, an evolutionary algorithm optimizes hyperparameters that generate recurrent neural networks called reservoirs. These reservoirs process an RL agent's observations before feeding them to the policy network. Thus, the reservoir acts as an evolutionary-scale adaptation, while the policy network learns through RL during "development".

There are two nested loops:
- Outer loop (evolutionary scale): Evolves reservoirs using an EA to maximize future RL performance 
- Inner loop (developmental scale): Learns a policy using RL and reservoir states as input to maximize a reward signal

Main Contributions:

1. Demonstrates reservoirs evolved using ER-MRL can:
   - Solve partially observable tasks by reconstructing missing information
   - Generate oscillatory dynamics that aid locomotion task learning
   - Improve generalization to new unseen tasks compared to RL baselines

2. Provides a computational framework integrating RC, Meta-RL and EAs to model the complex interplay between evolution and lifelong learning.

3. Shows promise for reservoirs to act as fast-adapting, meta-learned modules within agents that facilitate solving a variety of RL problems.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach combining ideas from multiple subfields to investigate how neural structures optimized by evolution can enhance behavioral adaptation over an agent's lifetime. The results support key hypotheses about the benefits of this approach.
