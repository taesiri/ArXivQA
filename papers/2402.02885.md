# [A Review on Building Blocks of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02885)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Centralized AI (CEAI) systems controlled by big tech companies raise issues like lack of transparency, privacy risks, vendor lock-in, and single points of failure. 
- There is growing interest in decentralized AI (DEAI) to address these problems but research is scattered across domains and does not provide a unified view of the key building blocks.

Methodology:
- The authors performed a systematic literature review to analyze the state of DEAI research. 
- They searched academic databases and gray literature to identify 71 relevant papers. 
- These papers were analyzed to identify core building blocks, features, challenges and evaluation methods of DEAI systems.

Key Findings - Building Blocks:
- 13 building blocks were identified such as registries, incentives, marketplaces, reputation systems, ontologies, discoverability, training, inference, ownership mechanisms, data management, governance, cryptography/privacy, and identity.
- Features like standards, security and transparency were also highlighted along with the challenge of updating global models.

Contributions:  
- Provided a bottom-up analysis to identify the building blocks required to construct DEAI systems.
- Presented the first systematic literature review focused specifically on DEAI networks.  
- Proposed guidelines for designing and evaluating future decentralized AI solutions.

The paper helps synthesize research on DEAI systems and provides a reference architecture encompassing the key components needed to enable decentralized and democratized progress in AI. It can inform both researchers and developers working in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper performs a systematic literature review of decentralized artificial intelligence research, identifying 13 core building blocks, 3 key features, 1 main challenge, and various evaluation methods that constitute decentralized AI solutions in order to provide guidelines for designing and assessing future networks and systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is:

1. A comprehensive systematic literature review and analysis of the decentralized artificial intelligence (DEAI) field. 
2. The identification of 13 core building blocks that constitute DEAI networks and solutions, which can serve as guidelines for designing new solutions. These building blocks cover critical components like registries, incentivization, marketplaces, reputation systems, etc.
3. The identification of different metrics and methods to evaluate DEAI systems from different perspectives, such as security, transparency, updatability of models, etc.
4. The identification of significant open issues and challenges in the DEAI field that should be explored more in future research, such as distributed model training, privacy-preserving techniques, decentralized identity, and decentralized data management.

In summary, the paper provides a structured, bottom-up analysis of the DEAI landscape by identifying modular building blocks, evaluation approaches, features, and open problems that researchers should consider when developing decentralized and distributed AI systems. The building blocks and guidelines could help advance this field towards production-ready solutions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methodology proposed in this paper:

1. This paper employs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology. What are some of the key benefits of using an SLR compared to a traditional literature review for analyzing research in the field of decentralized AI (DEAI)?

2. The authors formulate 4 specific research questions (RQs) to guide their SLR. In your opinion, is there any key aspect related to DEAI architectures or solutions that is not covered under these RQs? 

3. The paper searches 7 literature sources covering scientific databases and gray literature. Do you think searching any additional sources could have further enriched the SLR findings? If yes, what other sources should have been considered?

4. The search string employs Boolean AND/OR operators connecting relevant keywords. In your assessment, is the search string comprehensive enough to retrieve most relevant literature on DEAI networks? If not, what additional terms could be included?  

5. The authors screen papers on various attributes during the review process, including building blocks, features, challenges etc. In your opinion, is there any other important attribute that should have been extracted to better characterize DEAI solutions?

6. The paper identifies 13 building blocks of DEAI networks based on the literature analyzed. Do you think any of these building blocks are overlapping in function or can be merged into a single building block? Justify your view.  

7. The paper highlights certain building blocks like identity, ontology and reputation as relatively less explored in existing DEAI literature. In your opinion, which of these building blocks needs deeper research and why?  

8. The SLR identifies 71 relevant papers on DEAI networks published over 1990-2022. Based on Figure 8 presented, how would you characterize the progress made in DEAI networks research over the last 5 years?  

9. The authors recommend more collaboration between industry and academia to strengthen DEAI research. What are some practical ways this cross-collaboration could occur? What role should open-source development play?

10. The paper takes a bottom-up approach to identify building blocks of DEAI networks. In your view, what are some limitations of focusing only on individual building blocks instead of a top-down approach to architecting complete DEAI solutions?
