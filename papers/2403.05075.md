# [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Molecule Prediction Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05075)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, but their potential in broader fields like biology and chemistry remains largely unexplored. Specifically, it's unclear if LLMs can effectively handle molecule prediction tasks critical for drug discovery and materials science.  

- LLMs rely purely on unstructured text inputs and struggle to incorporate key geometric structure information about molecules that is crucial for accurate property predictions. Overcoming this limitation is an open challenge.

Methodology:
- The authors evaluate LLMs on classification and regression tasks across 6 molecular datasets, using carefully designed prompts to query LLMs for predictions. 

- LLM predictions are compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models including text-based models and graph neural networks that explicitly capture molecular structures.

- Different prompting strategies are explored including zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and providing molecular descriptions. 

- Frameworks to integrate LLM predictions as auxiliary features into graph neural networks are introduced and evaluated.

Key Findings:
- LLMs lag significantly behind state-of-the-art ML models, especially structure-aware models, highlighting constraints in comprehension of graphical data.

- Augmenting prompts with molecular descriptions does not boost LLM performance, indicating conversions of graphs to text are insufficient.

- Integrating LLM predictions into ML models leads to noticeable improvements, suggesting promise as complementary tools rather than stand-alone solutions.

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis evaluating ability of LLMs to address molecule prediction tasks, using extensive experiments on multiple datasets

- Demonstration of limitations of current LLM architectures in encoding crucial geometric information 

- Introduction of simple yet effective frameworks to utilize LLMs to enhance existing ML models for molecule property prediction

- Provides direction for developing specialized LLMs and representations better suited for addressing chemistry problems
