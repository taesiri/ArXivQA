# [Double machine learning for causal hybrid modeling -- applications in   the Earth sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13332)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hybrid models combine machine learning with scientific knowledge to improve interpretability, generalization, and adherence to natural laws. But they face challenges like equifinality (multiple models fit data equally well) and regularization biases.

- Existing hybrid modeling approaches like physics-informed neural networks can introduce bias on physical parameters. And choosing different input variables can lead to different interpretations of parameters.

- The goal is to estimate "causal effects" of variables rather than just correlations for more meaningful and robust interpretations. This requires explicitly defining causal relationships.

Solution:
- The paper proposes a "causal hybrid modeling" framework using Double Machine Learning (DML) from econometrics to estimate causal effects. 

- It transforms the problem into a regression of form: Y = θ(X)*f(T) + g(X,W), where T is the input variable whose causal effect θ on Y is to be estimated. f(T) is a known transformation of T.

- DML is used to obtain consistent estimates of θ even with incorrect g estimators. It avoids bias from regularization and allows statistical inference.

Contributions:  

- Show DML hybrid modeling is superior to gradient-descent hybrid modeling in estimating parameters like temperature sensitivity Q10. More efficient, robust, avoids equifinality.

- DML approach extended to estimate heterogeneous causal effects. Used to estimate light-use-efficiency for CO2 flux partitioning. Competitive performance to neural networks.

- Emphasizes defining explicit causal graphs. Solves ill-posed problems like the Q10 model. Advocates causality for interpretable and trustworthy knowledge-guided ML.

- Overall, introduces causal effect estimation to hybrid modeling for well-posed problems, robust inference of physical parameters, avoiding equifinality and regularization biases.
