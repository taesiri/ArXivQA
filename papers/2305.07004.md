# [Not All Languages Are Created Equal in LLMs: Improving Multilingual
  Capability by Cross-Lingual-Thought Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07004)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my review, the key research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we improve the multilingual capability of large language models (LLMs) in order to enhance their performance across diverse languages, particularly for non-English and low-resource languages?

The central hypothesis is that by introducing a generic prompt template called cross-lingual thought prompting (XLTP), the capabilities of LLMs can be significantly enhanced for multilingual tasks without needing to update the model parameters. 

Specifically, the XLTP template is designed to guide the LLM through logical reasoning steps to stimulate cross-lingual thinking and task execution abilities. The hypothesis is that this approach will boost performance on multilingual tasks across languages regardless of variations in the input queries and target responses.

The paper conducts comprehensive evaluations on 7 representative benchmarks covering 27 languages to test this hypothesis. The results demonstrate that XLTP consistently improves performance over baseline prompting methods, even enabling over 10 point gains on average for certain tasks. The approach also reduces gaps between average and best performance per task across languages. 

In summary, the key research question is how to enhance LLM multilingual performance, particularly for non-English and low-resource languages, and the central hypothesis is that cross-lingual thought prompting provides an effective approach to achieving this goal. The experiments aim to demonstrate the capabilities of XLTP in boosting LLM performance across diverse languages and tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a generic prompt template called cross-lingual-thought prompting (XLT) to improve the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1. XLT is a simple yet effective prompt that stimulates cross-lingual and logical reasoning skills of LLMs to enhance their performance on diverse multilingual tasks.

2. Comprehensive evaluations on 7 representative benchmarks covering 27 languages demonstrate XLT can significantly boost LLMs' performance on reasoning, understanding, and generation tasks in both high-resource and low-resource languages. 

3. XLT reduces the performance gap between languages on these benchmarks, indicating its potential to democratize language intelligence in LLMs.

4. Analysis of the factors affecting XLT's generality highlights the effectiveness of cross-language thinking instruction for multilingual knowledge processing in LLMs.

5. XLT provides a convenient and practical approach to handling multilingual tasks using LLMs without requiring additional translation stages.

In summary, this paper proposes XLT as an effective and generic prompt template to systematically improve the multilingual capabilities of LLMs, which is validated through extensive experiments and analysis. The incorporation of cross-lingual reasoning is a key factor empowering LLMs to better process and leverage knowledge across languages.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- Scope and Approach: This paper presents a novel cross-lingual prompting method called Cross-Lingual-Thought Prompting (XLTP) to improve the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It focuses specifically on enhancing performance across multiple languages rather than just English. Many prior works have explored prompt engineering or multilingual training, but this paper uniquely targets cross-lingual prompting to activate reasoning and transfer knowledge between languages. The approach taken is simple yet effective.

- Evaluation: The authors conduct a very comprehensive evaluation across 7 representative multilingual benchmarks covering diverse tasks like reasoning, understanding, and generation. The benchmarks encompass 27 languages, including both high and low resource languages. This extensive evaluation allows robust analysis of the method's effectiveness and language generality. In contrast, most prior work evaluates on 1-2 tasks or just high resource languages.  

- Results: XLTP demonstrates significant gains over strong baselines on all tasks and languages under zero-shot and few-shot settings. Impressively, it achieves over 10 points average improvement in arithmetic reasoning and open-domain QA. The gains are shown to be consistent regardless of language frequency. The method also helps democratize capabilities across languages by reducing performance gaps. Many previous methods only show results on select languages or tasks.

- Analysis: The paper provides an in-depth analysis into factors affecting XLTP's generality across tasks and languages. It studies the contribution of each component through ablation studies and highlights that cross-lingual thinking is particularly crucial. Such detailed analysis about prompting factors is missing in a lot of related work.

Overall, I find this paper conducts more rigorous evaluation across more languages, tasks, and settings compared to related works. The consistent and sizable gains demonstrate the efficacy of cross-lingual prompting as a general approach to enhancing LLM multilingual capabilities. The thorough analysis also provides useful insights.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust and scalable evaluation benchmarks and protocols to thoroughly assess the capabilities and limitations of large language models across diverse languages, modalities, and tasks. The authors highlight the need for more comprehensive multilingual evaluation suites as well as carefully constructed adversarial evaluations.

- Advancing methods for few-shot and zero-shot prompting to unlock the multilingual potential of large language models without requiring parameter updates or gradient steps. The cross-lingual thought prompting approach proposed in this paper could be further enhanced and generalized.

- Exploring techniques to reduce the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages when using large language models. The authors suggest continuing to develop methods to improve multilingual processing in low-resource languages.

- Analyzing and mitigating social biases that may be encoded in the large training corpora of multilingual models to ensure fair and equitable language generation across diverse linguistic and cultural groups.

- Developing efficient and accessible methods to utilize large language models for broader communities, including support for interactive conversational interfaces in many languages.

- Further investigating the inner workings of large multilingual models through analysis techniques such as probing classifiers to gain insights into their linguistic knowledge and reasoning processes.

In summary, the main directions cover improvements in evaluation, prompting methods, support for low-resource languages, bias mitigation, accessibility, and interpretability. Advancing research in these areas could help democratize the benefits of large language models across languages, cultures, and modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a method called cross-lingual-thought prompting (XLTP) to improve the multilingual capability of large language models (LLMs). Although LLMs exhibit impressive performance, they still have limitations in non-English and low-resource languages, leading to imbalanced capabilities across languages. XLTP is a generic prompt template that guides LLMs to enhance multilingual task performance through logical instructions involving problem understanding, cross-lingual thinking, task analysis, task execution, and output formatting within a single-turn conversation. Comprehensive evaluations on 7 representative benchmarks covering 27 languages show XLTP significantly boosts LLM performance on reasoning, understanding, and generation tasks for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Notably, XLTP achieves over 10 points average improvement on arithmetic reasoning and open-domain question answering. Experimental results also indicate XLTP successfully reduces the performance gap between the average and best language per task. Detailed analyses further demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-language thinking instruction for improving LLM multilingual knowledge processing. Overall, XLTP provides an effective and convenient approach to enhancing LLM multilingual capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new method called cross-lingual-thought prompting (XLTP) to improve the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown impressive capabilities across languages, their performance is not equal across all languages, particularly for low-resource languages. To address this imbalance, XLTP provides a generic prompt template that enables LLMs to perform logical reasoning across languages through a single-turn conversation. 

The XLTP template incorporates six key instructions: assigning the LLM an expert role, inputting the task, cross-lingual thinking by rephrasing the input, analyzing the task goal, solving the task in a step-by-step manner, and formatting the output. Evaluations conducted on 7 representative benchmarks across 27 languages demonstrate XLTP's effectiveness. It significantly enhances LLM performance on reasoning, understanding, and generation tasks. XLTP also reduces the performance gap between languages, with over 10 point average gains on arithmetic reasoning and open-domain QA tasks. Ablation studies validate the logic and necessity of each XLTP component. The cross-lingual thinking instruction proves particularly crucial for activating LLM knowledge. Overall, XLTP offers an effective approach to universally improve LLM multilingual capabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a generic prompt template called cross-lingual thought prompting (XLT) to improve the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs). XLT is designed as a natural language instruction that guides the LLM to solve tasks across different languages through a logical process involving understanding the input, thinking cross-lingually, analyzing the task, executing the task step-by-step, and formatting the output. Specifically, XLT incorporates six key instructions: assigning the LLM an expert role, inputting the task request, encouraging cross-lingual thinking by rephrasing the input in English, analyzing the task goal, solving the task in a chain of thought, and formatting the output constraint. This generic template uses placeholders to dynamically adapt to various multilingual tasks. The method is evaluated on seven representative benchmarks covering different capabilities (reasoning, understanding, generation) and 27 languages. Results show XLT significantly improves model performance over basic prompting and reduces the gap between average score and best score per task across languages. The cross-lingual thinking in XLT is found to be particularly effective.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of imbalance in language processing abilities of large language models (LLMs) across different languages. Specifically, it aims to improve the multilingual capability of LLMs and reduce performance gaps between languages. 

The key questions/problems it tries to tackle are:

- LLMs exhibit varying capabilities in handling different languages, leading to unbalanced processing abilities across languages. Most research has focused on English, so it's unclear how well models generalize to other languages.

- There is a need to enhance LLMs' capabilities for non-English and low-resource languages to "democratize" language intelligence and minimize performance gaps between languages. 

- Prompting is sensitive to task/language variations. Existing prompts are often designed for monolingual tasks. How can we develop a generic, language-independent prompt to universally boost multilingual capabilities?

- What factors affect the generality and effectiveness of such a universal prompt in handling multilingual tasks? How can cross-lingual thinking aid in multilingual knowledge processing?

In summary, the paper aims to develop a prompt (mPrompt) to stimulate cross-lingual thinking and reasoning to improve LLMs' performance across languages, tasks, and modalities. It examines mPrompt's ability to enhance multilingual capabilities as well as reduce gaps between languages.
