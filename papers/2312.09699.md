# [Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural Rules: Compilation and   Reasoning (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The rise of AI systems is raising concerns about their potential negative impacts stemming from their behavior or decisions. These systems need to comply with social, legal, ethical, empathetic and cultural (SLEEC) norms. 
- SLEEC rules proposed by Townsend et al. aim to facilitate the formulation and enforcement of such norms, but they are expressed in natural language. To effectively use them in AI systems, there is a need to systematically translate them into a formal language that enables automated reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a linguistic analysis of the SLEEC rules pattern, showing they can be translated into classical logic. 
- Present a scheme to translate SLEEC rules into logical formulas, establishing their formal semantics.
- Investigate complexity of reasoning with SLEEC rules. Show it is intractable in general but identify restrictions that make it tractable.
- Demonstrate the application of compiled SLEEC rules for automated normative reasoning using SAT solvers, Answer Set Programming and Prolog.

Main Contributions:
- A systematic approach to translate SLEEC rules elicited in natural language into classical logic, facilitating their integration in SLEEC-sensitive AI systems. 
- Formal semantics established for SLEEC rules via their logical compilation.
- Complexity results showing reasoning is intractable unless restrictions are imposed.
- Readily applicable strategies presented to implement SLEEC rules using off-the-shelf reasoning tools like SAT solvers and logic programming frameworks.

In summary, the paper bridges the gap between natural language formulation of SLEEC rules and their realization on AI platforms, enabling the engineering of systems compliant with established social, legal and ethical norms.
