# [Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, and Cultural Rules: Compilation and   Reasoning (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09699)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The rise of AI systems is raising concerns about their potential negative impacts stemming from their behavior or decisions. These systems need to comply with social, legal, ethical, empathetic and cultural (SLEEC) norms. 
- SLEEC rules proposed by Townsend et al. aim to facilitate the formulation and enforcement of such norms, but they are expressed in natural language. To effectively use them in AI systems, there is a need to systematically translate them into a formal language that enables automated reasoning.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct a linguistic analysis of the SLEEC rules pattern, showing they can be translated into classical logic. 
- Present a scheme to translate SLEEC rules into logical formulas, establishing their formal semantics.
- Investigate complexity of reasoning with SLEEC rules. Show it is intractable in general but identify restrictions that make it tractable.
- Demonstrate the application of compiled SLEEC rules for automated normative reasoning using SAT solvers, Answer Set Programming and Prolog.

Main Contributions:
- A systematic approach to translate SLEEC rules elicited in natural language into classical logic, facilitating their integration in SLEEC-sensitive AI systems. 
- Formal semantics established for SLEEC rules via their logical compilation.
- Complexity results showing reasoning is intractable unless restrictions are imposed.
- Readily applicable strategies presented to implement SLEEC rules using off-the-shelf reasoning tools like SAT solvers and logic programming frameworks.

In summary, the paper bridges the gap between natural language formulation of SLEEC rules and their realization on AI platforms, enabling the engineering of systems compliant with established social, legal and ethical norms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points made in the paper:

The paper presents a systematic approach for translating social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) rules that are elicited from domain experts into classical logic, studies the computational complexity of reasoning with these rules, and shows how logic programming frameworks can be readily employed to implement SLEEC-compliant decision making in AI systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents a systematic approach for translating social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) rules into classical logic. The key contributions are:

1) It provides a linguistic and logical analysis of the structure of SLEEC rules, specifically the "unless...in which case..." pattern, and formally defines how to translate them into propositional logic. 

2) It investigates the computational complexity of reasoning with SLEEC rules, showing that general reasoning is coNP-complete, but special cases can be easier.

3) It demonstrates how the logical form of SLEEC rules can be used for automated reasoning and decision-making in logic programming frameworks like Answer Set Programming and Prolog. This allows the rules to be seamlessly integrated into AI systems. 

Overall, the paper bridges the gap between natural language SLEEC rules and machine-interpretable logical rules, facilitating the development of AI systems that conform to the norms articulated in the SLEEC rules. The logic-based compilation provides a precise semantics for the rules and enables practical reasoning applications.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- SLEEC rules - Social, Legal, Ethical, Empathetic, Cultural rules that govern the behavior of AI systems. These rules are elicited from domain experts and formulated in natural language.

- Compilation - The process of translating SLEEC rules from natural language into a logical representation that is amenable to automated reasoning. 

- Propositional logic - A formal logic used to represent compiled SLEEC rules. Allows determining consistency and entailment relations between rules.

- Logic programming - Paradigms like Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Prolog that provide implementation frameworks for reasoning about compiled SLEEC rules. Help integrate rules into practical AI systems.  

- Computational complexity - Analysis of reasoning complexity about SLEEC rules. Shows it is intractable in general but identifies restrictions that make reasoning tractable.

- Automated reasoning - Using theorem proving tools and logic programming systems to automatically determine obligations and permissions entailed by a set of SLEEC rules and context. Enables SLEEC-compliant decision making.

In summary, the key focus is on formally compiling elicited behavioral rules for AI systems into logic, studying computational properties, and leveraging automated reasoning for normative decision making.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper claims that translating SLEEC rules into classical logic endows them with precise semantics. What aspects of classical logic specifically facilitate establishing the precise semantics for SLEEC rules? 

2. The paper argues that 'unless' should not be interpreted as an exclusive OR, but simply as a material implication. What is the key linguistic insight that supports their logical interpretation of 'unless'?

3. Compiling SLEEC rules into classical logic enables machine processing and integration of different reasoning frameworks. What are some examples of specific reasoning frameworks that could be readily integrated as discussed in the paper?

4. What is the theoretical worst-case complexity of reasoning with SLEEC rules as per the analysis in the paper? Under what restrictions can the complexity be lowered to polynomial time?  

5. The paper compiles SLEEC rules by recursively applying the interpretations of 'unless...in which case'. Walk through this compilation process step-by-step for a sample rule with 3 unless clauses.

6. Contrast the logical interpretation of SLEEC rules proposed in this paper to the interpretation implicit in Feng et al.'s tool. What are the key differences and why do they matter?  

7. The paper defines a 'moral filter' based on SLEEC rules to determine suitable actions. Explain this concept and discuss how ontological knowledge about actions becomes necessary.

8. What are the practical advantages of using logic programming frameworks like ASP and Prolog for reasoning with SLEEC rules? Illustrate with suitable examples.

9. How does the rule elicitation process facilitate the translation of SLEEC rules into classical logic? What ambiguities need to be resolved?

10. The paper focuses only on propositional logic while SLEEC rules can be more complex. What extensions would be necessary to handle first-order or modal logic aspects of practical SLEEC rules?
