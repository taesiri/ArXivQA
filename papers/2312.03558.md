## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LongViT, a vision Transformer model capable of processing entire gigapixel images in an end-to-end manner for computational pathology tasks. LongViT splits a gigapixel whole slide image into millions of patches, linearly projects them into embeddings, and models the long sequence using LongNet to capture both local and global context. This overcomes computation and memory constraints. LongViT is pretrained in a self-supervised fashion on 10K whole slide images and finetuned for cancer subtyping and survival prediction across several datasets. Experiments demonstrate LongViTâ€™s ability to effectively encode gigapixel images. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 subtyping and survival prediction tasks, outperforming prior methods. Ablations on input resolution show benefits of larger resolution for most tasks, indicating LongViT leverages the full image context. In summary, LongViT simplifies previous multi-stage approaches to encode gigapixel pathology images into a simple, end-to-end Transformer, achieving strong computational pathology results.

This paper introduces LongViT, a vision Transformer that can process gigapixel images in an end-to-end manner by using LongNet to encode the long sequence of millions of patches obtained by splitting the image, and shows its effectiveness for cancer diagnosis and prognosis tasks in computational pathology.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting LongViT, a vision Transformer that can process gigapixel images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically:

- They split the gigapixel image into a sequence of millions of patches and project them linearly into embeddings. LongNet is then used to model the extremely long sequence, generating representations that capture both short-range and long-range dependencies.

- They apply LongViT to computational pathology for cancer diagnosis and prognosis within gigapixel whole-slide images. Experimental results demonstrate that LongViT effectively encodes gigapixel images and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on cancer subtyping and survival prediction tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an efficient Transformer model (LongViT) that can process entire gigapixel images in an end-to-end fashion and showing its effectiveness on computational pathology tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art approaches.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Applying vision Transformers to process gigapixel images, such as whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, is challenging due to the enormous computation and memory requirements brought by the huge number of pixels. Prior works have limitations in effectively and efficiently encoding gigapixel images in an end-to-end manner.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes LongViT, a vision Transformer that can process gigapixel images end-to-end. LongViT splits the gigapixel image into a sequence of millions of patches and projects them into embeddings. It then employs LongNet, a Transformer variant for modeling very long sequences via dilated attention, to encode the long sequence and obtain representations capturing both short-range and long-range dependencies. LongNet has linear computation complexity and a distributed algorithm that enables LongViT to handle the computation and memory constraints.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes LongViT, the first vision Transformer that can effectively process gigapixel images end-to-end by employing LongNet to encode the long sequence of patch embeddings 
- Overcomes constraints in computation and memory via LongNet's linear complexity and distributed algorithm
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cancer subtyping classification and survival prediction tasks in computational pathology, demonstrating effectiveness in encoding gigapixel WSIs
- Performs ablation studies showing LongViT captures useful representations from larger image resolutions

The key innovation is using LongNet in a simple yet effective way to extend vision Transformers to gigapixel images. LongViT processes the images end-to-end in one stage without complex pipelines or architectures. Experiments show strong empirical results on real-world computational pathology tasks.
