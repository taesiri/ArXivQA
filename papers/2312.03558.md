# [When an Image is Worth 1,024 x 1,024 Words: A Case Study in   Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03558)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LongViT, a vision Transformer model capable of processing entire gigapixel images in an end-to-end manner for computational pathology tasks. LongViT splits a gigapixel whole slide image into millions of patches, linearly projects them into embeddings, and models the long sequence using LongNet to capture both local and global context. This overcomes computation and memory constraints. LongViT is pretrained in a self-supervised fashion on 10K whole slide images and finetuned for cancer subtyping and survival prediction across several datasets. Experiments demonstrate LongViTâ€™s ability to effectively encode gigapixel images. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on 6 subtyping and survival prediction tasks, outperforming prior methods. Ablations on input resolution show benefits of larger resolution for most tasks, indicating LongViT leverages the full image context. In summary, LongViT simplifies previous multi-stage approaches to encode gigapixel pathology images into a simple, end-to-end Transformer, achieving strong computational pathology results.
