# [Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited   Overlapping Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16270)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to develop a practical vertical federated learning (VFL) framework that can simultaneously handle the key challenges of high communication costs and limited overlapping samples between clients. 

The main hypothesis is that by using semi-supervised learning techniques, it is possible to develop a VFL approach that requires minimal communication between clients and server while still achieving high accuracy even when there are few overlapping samples. Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates two VFL frameworks called "one-shot VFL" and "few-shot VFL" that are designed to achieve these goals.

In summary, the key research questions/hypotheses are:

- Can a VFL approach be developed that requires minimal communication between clients, i.e. just one or a few rounds of communication?

- Can semi-supervised learning techniques allow a VFL model to achieve high accuracy even when there are very limited overlapping samples between clients? 

- Is it possible to simultaneously address the challenges of communication efficiency and limited overlapping samples in VFL through the proposed "one-shot" and "few-shot" frameworks?

The paper presents these frameworks and evaluates them empirically on both image and tabular datasets to demonstrate their ability to achieve the goals of minimal communication and high accuracy under limited overlap between clients.
