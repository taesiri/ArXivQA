# [Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited   Overlapping Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16270)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to develop a practical vertical federated learning (VFL) framework that can simultaneously handle the key challenges of high communication costs and limited overlapping samples between clients. 

The main hypothesis is that by using semi-supervised learning techniques, it is possible to develop a VFL approach that requires minimal communication between clients and server while still achieving high accuracy even when there are few overlapping samples. Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates two VFL frameworks called "one-shot VFL" and "few-shot VFL" that are designed to achieve these goals.

In summary, the key research questions/hypotheses are:

- Can a VFL approach be developed that requires minimal communication between clients, i.e. just one or a few rounds of communication?

- Can semi-supervised learning techniques allow a VFL model to achieve high accuracy even when there are very limited overlapping samples between clients? 

- Is it possible to simultaneously address the challenges of communication efficiency and limited overlapping samples in VFL through the proposed "one-shot" and "few-shot" frameworks?

The paper presents these frameworks and evaluates them empirically on both image and tabular datasets to demonstrate their ability to achieve the goals of minimal communication and high accuracy under limited overlap between clients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a communication-efficient vertical federated learning algorithm called "one-shot VFL". This algorithm can address the challenges of high communication cost and limited overlapping samples in VFL simultaneously. 

2. It proposes "few-shot VFL" which is an extension of one-shot VFL. Few-shot VFL can further improve the performance by expanding the supervised dataset on clients with just one additional communication round.

3. It evaluates the proposed methods on both image data (CIFAR-10) and tabular data (UCI credit card dataset). The results show that compared to state-of-the-art VFL methods, the proposed methods can improve accuracy by over 46.5% and reduce communication cost by over 330x on CIFAR-10.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing one-shot and few-shot VFL algorithms that can significantly reduce communication cost and improve performance with limited overlapping samples in vertical federated learning. This is achieved by applying semi-supervised learning techniques and carefully designing the communication protocol between clients and server. The proposed methods are evaluated on both image and tabular data to demonstrate their effectiveness.
