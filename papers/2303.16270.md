# [Communication-Efficient Vertical Federated Learning with Limited   Overlapping Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16270)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper aims to address is how to develop a practical vertical federated learning (VFL) framework that can simultaneously handle the key challenges of high communication costs and limited overlapping samples between clients. 

The main hypothesis is that by using semi-supervised learning techniques, it is possible to develop a VFL approach that requires minimal communication between clients and server while still achieving high accuracy even when there are few overlapping samples. Specifically, the paper proposes and evaluates two VFL frameworks called "one-shot VFL" and "few-shot VFL" that are designed to achieve these goals.

In summary, the key research questions/hypotheses are:

- Can a VFL approach be developed that requires minimal communication between clients, i.e. just one or a few rounds of communication?

- Can semi-supervised learning techniques allow a VFL model to achieve high accuracy even when there are very limited overlapping samples between clients? 

- Is it possible to simultaneously address the challenges of communication efficiency and limited overlapping samples in VFL through the proposed "one-shot" and "few-shot" frameworks?

The paper presents these frameworks and evaluates them empirically on both image and tabular datasets to demonstrate their ability to achieve the goals of minimal communication and high accuracy under limited overlap between clients.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a communication-efficient vertical federated learning algorithm called "one-shot VFL". This algorithm can address the challenges of high communication cost and limited overlapping samples in VFL simultaneously. 

2. It proposes "few-shot VFL" which is an extension of one-shot VFL. Few-shot VFL can further improve the performance by expanding the supervised dataset on clients with just one additional communication round.

3. It evaluates the proposed methods on both image data (CIFAR-10) and tabular data (UCI credit card dataset). The results show that compared to state-of-the-art VFL methods, the proposed methods can improve accuracy by over 46.5% and reduce communication cost by over 330x on CIFAR-10.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing one-shot and few-shot VFL algorithms that can significantly reduce communication cost and improve performance with limited overlapping samples in vertical federated learning. This is achieved by applying semi-supervised learning techniques and carefully designing the communication protocol between clients and server. The proposed methods are evaluated on both image and tabular data to demonstrate their effectiveness.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a vertical federated learning framework called one-shot VFL that can simultaneously address the challenges of high communication costs and limited overlapping samples common in real-world VFL applications, achieving significantly higher accuracy while requiring over 330x less communication compared to prior methods.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in vertical federated learning (VFL):

- This paper proposes novel one-shot and few-shot VFL methods that aim to simultaneously address two major challenges in VFL: high communication costs and limited overlapping samples. Most prior work has focused on addressing one of these challenges.

- For reducing communication costs, this paper achieves much greater reduction compared to prior methods like FedBCD. One-shot VFL requires only 3 communication rounds versus thousands of rounds for vanilla VFL. 

- For limited overlapping samples, this paper's use of semi-supervised learning outperforms prior methods like FedCVT that rely solely on representation estimation/pseudo-labeling. The proposed methods increase accuracy on CIFAR-10 by over 45% versus FedCVT.

- The experiments evaluate VFL methods on both image (CIFAR-10) and tabular (credit default) datasets. Many prior works focus solely on either images or tabular data. The proposed methods demonstrate gains on both data types.

- Privacy preservation is not a focus of this paper. Some other works incorporate differential privacy or encryption to improve privacy. The proposed methods here do not require additional information sharing versus vanilla VFL.

- This paper considers two-client VFL settings. Other works have explored multi-party VFL with more than two clients. Extending the ideas here to multi-client VFL could be interesting future work.

Overall, by jointly addressing communication efficiency and limited samples with semi-supervised learning, this paper makes important contributions compared to prior VFL research focused on one issue. The gains on both image and tabular data highlight the broad applicability of the proposed methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Evaluate the proposed VFL methods in multi-modal settings that combine different data types (e.g. images, text, tabular data). The current work focuses on evaluating with either image data or tabular data separately.

- Further explore potential privacy leakage in VFL and incorporate existing defense methods like differential privacy and encryption into the proposed approaches. The current work does not address privacy directly.

- Evaluate the methods in multi-party settings with more than two clients. The current experiments are limited to two-client scenarios which are common in prior VFL works.

- Make the code publicly available to enable further research building on the proposed methods. 

- Explore more sophisticated semi-supervised learning algorithms tailored for VFL beyond the adapted FixMatch approaches used here.

- Analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the proposed methods. The current work is empirical but does not provide convergence guarantees.

In summary, the key future directions are: multi-modal evaluation, privacy preservation, multi-party VFL, code release, advances in VFL-specific semi-supervised learning, and theoretical convergence analysis. The authors plan to build on this work to address the unique challenges of making VFL practical for real-world deployment.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework called one-shot VFL and few-shot VFL that aims to address two key challenges in VFL - high communication costs and limited overlapping samples between clients. In the proposed methods, clients conduct local semi-supervised learning to train feature extractors using both overlapping samples and their own non-overlapping data. This allows utilizing all client data to learn better features. The key idea is that in one-shot VFL, clients only need to communicate with the server twice - to upload learned features, and once to download gradient information that acts as temporary pseudo-labels. This greatly reduces communication rounds. The few-shot VFL method allows an additional communication round to further improve performance by expanding the labeled dataset on clients. Experiments on image and tabular datasets show the proposed VFL methods can improve accuracy by over 46% and reduce communication cost by over 330x compared to existing VFL algorithms. The main contributions are developing communication-efficient VFL methods that can work well even with limited overlapping user data across clients.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to address two major challenges in VFL: high communication costs and limited overlapping samples. The authors introduce one-shot VFL, where clients only need to communicate with the server once or a few times during training. In one-shot VFL, clients first extract representations of overlapping data and send them to the server. The server computes loss and gradients, then sends gradients back to clients. Clients cluster the gradients to assign temporary labels to overlapping data, then perform semi-supervised learning on the labeled overlapping data and unlabeled local data. After training, clients send updated representations to the server for classifier training. This process requires only two client uploads and one server download. The authors also propose few-shot VFL which adds another communication round to further improve performance by expanding the labeled dataset on clients.

The proposed methods are evaluated on CIFAR-10 image data and a credit default prediction dataset. Results show one-shot VFL improves accuracy by over 46% and reduces communication cost 330x versus baseline VFL methods on CIFAR-10. Few-shot VFL further improves accuracy at the cost of a few more communication rounds. The methods also achieve strong performance on tabular data, reducing communication cost over 10-32x with minor accuracy gains. The key novelty is addressing high communication costs and limited labeled data simultaneously via semi-supervised learning within a highly communication-efficient framework. The work demonstrates VFL can be practical for real-world deployment.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:

The paper proposes a new vertical federated learning (VFL) framework called one-shot VFL to simultaneously address the challenges of high communication cost and limited overlapping samples in VFL. In one-shot VFL, the clients first extract representations of the overlapping data and send them to the server. The server computes partial gradients of the representations and sends them back to the clients. The clients then conduct k-means clustering on the partial gradients to assign temporary labels to the overlapping samples. With the overlapping data now pseudo-labeled, the clients perform local semi-supervised learning on both overlapping and unaligned data to train feature extractors. After this local training, the clients send updated representations of the overlapping data to the server, which trains a classifier. By having the clients perform semi-supervised learning after receiving gradients only once from the server, one-shot VFL drastically reduces communication compared to traditional VFL approaches that require continual communication. It also improves performance with limited overlapping data through leveraging both aligned and unaligned local data in semi-supervised learning. An extension called few-shot VFL is proposed to further improve performance by expanding the pseudo-labeled dataset on clients through another round of communication.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing two key challenges in vertical federated learning (VFL):

1. High communication costs: Standard VFL methods require frequent communication between clients and the server for every iteration of training, which incurs extremely high communication costs. This makes VFL impractical to deploy in many real-world scenarios. 

2. Limited overlapping samples: In many VFL applications, the number of overlapping samples (i.e. samples that have features from all clients) is very small. Existing VFL methods struggle to train accurate models with such limited overlapping data.

The paper proposes a new VFL framework called "one-shot VFL" and an extension called "few-shot VFL" to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. The key ideas are:

- Using semi-supervised learning on the clients to better utilize both overlapping and non-overlapping data for representation learning. This helps deal with limited overlapping samples.

- Drastically reducing communication between clients and server to just 1-2 rounds. This solves the communication bottleneck.

So in summary, the paper addresses the dual challenge of developing a communication-efficient VFL approach that can work well even with minimal overlapping samples, which are common practical constraints for real-world VFL deployment.
