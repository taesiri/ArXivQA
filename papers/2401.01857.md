# [Optimal cross-learning for contextual bandits with unknown context   distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01857)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the contextual bandits problem with "cross-learning". In this setting, the learner observes contexts sampled i.i.d. from an unknown distribution, chooses an action, and observes the loss for that action in all possible contexts, not just the current context. The goal is to design an efficient algorithm that achieves low regret compared to the best policy, without knowing the context distribution. 

Prior work by Balseiro et al. proposed an algorithm that achieves optimal $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ regret when the context distribution is known. However, their algorithm for unknown distributions only achieves $O(T^{2/3})$ regret. Closing this gap was posed as an open problem.

Main Contributions:

1. The paper resolves the open problem by proposing a new efficient algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ regret even with an unknown context distribution. This matches the lower bound up to logarithmic factors.

2. The key ideas involve: (i) a new loss estimator design and analysis based on expected bias instead of high probability bounds, (ii) a novel epoch-based scheduling of the algorithm to reduce correlations between context distribution estimation and actions, (iii) disentangling the playing policy $p_t$ and loss observing policy $q_t$.

3. As applications, the paper obtains nearly tight regret bounds for two problems: (i) learning to bid in first-price auctions with unknown bidder valuation distributions; (ii) sleeping bandits with stochastic availability and adversarial losses.

To summarize, the paper makes significant progress on the open problem by developing a novel algorithm based on disentangling estimation and playing policies across epochs. This leads to optimal cross-learning algorithms and applications for important problems. The techniques developed could have broader impact for other learning problems involving unknown distributions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides an efficient contextual bandits algorithm that achieves an optimal regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ when contexts are stochastically sampled from an unknown distribution, resolving an open problem from prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing an efficient algorithm for the contextual bandits problem with cross-learning between contexts when the context distribution is unknown. Specifically, the paper presents an algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ regret in this setting, nearly matching the lower bound and resolving an open problem from prior work. 

At a high level, the key ideas involve:

1) A novel way of coordinating exploration across epochs to reduce correlations between learning the context distribution and solving the bandit problem. This allows for constructing low-variance unbiased loss estimators.

2) New concentration arguments that avoid needing high probability bounds on the denominators of these loss estimators, and instead only require bounding expectations.

3) Applications of this general algorithm to obtain nearly tight regret bounds for the problems of learning to bid in first-price auctions and sleeping bandits with stochastic action sets.

So in summary, the main contribution is an efficient algorithm for contextual bandits with cross-learning and unknown contexts along with applications to bidding and sleeping bandits. The techniques developed to handle the challenges of the unknown distribution setting may also find broader use.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key terms and concepts:

- Contextual bandits - The paper studies algorithms for the contextual bandits problem, where the learner receives a context each round and selects an action, only observing the reward for that action.

- Cross-learning - The paper considers a variant where the learner observes the loss/reward for the chosen action across all possible contexts, allowing for "cross-learning" between contexts. 

- Unknown context distribution - A key focus is settings where the distribution over contexts is unknown to the learner.

- Regret bounds - The paper provides algorithms with regret bounds compared to the best policy, that is nearly optimal (up to logarithmic factors).

- Epoch-based learning - The algorithm divides time into epochs and coordinates learning across epochs to remove correlations that interfere with learning the context distribution.

- Applications - The techniques are applied to real problems like bidding in first-price auctions and sleeping bandits.

- Efficient algorithms - The paper provides computationally efficient algorithms for these problems that nearly match information-theoretic lower bounds.

Key terms: contextual bandits, cross-learning, unknown distributions, regret bounds, epoch-based learning, applications, efficiency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel technique for coordinating the execution of a learning algorithm over multiple epochs. Can you explain in more detail how this technique helps remove correlations between estimation of the unknown distribution and the actions played by the algorithm? What are the key ideas that enable this?

2. When constructing the loss estimators $\hat{\ell}_{t k}$, the paper uses a different set of rounds for computing the frequency estimators $\hat{f}_{e k}$ and the loss estimators. Can you walk through why this separation is important? What issues would arise if the same rounds were used for both estimators?

3. The analysis relies on defining "proxy" random variables $\tilde{\ell}_{t c k}$ and $\tilde{p}_{t c k}$ that are independent of certain key estimators conditioned on the epoch. Walk through the motivation and construction of these proxy variables and how they simplify the analysis. 

4. Explain the high-level intuition for why directly replacing the true context distribution with the empirical distribution in existing algorithms fails. What specific challenges arise and how does the method introduced here address them?

5. The paper claims the technique may be of independent interest for other learning problems involving estimation of an unknown context distribution. What other types of problems could you imagine this being useful for? How might the technique need to be adapted?

6. Walk through the analysis bounding each of the terms $\text{bias}_1$, $\text{bias}_2$, $\text{bias}_3$, and $\text{ftrl}$. What is the main approach or technique used to bound each one and why? 

7. The regret bound proven in the paper matches existing lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Do you think it is possible to improve the analysis to entirely close this gap? If so, what techniques could help tighten the bounds?

8. How does the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm compare to prior approaches? Under what conditions can the runtime be optimized further?

9. Discuss the connections between this work and some of the related problems studied previously, like sleeping bandits and bidding in first-price auctions. How does the regret compare?

10. The technique relies on several key parameters that need to be set in a careful way. Walk through the conditions and tradeoffs involved in tuning these parameters. In particular, discuss the settings of $\eta$, $\gamma$, $L$, and $\iota$.
