# [BiFF: Bi-level Future Fusion with Polyline-based Coordinate for   Interactive Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14161)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research focus of this paper is on developing a model for interactive trajectory prediction that can explicitly capture future interactions between agents. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) approach to model interactions at both high-level future intentions and low-level future behaviors. 

The central hypothesis is that by fusing information about future interactions at two levels - intentions and behaviors - the model can generate more accurate and scene-consistent trajectory predictions for multiple interactive agents.

The key research questions addressed are:

- How to effectively fuse high-level future intentions between agents to produce scene-consistent goals? This is handled by the proposed High-level Future Intentions Fusion (HFIF) module.

- How to fuse low-level future trajectory behaviors across agents to ensure collision avoidance and scene compliance? This is addressed through the Low-level Future Behaviors Fusion (LFBF) module.

- How to design an efficient coordinate representation that provides agent-centric features without redundant context encoding? The polyline-based coordinate is proposed for this purpose.

In summary, the core research focus is on modeling interactive trajectory prediction by fusing future interactions at both high-level intentions and low-level behaviors using the proposed BiFF approach. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling these future interactions will lead to more accurate and human-like predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel model called BiFF (Bi-level Future Fusion) for interactive trajectory prediction. BiFF incorporates two components: 

- High-level Future Intentions Fusion (HFIF): Captures future intentions across agents to generate scene-consistent goals.

- Low-level Future Behaviors Fusion (LFBF): Fuses future behaviors across agents in each scene modality to predict scene-compliant trajectories.

2. It designs a polyline-based coordinate system specifically for multi-agent prediction. This representation provides agent-centric features without redundant context encoding between agents, making the model more memory-efficient, data-efficient and robust to variance in global reference frame.

3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the interactive prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling future interactions with the proposed BiFF framework and polyline-based coordinates.

In summary, the key contribution is a new model BiFF that explicitly captures bi-level future interactions (intentions and behaviors) between agents using novel components like HFIF and LFBF. The polyline-based coordinates also enhance the multi-agent prediction. Experiments verify the state-of-the-art performance of BiFF for interactive trajectory forecasting.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) that captures future interactions between agents by fusing high-level future intentions and low-level future behaviors using polyline-based coordinates for efficient and accurate multi-agent trajectory prediction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper on Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) compares to other recent research on interactive trajectory prediction:

- BiFF explicitly models future interactions between agents through both high-level intention fusion (HFIF) and low-level behavior fusion (LFBF). Most prior work focuses on modeling past interactions and does not directly capture future interactivity. 

- The polyline-based coordinate representation used in BiFF provides agent-centric predictions without redundant context encoding between targets. Other methods tend to use scene-centric representations which require re-normalization for each agent.

- Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate BiFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on interactive prediction benchmarks, outperforming recent methods like M2I, DenseTNT, and SceneTransformer.

- BiFF incorporates iterative trajectory refinement during prediction through its LFBF decoder. Some other approaches like M2I and MTR have explored future prediction for refinement, but do not refine trajectories over multiple iterations.

- The HFIF module in BiFF uses a novel multi-modal decoder to decompose the multi-modal marginal intentions into uni-modal goals for each agent in each scene modality. This helps resolve conflicts in the marginal predictions.

- BiFF is designed specifically for joint prediction of two interactive agents. Some recent work like SceneTransformer and AutoBots focus on flexible modeling of diverse multi-agent scenarios.

In summary, BiFF advances the state-of-the-art in interactive trajectory prediction through its novel future fusion mechanisms, efficient coordinate representation, strong experimental results, and techniques like iterative refinement and multi-modal conflict resolution. It provides a new approach to tackling the key challenges in modeling interactivity for autonomous navigation.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving the performance on mean average precision (mAP). The paper notes there is still a gap between their method BiFF and state-of-the-art on mAP. They suggest this could be addressed by training the model to predict a score for each agent supervised with soft labels, rather than training the marginal heatmap separately. The joint score can then be obtained by multiplying the scores of all agents.

- Scaling up the model with more training data and parameters. The authors state the current version of BiFF is small, so increasing the model capacity and training data could further enhance performance.

- Extending BiFF to handle more than two interactive agents. The paper notes their approach can likely be extended to multi-agent prediction with more than two targets by using techniques like sparse attention to reduce computation.

- Exploring other potential applications of the Bi-level Future Fusion idea beyond just trajectory prediction. For example, in simulation and planning for autonomous vehicles where having scene-consistent predicted trajectories could be useful.

- Investigating how to better model complex, long-term interactions over longer time horizons. The current 8s prediction may not capture very long-term strategic planning.

- Incorporating more diverse scene context beyond just vectorized map information, such as raw sensor data. This could help the model handle more complex scenarios.

- Validating the approach on other autonomous driving datasets besides just Waymo to show broader applicability.

In summary, the main future directions are improving performance, scaling up the model, extending to more agents, exploring other applications, handling more complex interactions, incorporating richer context, and more rigorous testing on diverse datasets. The core idea of Bi-level Future Fusion seems promising to build upon.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF), a novel approach for multi-agent trajectory prediction that models future interactions between agents. BiFF incorporates two fusion mechanisms: High-level Future Intentions Fusion (HFIF) that fuses agents' high-level future goals/intentions, and Low-level Future Behaviors Fusion (LFBF) that fuses agents' low-level future behavior trajectories. HFIF allows generating scene-consistent goals by exchanging future intentions between agents, while LFBF iteratively refines the predicted trajectories by fusing future behaviors across agents in each scene modality. The method represents the driving scene using polyline-based coordinates, which provides an agent-centric representation to achieve robustness and avoid redundant context encoding. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing the benefits of modeling future interactions and using polyline-based coordinates. The proposed BiFF advances multi-agent trajectory prediction by explicitly modeling future interactions and designing appropriate scene representations.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel model called Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) for interactive trajectory prediction of multiple autonomous agents. BiFF incorporates two key components: High-level Future Intentions Fusion (HFIF) and Low-level Future Behaviors Fusion (LFBF). HFIF is used to fuse high-level future goals and intentions across agents. It takes future intention heatmaps as input and applies a transformer decoder to generate scene-consistent goals for each agent in different modalities. LFBF fuses low-level future trajectory behaviors across agents in each scene modality. It uses a transformer decoder to iteratively refine predicted trajectories by aggregating context and fusing future behaviors between agents. 

BiFF represents the driving scene using polyline-based coordinates, where each agent and road is normalized to its own reference frame. This allows sharing of context features between agents and achieves agent-centric prediction invariant to global transformations. Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. The ablation studies validate the importance of each key component in BiFF. The polyline-based coordinates are shown to enhance data efficiency, save memory, and improve robustness compared to scene-centric approaches. Overall, BiFF advances interactive trajectory prediction by explicitly modeling future interactions at both high-level intentions and low-level behaviors in a memory-efficient and accurate manner.
