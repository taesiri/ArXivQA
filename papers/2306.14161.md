# [BiFF: Bi-level Future Fusion with Polyline-based Coordinate for   Interactive Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14161)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the key research focus of this paper is on developing a model for interactive trajectory prediction that can explicitly capture future interactions between agents. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) approach to model interactions at both high-level future intentions and low-level future behaviors. 

The central hypothesis is that by fusing information about future interactions at two levels - intentions and behaviors - the model can generate more accurate and scene-consistent trajectory predictions for multiple interactive agents.

The key research questions addressed are:

- How to effectively fuse high-level future intentions between agents to produce scene-consistent goals? This is handled by the proposed High-level Future Intentions Fusion (HFIF) module.

- How to fuse low-level future trajectory behaviors across agents to ensure collision avoidance and scene compliance? This is addressed through the Low-level Future Behaviors Fusion (LFBF) module.

- How to design an efficient coordinate representation that provides agent-centric features without redundant context encoding? The polyline-based coordinate is proposed for this purpose.

In summary, the core research focus is on modeling interactive trajectory prediction by fusing future interactions at both high-level intentions and low-level behaviors using the proposed BiFF approach. The key hypothesis is that explicitly modeling these future interactions will lead to more accurate and human-like predictions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel model called BiFF (Bi-level Future Fusion) for interactive trajectory prediction. BiFF incorporates two components: 

- High-level Future Intentions Fusion (HFIF): Captures future intentions across agents to generate scene-consistent goals.

- Low-level Future Behaviors Fusion (LFBF): Fuses future behaviors across agents in each scene modality to predict scene-compliant trajectories.

2. It designs a polyline-based coordinate system specifically for multi-agent prediction. This representation provides agent-centric features without redundant context encoding between agents, making the model more memory-efficient, data-efficient and robust to variance in global reference frame.

3. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on the interactive prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of modeling future interactions with the proposed BiFF framework and polyline-based coordinates.

In summary, the key contribution is a new model BiFF that explicitly captures bi-level future interactions (intentions and behaviors) between agents using novel components like HFIF and LFBF. The polyline-based coordinates also enhance the multi-agent prediction. Experiments verify the state-of-the-art performance of BiFF for interactive trajectory forecasting.
