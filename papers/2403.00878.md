# [Crimson: Empowering Strategic Reasoning in Cybersecurity through Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00878)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Integrating vulnerability data like CVEs and threat intelligence with the MITRE ATT&CK framework is challenging but critical for enhancing security strategies. CVEs and CTIs are unstructured, making analysis difficult, while ATT&CK provides a standardized framework for understanding adversary behavior. Automating the mapping of CVEs to ATT&CK techniques can aid threat analysis and mitigation.

Solution - Crimson System:
The paper proposes Crimson, a system to improve the strategic reasoning of language models within cybersecurity by correlating CVEs with ATT&CK techniques. Key aspects include:

- Defining cybersecurity strategic reasoning tasks and evaluation metrics like F1 score, IOU, hallucination rate.
- Developing the CVE-ATT&CK Mapping (CVEM) dataset through a data synthesis workflow using GPT-4 and expert human feedback.
- Enhancing language models via Retrieval-Aware Training (RAT) which integrates real-time data retrieval.
- Employing a domain-specific embedding model for differentiating between superficially similar threats.

Main Contributions:

- First dataset for assessing cybersecurity strategic reasoning capabilities.
- RAT and an advanced version called RAT-R to improve smaller models' reasoning abilities. 
- Demonstrating Crimson with 7B parameters approaches GPT-4 performance but with lower hallucination and errors.
- Confirming efficacy of domain-specific tuning for improving reasoning accuracy in cybersecurity contexts.

Overall, Crimson integrates vulnerability data with threat models to enable better threat anticipation and strategic decision making for security. The techniques boost language models' capabilities for this complex task.
