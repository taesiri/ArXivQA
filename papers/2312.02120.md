# [Magicoder: Source Code Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02120)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces Magicoder, a series of fully open-source language models for code that significantly close the performance gap with proprietary models like ChatGPT while using under 7B parameters. The key innovation is OSS-Instruct, a method that leverages LLMs to generate high-quality and diverse coding problems and solutions inspired by random code snippets from open source codebases. This allows the models to learn from a wide range of realistic programming scenarios. The resulting synthetic dataset of 75K problems is used to finetune CodeLLAMA and DeepSeekCoder base models, creating the Magicoder and MagicoderX variants. Extensive evaluations show Magicoder models outperforming all studied open source baselines with similar model sizes, rivaling 15B models, and in some cases even surpassing ChatGPT. MagicoderX combines OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct for further improvements. The fully open availability of the models aims to spur future research in open source LLMs for code.
