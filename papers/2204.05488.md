# [Overlapping Word Removal is All You Need: Revisiting Data Imbalance in   Hope Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05488)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve hope speech detection using Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) by addressing issues related to data imbalance, word overlap, and inadequate data preprocessing?The key hypotheses implied in the paper are:1) Training M-BERT with focal loss instead of cross-entropy loss can help mitigate the class imbalance issue and improve performance on the minority hope speech class. 2) Data augmentation techniques like contextual and back-translation word augmentation can generate more data for the minority hope speech class and reduce the imbalance.3) Removing overlapping words between hope and non-hope classes as a preprocessing step can reduce bias and improve model generalization.So in summary, the central research question is about improving M-BERT's performance on hope speech detection by specifically targeting data imbalance via focal loss, augmentation, and preprocessing. The paper hypothesizes and tests the effectiveness of these different techniques.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in hope speech detection:- It focuses on addressing the issue of data imbalance, which is often overlooked in other works. Many papers apply BERT models directly without considering the skewed distribution of hope vs non-hope examples. This paper examines the impact of imbalance and proposes techniques like focal loss, data augmentation, and word removal to mitigate it.- Most other works report only weighted average F1, while this paper emphasizes macro average F1 as a more suitable metric for imbalanced data. Reporting both provides a more comprehensive view of model performance.- The use of focal loss and backtranslation data augmentation have been explored before in other NLP tasks, but the application to hope speech is novel. The word removal algorithm as a preprocessing step is also unique.- The paper provides a strong empirical analysis of each technique - focal loss, augmentation, word removal. Many details on the advantages, limitations, and error analysis for each method are presented. This level of thorough experimentation is rare in existing works.- State-of-the-art comparisons show the word removal preprocessing gives substantially better macro F1 than previous benchmarks. This highlights the importance of properly addressing data imbalance.Overall, the rigorous examination of imbalance, extensive empirical analysis, and performance improvements demonstrate this paper's significant contributions over prior art in hope speech detection. The techniques and insights presented here could benefit other researchers tackling similar issues.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest the following future research directions:- Conducting an ablation study on the effect of features from one or more layers of M-BERT. They mention wanting to explore this to better understand how the different layers contribute to the model performance.- Further analyzing the convergence issues of focal loss and its relative contribution to errors in hope speech detection. They suggest this could provide more insight into the limitations of focal loss.- Studying the impact of the number of words augmented in contextual data augmentation. This could help optimize the augmentation strategy. - Examining the relationship between the intermediary language used for back translation and performance. They suggest this could reveal which languages are most useful as intermediaries.- Evaluating the effect of word removal on context. They propose this could reveal how much context is needed for the model to perform well after word removal.- Verifying the effectiveness of the suggested strategies on additional languages and code-mixed data. This would test the generalization of their methods.- Clarifying areas where conclusions are unclear, such as why the loss function has no impact when using word removal.In summary, the main future directions are focused on better understanding the limitations of their methods, optimizing the hyperparameters and settings, and testing the generalization to other datasets. The authors aim to gain additional insights that can further improve performance on hope speech detection.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes several strategies to address the inherent data imbalance issue in hope speech detection. First, it introduces focal loss to reshape the standard cross-entropy loss by penalizing errors for well-classified instances. Second, it employs contextual and back-translation based data augmentation techniques to generate more samples for the underrepresented hope class. Third, it develops a word removal pre-processing algorithm to eliminate overlapping words between hope and non-hope classes that can bias the model. The authors experiment with these techniques using Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) on the Hope Speech Detection dataset, evaluating performance improvements on the macro F1 metric. The main findings are that focal loss, data augmentation, and word removal preprocessing can individually improve macro F1 by 0.11, 0.10, and 0.28 points respectively over the M-BERT baseline when addressing class imbalance.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

Based on my reading, the key problems/questions addressed in this paper are:1. The issue of inherent data imbalance in hope speech detection datasets, which can negatively impact model performance. Most prior work has not explicitly accounted for this. 2. The problem of significant word overlap between hope and non-hope speech comments, which can overestimate model performance and cause bias. This issue is also amplified by the class imbalance.3. The lack of focus on preprocessing techniques in prior hope speech detection research and their potential benefits.4. The suitability of using weighted average F1 score as the evaluation metric given the practical application and class imbalance. 5. How to best optimize Multilingual BERT (M-BERT) for hope speech detection under real-world conditions of data imbalance and word overlap.The authors investigate mitigation strategies like focal loss, data augmentation, and word removal preprocessing to deal with these issues and improve M-BERT's ability to identify minority hope speech comments. Their experiments aim to quantify the impact of each technique.
