# [FSC: Few-point Shape Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07359)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Previous point cloud completion methods require thousands of input points and fail when only tens of points are available. However, the paper shows via entropy analysis that even 64 points retain nearly 50% of the shape information, indicating feasibility of completion from very sparse inputs. The key challenges are the lack of both local details and global shape information with so few input points.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes the Few-point Shape Completion (FSC) model to address few-point cloud completion. The key ideas are:

1) A dual-branch encoder to extract both extensive features utilizing all points equally and salient features highlighting more useful points. This balances comprehensive point usage and selective point importance.

2) A two-stage revision module that uses WGANs to bring the latent shape features and output point clouds closer to real point cloud data. This enhances detail and authenticity. 

3) Point feature fusion in the decoder using PointNet++ and attention to incorporate both local and global information for better detail generation.

Main Contributions:

1) First investigation of few-point cloud completion feasibility and performance analysis showing possibility from as few as 64 points.

2) Novel FSC model with specialized designs for few-point completion including the dual-branch encoder, two-stage revising GAN, and point feature fusion decoder.

3) State-of-the-art performance on few-point completion, outperforming previous approaches on ShapeNet and KITTI datasets for inputs with varying sparsity. Good generalization to unseen categories and robustness against point density variations.
