# [From Static to Dynamic: Adapting Landmark-Aware Image Models for Facial   Expression Recognition in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05447)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) in unconstrained videos is challenging due to insufficient training data, limited diversity in poses/occlusions/illuminations, inherent ambiguity in facial expressions, and lack of modeling of temporal dynamics. In contrast, static facial expression recognition (SFER) has abundant data and strong performance. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Static-to-Dynamic (S2D) model that efficiently adapts a pre-trained landmark-aware image model for SFER to handle DFER in videos. S2D incorporates two key components:

1) Multi-View Complementary Prompters (MCPs): Enhances image-level features by fusing the pre-trained SFER features with facial landmark-aware features that focus on emotion-related regions. The landmark features also implicitly encode facial dynamics.

2) Temporal-Modeling Adapters (TMAs): Efficiently captures temporal dynamics and facial expression changes over time to expand the static model for videos. TMA adapts only a small fraction (<10%) of parameters.

An auxiliary Emotion-Anchors based Self-Distillation Loss is also introduced to provide reliable supervision for dealing with label ambiguity.

Main Contributions:

- Enhances image-level facial expression features by selection of robust SFER data and incorporation of landmark-aware features using MCPs

- Expands static model efficiently using lightweight TMAs to capture temporal dynamics, with only 9M extra trainable parameters  

- Achieves new state-of-the-art on multiple DFER benchmarks (DFEW, FERV39K, MAFW)

- Provides a simple, efficient and strong baseline for DFER through effective transfer learning, requiring only a fraction of parameters to be tuned

The proposed S2D framework effectively addresses key challenges in DFER by harnessing prior SFER knowledge and modeling dynamics, demonstrating the viability of adapting image models for in-the-wild video facial expression recognition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a simple yet powerful framework called S2D that efficiently adapts a facial landmark-aware image model pre-trained on static facial expression data to effectively recognize facial expressions in videos by incorporating Multi-View Complementary Prompters and Temporal-Modeling Adapters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Image-level representation enhancement: The paper introduces facial landmark-aware features as an auxiliary view to guide the model to focus more on emotion-related facial areas. It also utilizes static features learned from a large-scale SFER dataset (AffectNet) as prior knowledge to enhance image-level representations for both SFER and DFER tasks. 

2) Efficiently expanding the static FER model to the dynamic FER model: The paper proposes a Temporal-Modeling Adapter (TMA) module to efficiently capture temporal information and expand the capabilities of a pre-trained static FER model to the dynamic video setting with minimal additional trainable parameters (<10% of whole model).

3) Emotion-Anchors based Self-Distillation Loss: This loss provides more reliable soft labels using a set of reference samples (emotion anchors) to prevent performance deterioration due to ambiguous emotion labels in the training data.

In summary, the main contribution is an efficient and effective framework to transfer knowledge from static facial expression recognition to dynamic facial expression recognition in videos, achieving new state-of-the-art results on DFER benchmarks. The method enhances representations at both the image and sequence levels while keeping high parameter efficiency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) - The task of recognizing facial expressions from video clips rather than static images. This is more challenging than static facial expression recognition (SFER).

- Parameter-efficient transfer learning - Transferring a model trained on one task (e.g. SFER) to another related task (e.g. DFER) without substantially increasing the number of trainable parameters. This makes the process more efficient. 

- Multi-View Complementary Prompter (MCP) - A module proposed in this paper to fuse the static facial features and facial landmark features to enhance image-level representations.

- Temporal-Modeling Adapter (TMA) - A module proposed in this paper to capture the temporal dynamics and relationships between video frames for DFER.

- Emotion-Anchors based Self-Distillation Loss (SDL) - A loss function proposed in this paper to provide more reliable/less ambiguous labels using emotion-anchor reference samples, preventing deteriorated performance.

- Facial landmarks - Key facial points detected by off-the-shelf tools that provide useful features sensitive to facial expression changes.

- Transfer learning - Leveraging knowledge learned from large-scale static image datasets to improve video-based DFER with limited data.

The key ideas are using efficient transfer learning to adapt a static facial expression recognition model to the dynamic video setting using adapters and facial landmarks while preventing performance deterioration.
