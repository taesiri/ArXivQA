# [Longitudinal Counterfactuals: Constraints and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00105)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Counterfactual explanations are often proposed as a way to provide recourse to individuals regarding algorithmic decisions. However, current methods often generate counterfactuals that are implausible or unachievable for a given individual. This makes justifying their use for recourse difficult.
- While plausibility is agreed to be an important quality for counterfactuals aimed at providing recourse, quantifying ground truth plausibility continues to be challenging. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes using longitudinal data as a way to assess and improve the plausibility of counterfactual explanations. 
- They introduce a longitudinal distance metric that compares the difference between an individual's current state and their counterfactual state to differences seen in the longitudinal data. This allows them to quantify how similar a counterfactual change is to changes that have been previously observed.
- This metric can then be used to re-score/rank existing counterfactuals by plausibility. It can also be incorporated into the counterfactual generation process itself as an additional optimization constraint.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualizing counterfactuals as potential future states and using longitudinal data as a proxy for plausibility 
- Introduction of a longitudinal distance metric to compare counterfactual changes to observed historical changes
- Demonstration that the metric can effectively discriminate between more and less plausible counterfactuals
- Finding that requiring plausibility significantly reduces the proportion of individuals for which valid counterfactuals can be generated
- Discussion of inherent difficulties of providing true recourse through counterfactuals alone due to constraints on achievability
