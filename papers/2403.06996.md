# [On the stochastics of human and artificial creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06996)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
There is ongoing debate about whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems will achieve human-level general intelligence (AGI) soon. However, this debate lacks consensus on criteria to evaluate AGI. The paper argues that creativity is an integral component of human intelligence, so achieving AGI requires attaining human-level creativity or artificial creativity (AC). There is confusion regarding the extent to which AI like generative models are truly "creative," partly due to differing semantics. Thus the paper aims to establish a precise definition of creativity to effectively compare human and AI creativity.

Solution:
The paper first constructs an understanding of human creativity, drawing from philosophy, psychology, biology and neuroscience. It describes creativity heuristically as a two-phase stochastic Bayesian process: 

1) A "divergent thinking" phase of open, random exploration to generate novel idea candidates. This phase is characterized as a stochastic associative process akin to a Markov chain.

2) An evaluation phase to assess the usefulness or "purpose" of an idea within a conceptual framework or bias structure. Biases are critical for constraining the randomness and guiding creative exploration. 

True creativity involves dynamically restructuring biases to permit and judge novelty. This links creativity to the ability to adapt through transforming internal models of reality. 

After establishing this creativity framework, the paper uses it to evaluate the creativity of modern AI systems like large language models, image diffusion models, AlphaZero and more. It concludes these algorithms can generate novelty but lack autonomous evaluation and bias transformation capacities characteristic of human creativity. Hybrid systems incorporating predictive coding mechanisms are highlighted as a potential path towards artificial general intelligence with human-level creativity.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualizes human creativity through a statistical Bayesian lens as a stochastic, associative generative process directed by flexible biases 

- Emphasizes biases' critical and multifaceted role constraining divergence, enabling adaptation and assessing purpose 

- Identifies bias transformation as core to high-level creativity, relating it to adapting internal models of reality 

- Uses the developed creativity framework to argue modern AI still falls short of human creativity due to limitations in autonomous evaluation and bias restructuring

- Suggests predictive coding architectures as promising for progress towards artificial general intelligence exhibiting human-level creativity
