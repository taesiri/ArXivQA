# [On the stochastics of human and artificial creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06996)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
There is ongoing debate about whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems will achieve human-level general intelligence (AGI) soon. However, this debate lacks consensus on criteria to evaluate AGI. The paper argues that creativity is an integral component of human intelligence, so achieving AGI requires attaining human-level creativity or artificial creativity (AC). There is confusion regarding the extent to which AI like generative models are truly "creative," partly due to differing semantics. Thus the paper aims to establish a precise definition of creativity to effectively compare human and AI creativity.

Solution:
The paper first constructs an understanding of human creativity, drawing from philosophy, psychology, biology and neuroscience. It describes creativity heuristically as a two-phase stochastic Bayesian process: 

1) A "divergent thinking" phase of open, random exploration to generate novel idea candidates. This phase is characterized as a stochastic associative process akin to a Markov chain.

2) An evaluation phase to assess the usefulness or "purpose" of an idea within a conceptual framework or bias structure. Biases are critical for constraining the randomness and guiding creative exploration. 

True creativity involves dynamically restructuring biases to permit and judge novelty. This links creativity to the ability to adapt through transforming internal models of reality. 

After establishing this creativity framework, the paper uses it to evaluate the creativity of modern AI systems like large language models, image diffusion models, AlphaZero and more. It concludes these algorithms can generate novelty but lack autonomous evaluation and bias transformation capacities characteristic of human creativity. Hybrid systems incorporating predictive coding mechanisms are highlighted as a potential path towards artificial general intelligence with human-level creativity.

Main Contributions:
- Conceptualizes human creativity through a statistical Bayesian lens as a stochastic, associative generative process directed by flexible biases 

- Emphasizes biases' critical and multifaceted role constraining divergence, enabling adaptation and assessing purpose 

- Identifies bias transformation as core to high-level creativity, relating it to adapting internal models of reality 

- Uses the developed creativity framework to argue modern AI still falls short of human creativity due to limitations in autonomous evaluation and bias restructuring

- Suggests predictive coding architectures as promising for progress towards artificial general intelligence exhibiting human-level creativity


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper argues that while recent advances in AI like large language models and diffusion models can generate novel outputs, they currently lack the capability for flexible evaluation and transformation of biases that is integral to human-level creativity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the understanding of human creativity and the prospects for achieving human-level artificial creativity:

1. It provides a detailed conceptualization of human creativity from philosophical, statistical, neuroscientific, and invariance perspectives. In particular, it characterizes human creativity as a stochastic process involving both divergent, associative thinking and an evaluation mechanism guided by flexible cognitive biases. 

2. It argues that for artificial intelligence to achieve human-level, general intelligence (AGI), it must also attain human-level creativity. This requires not just generating novelty, but dynamically evaluating and transforming biases and reference frames to determine if the novelty "works" or is useful.

3. It evaluates the creativity of modern AI systems, including large language models, diffusion models for image generation, AlphaZero, and mathematical discovery systems. It concludes that while these systems can generate novelty by recombining training data, they lack the capability for autonomous evaluation and transformation of their own biases and world models that is central to human creativity.

4. It proposes that future progress towards artificial creativity may come from architectures incorporating both bottom-up and top-down pathways, aligned with predictive coding theory of mind, to allow flexible interaction between perception and internal world models. This could enable the kind of dynamical bias transformation exhibited in human creativity.

In summary, the paper argues that human-level artificial creativity requires more than just generating novelty - it requires flexible evaluation and updating of internal models and biases. By providing an in-depth analysis of human creativity, current AI limitations, and potential future directions, it makes an important conceptual contribution to the debate around artificial general intelligence.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper on artificial and human creativity include:

- Divergent thinking - Exploring many possible solutions in an unconstrained manner, associated with creativity and "thinking outside the box." The paper discusses the stochastic nature of human divergent thinking.

- Bias/priors - Our existing knowledge structures, beliefs, and assumptions that guide creative idea generation and evaluation. The paper argues that dynamically restructuring biases is key to human creativity. 

- Insight and fancy - Stages of the creative process outlined by David Bohm, encompassing both imaginative, unconventional idea generation and rational, focused deductive reasoning.

- Markov processes - Statistical models used to represent the random "walks" of associative human thought processes.

- Artificial creativity (AC) - Creativity exhibited by artificial intelligence systems, compared to human creativity.

- Large language models (LLMs) - AI algorithms that predict text, which can generate novel but uncontrolled/unevaluated outputs. 

- Diffusion models - Generative AI models that can create novel images, blending training data.

- Reinforcement learning - An AI technique allowing systems to learn based on environmental feedback.

- Bending, blending, breaking - Categories for types of creativity based on how existing structures are transformed.

So in summary, key ideas relate to comparing stochastic properties of human creativity (divergent thinking, dynamic biases) to generative AI techniques, arguing current systems lack adaptive evaluation and true understanding.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper draws parallels between human creativity and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Can you elaborate on the similarities and differences between these processes? How well does the MCMC framework capture key aspects of human divergent thinking?

2. The paper argues that biases play a crucial role in guiding and constraining the creative process. How might extremely rigid or narrow biases limit creativity? What mechanisms enable flexible switching between focused and diffuse cognitive states that seem important for creativity?  

3. The paper categorizes three main ways in which biases can be transformed in creative processes: bending, blending and breaking. Can you provide examples of each type from the realms of science, art, or technology? What might be some psychological or social barriers to "breaking" existing structures?

4. The paper discusses how unconscious, parallel manipulation of thoughts in the cerebellum may generate novel recombinations and insights that occasionally emerge into consciousness as "a-ha moments." What evidence exists regarding communication pathways and information flow between the cerebellum and cerebral cortices? How might these pathways enable creative blending processes?  

5. The paper argues that a state of conformal invariance (location, scale and rotation invariance) may characterize the unconscious mind during creative ideation. What is the evidence that the brain perceives patterns and structures in an invariant manner during creative cognition? Are fractal principles applicable?

6. The paper evaluates the creative capabilities of several AI systems, arguing they lack adequate evaluator mechanisms to determine if generative outputs are useful or meaningful. What developments are needed for AI to autonomously transform biases and evaluate creative artifacts on dimensions like beauty, causality or scientific validity?

7. How essential are interactive perception-action loops to enabling autonomous transformation of biases and world models? Can you outline a potential AI architecture centered on predictive coding principles that might support creativity?

8. The paper focuses on evaluating single AI systems. What challenges arise when considering whether an ensemble of communicating AI agents exhibits collective creativity surpassing human levels? What guidelines apply here?  

9. The paper adopts a stochastic perspective on modeling human creativity. What are limitations of this approach? What psychological, cultural or contextual factors relevant to human creativity fall outside the scope of the proposed framework? 

10. The paper argues that creativity inherently involves restructuring biases to perceive novelty and usefulness. Does this theory of creativity and the criteria proposed privilege certain notions of creativity rooted in Western thought? How might Eastern philosophical perspectives lead to different evaluations of artificial creativity?
