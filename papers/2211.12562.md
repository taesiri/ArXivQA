# [PermutoSDF: Fast Multi-View Reconstruction with Implicit Surfaces using   Permutohedral Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12562)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 From my reading, the main research contributions of this paper are:

1. A new framework for optimizing neural implicit surfaces using hash-based encoding. This allows representing scenes as SDF and color fields that can capture high-frequency geometric details. 

2. An extension of hash encoding to a permutohedral lattice, which scales linearly with input dimension compared to the exponential scaling of voxel grids. This enables faster optimization and inference, especially in higher dimensions like 4D.

3. A regularization scheme with curvature loss and color network regularization that recovers accurate and detailed geometry even for ambiguous cases like specular or textureless regions. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that combining the strengths of hash-based encoding and implicit surface representations can allow reconstructing high-quality geometry and appearance from only posed RGB images. The proposed permutohedral lattice and regularization techniques are key to achieving this effectively.

The experiments aim to validate that the proposed PermutoSDF approach can recover geometric detail at the level of pores and wrinkles while training quickly and supporting real-time rendering. Comparisons to other recent methods on datasets like DTU and Multiface demonstrate the improved accuracy and level of detail of the reconstructions.

So in summary, the main research contributions are in developing a novel hash-based implicit surface framework with regularization techniques that enables highly detailed reconstruction from only RGB supervision. The permutohedral lattice accelerates this further.
