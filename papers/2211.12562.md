# [PermutoSDF: Fast Multi-View Reconstruction with Implicit Surfaces using   Permutohedral Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12562)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 From my reading, the main research contributions of this paper are:

1. A new framework for optimizing neural implicit surfaces using hash-based encoding. This allows representing scenes as SDF and color fields that can capture high-frequency geometric details. 

2. An extension of hash encoding to a permutohedral lattice, which scales linearly with input dimension compared to the exponential scaling of voxel grids. This enables faster optimization and inference, especially in higher dimensions like 4D.

3. A regularization scheme with curvature loss and color network regularization that recovers accurate and detailed geometry even for ambiguous cases like specular or textureless regions. 

The central hypothesis seems to be that combining the strengths of hash-based encoding and implicit surface representations can allow reconstructing high-quality geometry and appearance from only posed RGB images. The proposed permutohedral lattice and regularization techniques are key to achieving this effectively.

The experiments aim to validate that the proposed PermutoSDF approach can recover geometric detail at the level of pores and wrinkles while training quickly and supporting real-time rendering. Comparisons to other recent methods on datasets like DTU and Multiface demonstrate the improved accuracy and level of detail of the reconstructions.

So in summary, the main research contributions are in developing a novel hash-based implicit surface framework with regularization techniques that enables highly detailed reconstruction from only RGB supervision. The permutohedral lattice accelerates this further.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel framework for optimizing neural implicit surfaces using hash-based encoding. This combines the benefits of hash-based methods like INGP for fast training/inference with implicit surface representations like SDFs for accurately reconstructing geometry.

- Introducing an extension of hash encoding to a permutohedral lattice which scales linearly with the input dimensions. This allows for faster optimization compared to voxel-based hashing, especially in higher dimensions like 4D.

- A regularization scheme that enables recovering accurate SDF geometry with high-frequency details at the level of pores and wrinkles. This is achieved through curvature regularization to get smooth surfaces and novel color network regularization for reconstructing detail. 

- Demonstrating high-quality geometry and appearance reconstruction from only posed RGB images on various datasets. The method can be trained in 30 minutes and renders novel views in real-time using sphere tracing.

- Releasing code to facilitate further research in combining hash-based encodings and implicit neural representations.

In summary, the key innovation is in effectively combining the benefits of two recent paradigms - hash-based encoding and implicit neural surfaces - to achieve highly detailed reconstructions that render in real-time. The proposed permutohedral lattice and regularization scheme address key issues in making this combination work well.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called PermutoSDF for multiview 3D reconstruction that combines hash-based feature encoding using permutohedral lattices with implicit surface representation as signed distance functions to efficiently recover high quality geometry and appearance from only RGB images.
