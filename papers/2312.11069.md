# [Patterns of Closeness and Abstractness in Colexifications: The Case of   Indigenous Languages in the Americas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11069)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Colexification refers to when multiple concepts are expressed by the same lexical form across languages. Some colexifications are more common cross-linguistically than others. 
- Prior work has investigated what patterns underlie which concepts are more likely to colexify, such as concepts that are more closely related or that require less cognitive effort to relate. 
- The problem of concreteness/abstractness of concepts has been studied across various fields. Concrete concepts can be perceived by the senses while abstract ones cannot.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:
- The authors hypothesize, counter to some prior work, that concepts which are more similar in their concreteness/abstractness levels are more likely to colexify across languages.
- They test this hypothesis using a database of colexifications across 1989 languages. Concreteness ratings are mapped to the colexified concepts.
- They construct colexification graphs where nodes are concepts, edges are colexifications, edge weights indicate number of languages, and nodes include concreteness ratings. 
- Statistical analyses reveal a significant negative correlation between number/frequency of colexifications and the concreteness distance between the concepts.
- This supports their hypothesis that concepts more similar in concreteness levels are more likely to colexify cross-linguistically.  
- Findings challenge some prior theories relating colexification to metaphoricity. The analyses leverage broader conceptual coverage across more languages.
- This research provides new insights into human conceptualization and could assist in predicting concept concreteness for multilingual NLP.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper hypothesizes and provides evidence that concepts with more similar levels of concreteness are more likely to be colexified (expressed by the same word form) across languages, challenging previous theories that more distant concepts in terms of concreteness are more likely to colexify.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The paper hypothesizes and provides evidence that concepts which are closer in concreteness/abstractness are more likely to colexify across languages. This challenges previous theories that concepts more dissimilar in concreteness are more likely to colexify. The authors verify their hypothesis by calculating the correlation between the number/patterns of colexifications and the concreteness distance between the colexified concepts using data from the Cross-Linguistic Colexification Database (CLICS) across 1989 languages. They find a statistically significant negative correlation, supporting their hypothesis that concepts closer in concreteness are more likely to colexify.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel hypothesis regarding concreteness and colexification patterns, along with the empirical analysis using a large multilingual database to verify this hypothesis. This sheds new light on how concreteness and abstractness relate to lexicalization patterns across languages.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with it include:

- Colexification - refers to linguistic phenomena where multiple concepts or meanings are expressed by the same lexical form, such as polysemy or homophony. This is a core concept examined in the paper.

- Semantic typology - the study of cross-lingual semantic categories and classifications. The paper situates itself within this field of study. 

- Concreteness ratings - numerical scores indicating how concrete or abstract a concept is. The paper utilizes concreteness ratings from Brysbaert et al. (2014) to analyze colexification patterns. 

- CLICS - The Database of Cross-Linguistic Colexifications, which contains data on colexification patterns across thousands of languages. It is a key data source used in the study.

- Conceptual closeness - The paper hypothesizes that concepts which are closer in terms of concreteness are more likely to colexify across languages. This is a central hypothesis tested. 

- Indigenous languages of the Americas - In addition to global patterns, the paper looks specifically at colexification in 170 indigenous American languages. 

- Metaphoricity - The paper challenges some previous findings related to metaphorical mappings and colexification patterns.

In summary, the key concepts have to do with analyzing lexical patterns, semantic categories, concreteness, and colexification relationships across the languages of the world and indigenous American languages specifically.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper hypothesizes that concepts closer in concreteness are more likely to colexify. What is the theoretical motivation behind this hypothesis and how does it differ from previous work?

2. The paper uses concreteness ratings from Brysbaert et al. (2014). What are some potential limitations or biases in using those ratings, especially when applying them to non-English languages? How could the analysis account for these limitations?  

3. The analysis relies on mapping concepts in CLICS to the Brysbaert concreteness ratings. What challenges might this mapping introduce and how could the methodology be refined to address them? For example, dealing with multiword expressions.

4. The paper calculates a simple absolute difference between concreteness ratings. Could more sophisticated metrics of semantic similarity be used instead? What are the tradeoffs?

5. Fig. 1 shows a colexification subgraph for the concept "sun". How was this subgraph constructed algorithmically? What choices and assumptions were made in defining the nodes and edges?

6. Table 1 shows statistical correlations between concreteness distance and colexification counts. What other statistical tests could be used to evaluate the hypothesis? What are the limitations of relying solely on correlation metrics?  

7. The analysis is performed both on all languages in CLICS and specifically on Indigenous American languages. What motivated this split? Does it reveal different patterns and why might that occur?

8. The paper claims the preliminary findings challenge previous theories on colexification and metaphoricity. What exactly is being challenged and why? What further analyses are needed to more directly evaluate those previous theories?

9. The paper states findings are consistent across English, global West languages, and Indigenous American languages. Does this consistency actually support or undermine the criticism of anglocentric bias in the concreteness ratings? Why?

10. The concluding section mentions using language weights between concepts to evaluate a stronger hypothesis. What exactly would this entail? What additional insights could weighted graphs provide beyond the current analysis?
