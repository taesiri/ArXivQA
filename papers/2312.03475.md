## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MoleculeJAE, a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular representation learning that jointly models 2D and 3D molecular structures by fitting the distribution of their augmented trajectories using a combination of reconstructive and contrastive losses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MoleculeJAE, a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular representation learning. Specifically:

1) It introduces a trajectory modeling approach that jointly captures both 2D (chemical bonds) and 3D (molecular conformations) information of molecules through diffusion-based data augmentation. 

2) It formulates a theoretical framework that decomposes the trajectory distribution modeling into two complementary tasks - a reconstructive task and a contrastive task. This allows MoleculeJAE to unify contrastive and generative learning objectives.

3) It incorporates graph neural networks into the model architecture as conditional guidance for the diffused molecules, making the framework more suitable for downstream tasks that utilize ground-truth molecular structures.

4) It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance of the learned representations on 15 out of 20 molecular property prediction benchmarks, outperforming competitive baselines. This verifies the effectiveness of modeling augmented trajectories and the multi-task learning objective.

In summary, the key innovation lies in the proposal of jointly modeling 2D and 3D molecular trajectories in a self-supervised manner, which yields an expressive molecular representation beneficial for various geometry-related downstream tasks.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes jointly modeling the 2D and 3D structure of molecules using diffusion models. What are the key advantages of using diffusion models compared to other generative models like VAEs or GANs? How does it help in capturing both topological and geometrical properties?

2. The paper introduces a trajectory view of diffusion models. Can you elaborate more on this perspective and how it helps connect data augmentation techniques with the forward process of diffusion? What new insights does this provide?

3. Contrastive learning and score matching are combined in an interesting way in this work. Can you explain the intuition behind this combination and why both terms are needed in the final objective function? 

4. The reconstructive and contrastive tasks try to capture marginal and joint distributions respectively. What is the significance of modeling joint distributions in this context? How does the contrastive loss term specifically achieve this?

5. The encoder-decoder architecture uses equivariant blocks to respect symmetries. Can you discuss the importance of symmetry in molecular representations and why the score networks need to output equivariant vector fields?

6. How does the encoder that takes in original ground-truth data help in reconstruction compared to vanilla diffusion models? What conditional guidance does it provide?

7. The method seems to work well across both continuous and discrete diffusion frameworks. What adaptations were made to handle discrete structural data like bonds?

8. The contrastive loss term is shown to be sensitive. What could be the reasons behind this? How can it be made more stable?

9. The method reaches state-of-the-art on many quantum property and molecular dynamics tasks. What specific advantages does the learned representation provide over previous pretraining techniques?

10. What are some limitations of the current framework and possible future extensions that can enhance flexibility in trajectory modeling or reduce computational requirements?
