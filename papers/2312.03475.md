# [Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding: Trajectory Pretraining with 2D and 3D   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03475)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding (MoleculeJAE), a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular representation learning that jointly captures both 2D topological and 3D conformational information. The key idea is to model the augmented trajectories of molecular structures using diffusion processes and fit their joint distribution in a trajectory contrastive manner. Specifically, MoleculeJAE constructs equivariant trajectories of molecular graphs consisting of node features, edges, and 3D coordinates. It then optimizes a multi-task objective composed of a reconstructive score matching loss to fit marginal distributions and a contrastive loss to align trajectory embeddings. The model architecture incorporates equivariant graph neural networks to encode ground-truth molecular structures and diffused counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of MoleculeJAE on 15 out of 20 quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics prediction tasks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the contrastive loss and reconstructed distribution modeling. The core novelty lies in the unification of generative and contrastive paradigms for self-supervised representation learning based on the trajectory view of diffusion models. In summary, MoleculeJAE proves the promise of joint 2D and 3D molecular trajectory modeling for capturing informative molecular representations to facilitate quantum chemistry applications.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes MoleculeJAE, a novel framework for molecular representation learning that jointly models 2D and 3D molecular structures in a trajectory-based self-supervised manner using diffusion models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing MoleculeJAE, a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular representation learning that jointly captures both 2D (chemical bond structure) and 3D (conformer structure) information. The key ideas are:

1) It constructs augmented trajectories of molecules by diffusing both their 2D and 3D structures, mimicking molecular dynamics. 

2) It proposes to learn the distribution of these augmented trajectories in a self-supervised manner. This involves two tasks - a reconstructive task to capture the data distribution, and a contrastive task to capture relationships between augmented data points.

3) The resulting model outperforms competitive baselines on downstream tasks involving prediction of quantum mechanics properties and molecular dynamics forces, demonstrating its ability to learn useful representations capturing geometry/conformation information.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a way to effectively pretrain on molecular trajectories spanning both 2D and 3D modalities, for learning molecular representations that can benefit various downstream tasks involving geometrical/conformational properties. The novelty lies in formulating this as a trajectory distribution learning problem based on diffusions.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding (MoleculeJAE): The name of the proposed pretraining method that jointly models 2D and 3D molecular structures.

- Trajectory learning: A core idea in the paper is modeling the augmented trajectories of molecular structures using diffusion models. The method fits the joint distribution of these trajectories.  

- Reconstructive and contrastive tasks: Two main tasks derived in the paper to capture marginal and joint trajectory distribution information respectively. The final loss combines these two.

- 2D topology and 3D geometry: The paper models both the 2D bond connectivity graphs and 3D molecular conformations. The goal is a joint representation.

- Self-supervised pretraining: The overall pretraining approach is unsupervised, using the trajectory modeling as a supervisory signal.

- Diffusion models: Used to generate augmented molecular trajectories for pretraining. Both continuous and discrete variants are discussed.

- Equivariance: Symmetry principles like SE(3) equivariance are used in the model architecture design to respect invariances. 

- Downstream tasks: Various quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics prediction tasks are used to evaluate the learned representations.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with joint 2D and 3D pretraining, trajectory modeling, reconstructive and contrastive objectives, and leveraging equivariance and symmetries.
