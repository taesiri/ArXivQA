# [Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding: Trajectory Pretraining with 2D and 3D   Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03475)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding (MoleculeJAE), a novel self-supervised learning framework for molecular representation learning that jointly captures both 2D topological and 3D conformational information. The key idea is to model the augmented trajectories of molecular structures using diffusion processes and fit their joint distribution in a trajectory contrastive manner. Specifically, MoleculeJAE constructs equivariant trajectories of molecular graphs consisting of node features, edges, and 3D coordinates. It then optimizes a multi-task objective composed of a reconstructive score matching loss to fit marginal distributions and a contrastive loss to align trajectory embeddings. The model architecture incorporates equivariant graph neural networks to encode ground-truth molecular structures and diffused counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of MoleculeJAE on 15 out of 20 quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics prediction tasks. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of the contrastive loss and reconstructed distribution modeling. The core novelty lies in the unification of generative and contrastive paradigms for self-supervised representation learning based on the trajectory view of diffusion models. In summary, MoleculeJAE proves the promise of joint 2D and 3D molecular trajectory modeling for capturing informative molecular representations to facilitate quantum chemistry applications.
