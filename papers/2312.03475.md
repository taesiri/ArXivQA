## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Learning effective molecular representations that capture both 2D chemical structures and 3D geometries is important for drug discovery but remains challenging. 
- Existing methods have limitations in jointly modeling the distribution of 2D and 3D molecular data in a way that respects symmetries and non-equilibrium dynamics. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding (MoleculeJAE), a self-supervised framework for learning molecular representations by fitting joint distributions of augmented 2D and 3D molecular trajectories.
- It constructs equivariant molecular trajectories using diffusion processes and models them using a multi-task objective combining reconstruction and contrastive learning. 
- An equivariant graph neural network encodes ground-truth molecular structures to guide the trajectory fitting of the diffused structures.
- The framework unifies generative and contrastive learning, providing a versatile representation applicable to various downstream tasks.

Key Contributions:
- Novel trajectory-based self-supervised learning approach for molecules using diffusion and auto-encoding.
- Jointly models 2D and 3D molecular structures in an equivariant manner.
- Combines strengths of contrastive and generative learning through multi-task objective.
- State-of-the-art performance on 15 out of 20 molecular prediction tasks against competitive baselines.
- Empirically demonstrates effectiveness of modeling joint distributions of molecular trajectories.
- Provides insights into utilizing symmetries and non-equilibrium dynamics for molecular representation learning.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative trajectory-based self-supervised learning framework for molecular representation learning that jointly captures 2D and 3D structures. By modeling augmented molecular trajectories using diffusion processes and a multi-task objective, it provides an effective and versatile molecular representation for downstream applications.
