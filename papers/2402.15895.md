# [Multi-Object Tracking by Hierarchical Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15895)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In multi-object tracking, it is crucial to build discriminative visual representations of objects to avoid identity mismatches between targets. 
- Commonly used bounding box features are noisy and not discriminative enough.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a visual hierarchy with three levels - compositional, semantic, contextual:
    - Compositional: Features from salient object parts
    - Semantic: Features from bounding box 
    - Contextual: Features contrasting object to its surrounding context
- Propose CSC-Attention module to fuse features from the three levels
   - Attend to discriminative object parts by contrasting with background context
- Build tracker named CSC-Tracker using above innovations 

Main Contributions:

1. Propose visual hierarchy to build more discriminative representations without needing extra annotations

2. Propose CSC-Attention to effectively fuse features from visual hierarchy 

3. Build CSC-Tracker using above two innovations 
   - Achieves state-of-art accuracy among transformer trackers
   - More robust to detection noise
   - High time efficiency

In summary, the paper proposes a new visual representation paradigm using a compositional-semantic-contextual hierarchy that is more discriminative for multi-object tracking. An attention module called CSC-Attention is used to fuse features from this hierarchy. A tracker CSC-Tracker is built using these innovations, demonstrating improved accuracy, robustness and efficiency over prior arts.
