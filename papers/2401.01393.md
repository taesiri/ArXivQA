# [Backtracking New Q-Newton's method, Newton's flow, Voronoi's diagram and   Stochastic root finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01393)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- The paper explores methods for finding roots of polynomials and meromorphic functions, comparing Newton's method and its variants to a recently proposed method called Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN). 

- Experiments showed BNQN produces smoother "basins of attraction" pictures compared to Newton's method when finding roots. The pictures resemble Voronoi diagrams and pictures from Newton's flow methods. The goal is to understand if there are rigorous mathematical connections.

Proposed Solution
- The paper conducts extensive experiments applying Newton's method, Random Relaxed Newton, Newton's method for optimization, three Newton's flow methods, and BNQN to find roots of various polynomial and transcendental test functions.

- Pictures of the basins of attraction are generated for visual comparison against Voronoi diagrams of the root sets. Stochastic root finding is also examined.

Key Results
- Newton's flow for the function f/f' and BNQN produce pictures most resembling Voronoi diagrams. Pictures get less clear when roots are inside the convex hull of other roots.

- Newton's method does not reflect root geometry well. Its flow version is better but still imperfect. Random Relaxed Newton distorts pictures further.

- BNQN is more robust against perturbations than other methods.

Main Contributions
- Establishes strong experimental evidence linking BNQN and certain Newton's flow methods to Voronoi diagrams of root sets through basins of attraction pictures.

- Identifies BNQN as superior for smooth basins and stochastic settings vs. classical methods.

- Posits open theoretical questions on precise mathematical relations between the methods behind the observed connections.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper experimentally explores connections between a new root-finding algorithm called Backtracking New Q-Newton's method, Newton's flow, Voronoi diagrams, and stochastic root-finding, finding that Backtracking New Q-Newton's method produces smoother and more accurate basins of attraction that better match Voronoi diagrams compared to other methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper experimentally explores the connections between the Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN), Newton's flow, and Voronoi diagrams when finding roots of polynomials and other functions. Some key contributions are:

1) Shows experimentally that BNQN produces smoother and less fractal basins of attraction that better match Voronoi diagrams of the roots compared to classical Newton's method.

2) Finds that Newton's flow for the function f/f' also closely matches Voronoi diagrams, while Newton's flow for f itself does not. 

3) Highlights an interesting phenomenon where methods that involve second derivatives (BNQN and Newton's flow for f/f') seem to produce diagrams closer to Voronoi, suggesting an open question about the precise reason for this.

4) Tests the robustness of different root-finding methods on stochastic variants of test functions, finding BNQN to be most robust among the methods explored.

5) Poses several open challenges and future research directions based on the experiments, such as using different metrics for Voronoi diagrams and exploring basin structures for multiple roots.

In summary, the main contribution is an in-depth experimental exploration to reveal and qualify connections between optimization-based root-finding, vector field flows, and Voronoi diagrams, highlighting BNQN as a method that bridges discrete and continuous dynamics.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN): A new variant of Newton's method for optimization problems that has strong theoretical guarantees and good practical performance.

- Newton's method: A well-known numerical method for finding roots of equations or optimizing functions. The paper compares BNQN to standard Newton's method and some variants.

- Basins of attraction: The sets of initial points that iterate to the same root when applying an iterative root-finding method. The paper examines and compares the smoothness and geometries of the basins of attraction for different methods.

- Newton's flow: A continuous dynamical system related to Newton's method. The basins of attraction for BNQN are compared to different formulations of Newton's flow. 

- Voronoi diagrams: A partition of space based on distances to a set of points. The basins of attraction for some methods resemble Voronoi diagrams associated to the roots.

- Stochastic root finding: Finding roots of functions with random noise or perturbations added. BNQN appears more robust to noise than other methods explored.

- Meromorphic functions: Complex functions allowing poles. Many experiments in the paper involve finding roots of meromorphic functions.

So in summary, key terms revolve around variants of Newton's method, basins of attraction, connections to flows and Voronoi diagrams, and robustness for stochastic problems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the Backtracking New Q-Newton's method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the perturbation of the Hessian matrix in the New Q-Newton and Backtracking New Q-Newton methods help avoid saddle points and convergence to undesirable critical points? What is the intuition behind this perturbation?

2. Explain the rationale behind using the spectral radius instead of the minimum eigenvalue in choosing the perturbation parameter delta in BNQN. How does this lead to better convergence properties? 

3. The Armijo backtracking line search is incorporated into BNQN to ensure global convergence. What specifically does the backtracking process achieve and how does it enable global convergence guarantees?

4. Theorem 1 states strong convergence guarantees for BNQN when applied to finding roots of meromorphic functions. Outline the key ideas in the proof of this result. What conditions need to be satisfied?

5. This paper hypothesizes interesting connections between BNQN and concepts like Newton's flow and Voronoi diagrams. Elaborate further on these potential links and why they may not just be coincidences.  

6. How exactly does the basin of attraction for BNQN differ from standard Newton's method? What causes it to appear smoother and less fractal-like in structure?

7. Explain the differences in performance between the optimization version of Newton's method versus BNQN. Why does Newton's method for optimization struggle in many test cases?

8. Analyze the relative robustness of BNQN versus other methods like standard Newton and random relaxed Newton when noise or random perturbations are introduced. Why might BNQN perform better?

9. Discuss some of the open questions and future research directions mentioned at the end of the paper. Which of these seem most intriguing or promising to you?

10. How might the ideas explored in this paper regarding convergence properties and basin structure extend to finding roots of multivariate systems instead of just univariate functions?
