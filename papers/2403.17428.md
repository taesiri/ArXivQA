# [Aligning Large Language Models for Enhancing Psychiatric Interviews   through Symptom Delineation and Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17428)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is growing demand for mental health services globally, but barriers exist in accessibility and engagement. Digital healthcare and AI could help improve clinical workflow efficiency to address this gap.
- Psychiatric interviews are structured dialogues between professionals and patients. Applying large language models (LLMs) to enhance such interviews by aiding documentation and information synthesis is an underexplored area. 

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors investigate using LLMs to enhance psychiatric interviews with North Korean refugee patients experiencing trauma/PTSD, via two capabilities:
   1) Delineating symptom-indicative sections of dialogues and naming the symptoms
   2) Summarizing patient stressors and symptoms from the interview dialogues
- Labeled interview transcripts are used to train the LLM models and evaluate their performance on these tasks.

Methods:
- Dataset: 
   ~10 lengthy interview transcripts with North Korean defectors labeled by mental health experts for stressors, symptoms, symptom-indicative sections.
- Models Tested:
   GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo 
- Experiments:
   - Symptom delineation tested via zero-shot inference, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning. 
   - Interview summarization tested via zero-shot prompted inference.
   - Metrics: Accuracy, precision/recall, BERTscore, G-Eval similarity to human summaries

Results:
- LLMs can effectively delineate symptom-indicative sections in 70% of tested segments
- Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 has high multi-label classification accuracy for naming symptoms
- Summarization has high G-Eval score and similarity to human expert summaries

Contributions:
- Novel expert-labeled interview dataset for LLM evaluation
- Demonstrates LLMs can be effectively aligned for psychiatric interview enhancement
- Provides baseline LLM experiments, analysis and prompting strategies for this application area

The paper makes a case for the potential of LLMs to aid clinical psychiatry workflows by information extraction and summarization of patient verbal accounts. Further real-world testing would be valuable to translate these capabilities into practice.
