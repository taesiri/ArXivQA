# [Unaligned 2D to 3D Translation with Conditional Vector-Quantized Code   Diffusion using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14152)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to perform high-quality 2D to 3D image translation for complex volumetric data exhibiting varying internal and external topologies, from different domains, in a unified framework. Specifically, the paper investigates translating between 2D views (e.g. X-rays) to 3D volumes (e.g. CT scans) where there are differences in imaging devices, modalities, and geometric misalignment between the 2D and 3D data. The key hypothesis is that modeling this as a conditional generative modeling problem with a likelihood-based model in a discrete latent space parameterized by transformers can achieve high quality 3D image synthesis without requiring aligned training data.In summary, the main research question is how to perform unaligned 2D to 3D translation with a conditional generative model to generate complex 3D data from 2D views of different domains. The key hypothesis is that a conditional discrete diffusion model parameterized by transformers in a compressed latent space can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:- Proposing a novel 2D to 3D image translation approach using conditional diffusion with transformers. The key idea is to first compress the 2D and 3D data into discrete vector quantized (VQ) spaces independently using VQ-VAEs. Then a diffusion model parameterized by a transformer is used to generate the 3D data conditioned on the 2D data in the compressed VQ space.- Showing that operating in the discrete VQ space allows the model to scale easily to high-resolution 3D data. The global context provided by the transformer's attention mechanism also allows using unaligned 2D and 3D data, since any part of the 2D inputs can contribute to 3D voxel predictions.- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on two complex volumetric image datasets (chest CT scans and baggage screening CTs) compared to GAN and NeRF baselines. The model gives higher fidelity in terms of density and coverage metrics, while also providing likelihood estimates.In summary, the key contribution is a new conditional discrete diffusion approach for 2D to 3D translation that works directly in an information-rich VQ space and does not require aligned 2D-3D data pairs. This allows generating high quality 3D volumes conditioned on 2D views in a simple and scalable way.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new approach for generating 3D images from 2D views by modeling the conditional probability distribution between them using discrete vector quantized representations and a transformer-parameterized diffusion model that allows unaligned inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in 2D to 3D image translation:- The paper proposes a novel two-stage approach using vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) and discrete diffusion models parameterized by transformers. This is a unique combination not explored in other work.- Most prior work relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Examples are X2CT-GAN and CCX-rayNet which the paper compares against. The use of transformers and discrete diffusion sets this work apart.- A key advantage claimed is the ability to handle unaligned 2D and 3D data, whereas CNN/GAN approaches like X2CT-GAN require careful alignment between modalities. The information-rich VQ latent spaces and full-coverage transformer attention enable this.- While some recent works use transformers for 3D tasks, they report issues with efficiency and sensitivity to domain shifts that this paper aims to address.- The method models distributions in latent space rather than pixels directly. This provides benefits like domain invariance and likelihood estimation that GAN-based approaches lack.- Overall, the approach seems quite unique in its specific combination of techniques and goals of handling unaligned data. The comparisons on two complex medical/security datasets indicate state-of-the-art performance over existing specialized 2D-3D translation methods on various metrics.In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach and architecture using modern techniques like transformers and discrete representations. It demonstrates advantages over existing CNN/GAN methods, especially for unaligned real-world 2D-3D translation tasks. The results appear promising but further analysis on more diverse datasets would be useful.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:- Scaling their approach with larger models trained on more diverse datasets. They propose exploring how well their method generalizes when trained on larger datasets with more variability.- Providing an in-depth study on hallucinated model outputs. The authors note that generative models may produce some outputs that are unrealistic or "hallucinated". They suggest further analysis on this aspect to better understand it.- Evaluating how well the approach can generalize between very different imaging modalities. The authors suggest testing their method on translating between modalities that are more distinct, beyond just X-rays and CT scans.- Exploring different model variations and architectures. The authors propose trying different compression network designs, transformer architectures, etc. to potentially further improve performance.- Incorporating human evaluation/verification. The authors suggest having human operators verify model outputs in real-world deployment scenarios, rather than solely relying on metrics.- Allowing more control over the generative process. The authors note trade-offs between compression rates, sample quality, and reconstruction quality that could be further studied.- Comparing to a wider range of state-of-the-art methods. The authors suggest comparing against an expanded set of recent approaches.So in summary, the main directions seem to be exploring the method on larger-scale and more diverse data, more thorough evaluation especially with human verification, testing on more distinct modalities, comparing to more methods, and further analysis of the model outputs and generative process.
