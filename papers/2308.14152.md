# [Unaligned 2D to 3D Translation with Conditional Vector-Quantized Code   Diffusion using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14152)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to perform high-quality 2D to 3D image translation for complex volumetric data exhibiting varying internal and external topologies, from different domains, in a unified framework. 

Specifically, the paper investigates translating between 2D views (e.g. X-rays) to 3D volumes (e.g. CT scans) where there are differences in imaging devices, modalities, and geometric misalignment between the 2D and 3D data. The key hypothesis is that modeling this as a conditional generative modeling problem with a likelihood-based model in a discrete latent space parameterized by transformers can achieve high quality 3D image synthesis without requiring aligned training data.

In summary, the main research question is how to perform unaligned 2D to 3D translation with a conditional generative model to generate complex 3D data from 2D views of different domains. The key hypothesis is that a conditional discrete diffusion model parameterized by transformers in a compressed latent space can achieve this effectively.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing a novel 2D to 3D image translation approach using conditional diffusion with transformers. The key idea is to first compress the 2D and 3D data into discrete vector quantized (VQ) spaces independently using VQ-VAEs. Then a diffusion model parameterized by a transformer is used to generate the 3D data conditioned on the 2D data in the compressed VQ space.

- Showing that operating in the discrete VQ space allows the model to scale easily to high-resolution 3D data. The global context provided by the transformer's attention mechanism also allows using unaligned 2D and 3D data, since any part of the 2D inputs can contribute to 3D voxel predictions.

- Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on two complex volumetric image datasets (chest CT scans and baggage screening CTs) compared to GAN and NeRF baselines. The model gives higher fidelity in terms of density and coverage metrics, while also providing likelihood estimates.

In summary, the key contribution is a new conditional discrete diffusion approach for 2D to 3D translation that works directly in an information-rich VQ space and does not require aligned 2D-3D data pairs. This allows generating high quality 3D volumes conditioned on 2D views in a simple and scalable way.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for generating 3D images from 2D views by modeling the conditional probability distribution between them using discrete vector quantized representations and a transformer-parameterized diffusion model that allows unaligned inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in 2D to 3D image translation:

- The paper proposes a novel two-stage approach using vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) and discrete diffusion models parameterized by transformers. This is a unique combination not explored in other work.

- Most prior work relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Examples are X2CT-GAN and CCX-rayNet which the paper compares against. The use of transformers and discrete diffusion sets this work apart.

- A key advantage claimed is the ability to handle unaligned 2D and 3D data, whereas CNN/GAN approaches like X2CT-GAN require careful alignment between modalities. The information-rich VQ latent spaces and full-coverage transformer attention enable this.

- While some recent works use transformers for 3D tasks, they report issues with efficiency and sensitivity to domain shifts that this paper aims to address.

- The method models distributions in latent space rather than pixels directly. This provides benefits like domain invariance and likelihood estimation that GAN-based approaches lack.

- Overall, the approach seems quite unique in its specific combination of techniques and goals of handling unaligned data. The comparisons on two complex medical/security datasets indicate state-of-the-art performance over existing specialized 2D-3D translation methods on various metrics.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach and architecture using modern techniques like transformers and discrete representations. It demonstrates advantages over existing CNN/GAN methods, especially for unaligned real-world 2D-3D translation tasks. The results appear promising but further analysis on more diverse datasets would be useful.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Scaling their approach with larger models trained on more diverse datasets. They propose exploring how well their method generalizes when trained on larger datasets with more variability.

- Providing an in-depth study on hallucinated model outputs. The authors note that generative models may produce some outputs that are unrealistic or "hallucinated". They suggest further analysis on this aspect to better understand it.

- Evaluating how well the approach can generalize between very different imaging modalities. The authors suggest testing their method on translating between modalities that are more distinct, beyond just X-rays and CT scans.

- Exploring different model variations and architectures. The authors propose trying different compression network designs, transformer architectures, etc. to potentially further improve performance.

- Incorporating human evaluation/verification. The authors suggest having human operators verify model outputs in real-world deployment scenarios, rather than solely relying on metrics.

- Allowing more control over the generative process. The authors note trade-offs between compression rates, sample quality, and reconstruction quality that could be further studied.

- Comparing to a wider range of state-of-the-art methods. The authors suggest comparing against an expanded set of recent approaches.

So in summary, the main directions seem to be exploring the method on larger-scale and more diverse data, more thorough evaluation especially with human verification, testing on more distinct modalities, comparing to more methods, and further analysis of the model outputs and generative process.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for generating 3D CT-like images from 2D X-ray views. The key idea is to use a discrete diffusion model conditioned on vector quantized (VQ) latent representations to translate between the 2D and 3D domains. First, VQ autoencoders compress the high-dimensional 2D and 3D data into compact discrete codes. Then, a transformer models the conditional probability of generating the 3D codes given the 2D codes, allowing full-coverage attention over the complete 2D codebook. This avoids issues with geometric and domain misalignment between modalities. Experiments on chest CT scans and baggage screening data show the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of density, coverage, and distortion metrics compared to GAN and NeRF baselines. The approach is simple, scalable, and provides likelihood estimates. Key advantages are the ability to handle unaligned data via discrete latent diffusion and leverage global context from multiple views through the transformer's full-coverage attention.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a summary of the paper in two paragraphs:

This paper proposes a novel approach for generating 3D images from 2D views using conditional diffusion models parameterized by transformers. The key idea is to learn compressed vector quantized (VQ) representations of the 2D and 3D data independently using VQ autoencoders. This allows modeling the conditional distribution between unaligned 2D and 3D data. Specifically, the 3D VQ codes are diffused by gradually masking them out over time. An unconstrained transformer is then trained to predict the original 3D codes from the masked codes, conditioned on the 2D VQ codebook. Operating in the compressed VQ space allows full-coverage attention over the 2D views for generating new 3D samples. 

The method is evaluated on volumetric medical images and baggage screening data. It demonstrates superior performance over GAN and neural radiance field baselines in terms of density, coverage, and distortion metrics. Key advantages of the approach include the ability to handle unaligned data, scale to high resolutions, and provide likelihood estimates. The use of diffusion in discrete code space enables efficient and high-quality 3D synthesis. Limitations include potential for hallucinated outputs and limited diversity compared to real data. Overall, this is a novel application of conditional diffusion models to unpaired cross-modality 2D-to-3D translation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach for 2D to 3D image translation using conditional diffusion with transformers. The key idea is to first compress the 2D and 3D images into discrete vector quantized (VQ) latent spaces using separate VQ-VAEs. This allows the model to operate in an information-rich discrete code space without requiring aligned datasets. The 3D codes are then generated conditional on the 2D codes using a discrete diffusion model parameterized by an unconstrained transformer. This allows full-coverage attention over the 2D codebooks, so any part of the 2D views can contribute to predicting the 3D voxels. The model is trained by masking the 3D codes and having the transformer try to reconstruct them based on the 2D codes. This approach enables high-quality 3D synthesis from unaligned 2D views by leveraging the compressed VQ space and bidirectional attention of the transformer.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and questions addressed in this paper are:

- The paper is tackling the task of synthesizing 3D images (e.g. CT scans) from 2D views (e.g. X-ray images). This is a challenging problem in computer vision as it requires generating accurate 3D representations from limited 2D input views.

- The paper aims to address the issues of complex shape topologies, differences across imaging domains (2D vs 3D), and geometric misalignment between the input 2D views and target 3D image. 

- Current methods rely on cycle consistency losses or optimizing 3D consistency from 2D views. But they have limitations in handling both domain gaps and geometric misalignments together.

- The paper proposes a novel approach using conditional diffusion with transformers to address both these issues. Their key questions are:

  1) How to learn compressed representations for 2D and 3D data that are invariant to domain gaps and misalignment?

  2) How to generate high quality 3D images conditioned on these compressed 2D representations?

- The main contributions aim to tackle these issues by:

  1) Learning separate compressed discrete representations for 2D and 3D data using VQ-VAEs.

  2) Modeling the conditional probability of 3D given 2D in this compressed space using transformers.

  3) Allowing unaligned inputs and full-coverage attention over 2D views for 3D synthesis.

In summary, the key problem is performing 2D to 3D translation robustly across domain gaps and geometric misalignment. The paper aims to address this using a simple but effective approach based on conditional diffusion with transformers in learned discrete latent spaces.
