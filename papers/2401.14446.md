# [Black-Box Access is Insufficient for Rigorous AI Audits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14446)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- External audits of AI systems are increasingly recognized as important for governance and oversight. However, their effectiveness depends critically on the degree of access granted to auditors. 
- Recent voluntary audits of advanced AI systems have relied primarily on black-box access, where auditors can only query the system and observe outputs. This severely limits auditors' ability to rigorously assess risks.
- White-box access to internal workings (weights, activations, gradients) and outside-the-box access to contextual information (methodology, data, findings from internal testing, etc.) facilitate much more scrutiny.

Proposed Solutions:
- This paper examines the limitations of black-box audits and shows how white-box methods like attacks, interpretability, and fine-tuning allow for more thorough evaluations. 
- It also discusses how outside-the-box access to code, data, documentation, hyperparameters, deployment details, and internal evaluation findings helps auditors conduct better-targeted, more efficient assessments.
- The paper then outlines technical, physical, and legal mechanisms to provide white- and outside-the-box access securely without compromising intellectual property.

Main Contributions:
- A taxonomy of black-, grey-, white- and outside-the-box access for auditors.
- An analysis of the inadequacy of black-box access and the advantages unlocked by white- and outside-the-box access.
- An overview of methods to safely grant auditors elevated access without risking model reconstruction or leaks.
- The conclusions that (1) transparency about access/methods is critical for interpreting audit results and (2) white-/outside-the-box access allows substantially more meaningful scrutiny.

In summary, this paper makes a strong case that more permissive access should be provided to auditors of advanced AI systems when greater rigor is desired, while outlining ways to do this securely. The analysis aims to inform emerging governance regimes that rely heavily on audits for oversight.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper argues that providing auditors with white-box access to AI systems' internal workings and outside-the-box access to contextual details about their development allows for substantially more meaningful and rigorous evaluation compared to relying solely on black-box input-output analysis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It presents shortcomings of black-box methods for evaluating AI systems, including their inability to develop a generalizable understanding of the system, study components separately, potential to produce misleading results, and limitations for explaining specific decisions.

2. It overviews the advantages of white-box methods involving attacks, model interpretability, and fine-tuning. These substantially expand the capabilities of evaluators to identify problems, understand causes, and address issues in a targeted manner. 

3. It examines how outside-the-box access, including details about methodology, data, code, hyperparameters, deployment, and internal evaluation findings allows for more thorough scrutiny by helping auditors design better tests and trace problems back to their sources.

4. It describes methods involving technical solutions, physical secure research environments, and legal mechanisms from other industries to enable white-box and outside-the-box access while minimizing risks of leaks of sensitive information.

The main conclusions are: (1) transparency about model access and evaluation methods is necessary to interpret audit results, and (2) white-box and outside-the-box access allow for substantially more scrutiny than black-box access alone, so should be provided when greater rigor is desired.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis of the paper's content, some of the main keywords and key terms associated with this paper include:

- Auditing
- Evaluation
- Governance 
- Regulation
- Policy
- Risk
- Fairness
- Black-box access
- White-box access 
- Adversarial attacks
- Interpretability
- Explainability
- Fine-tuning

The paper discusses different levels of access for auditing AI systems (black-box, white-box, outside-the-box), and argues that white-box and outside-the-box access allow for more thorough and meaningful audits to evaluate risks, fairness, explainability, etc. Key techniques enabled by white-box access that are discussed include adversarial attacks, interpretability methods, and fine-tuning. The paper also relates auditing to governance frameworks and regulations calling for AI system assessments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper argues that white-box and outside-the-box access allow for more thorough audits of AI systems. What are some specific examples of vulnerabilities or issues that could be identified with white-box access that would likely be missed with only black-box access?

2. The paper discusses technical, physical, and legal mechanisms for allowing white-box access while minimizing security risks. Can you expand more on the tradeoffs between these approaches? Which seems most promising and what are the limitations? 

3. Gradient-based white-box attacks are highlighted as being more effective than black-box attacks. However, generating adversarial text inputs via gradients has challenges. What are some state-of-the-art techniques for overcoming these challenges? How much more room for improvement is there?

4. The paper argues that studying a model's internal representations with white-box access can offer stronger assurances about capabilities and knowledge the system has or lacks. What are some limitations of common interpretability techniques for identifying concepts in neural networks? How can these be addressed?  

5. Fine-tuning is discussed as a technique for searching for harmful dormant capabilities in models. What are some ways developers try to mitigate risks from fine-tuning today? Why might these fail according to recent works?

6. The paper argues outside-the-box access to training methodology helps auditors design more useful tests. What are some examples of how knowledge of the training process has revealed issues in AI systems in prior work? What risks exist even with rigorous methodology?  

7. What are some ways limited or narrow auditing scope could undermine oversight, even given white-box access? What structural factors drive narrow auditing scope and how might these be addressed?   

8. The paper warns black-box audits may set a precedent for lax future norms. What are some ways industry and governments are already pushing for limited auditing access? How might this be combatted?

9. What systemic factors drive conflicts of interest in auditing? How have these manifested historically in other industries? What signs are there that similar dynamics may emerge in AI auditing?  

10. What tactics do companies use to shape governance regimes and evade scrutiny more broadly? Which of these pose the greatest risks of undermining AI auditing even if access expanded?
