# [Navigating the Unknown: Uncertainty-Aware Compute-in-Memory Autonomy of   Edge Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17481)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pose estimation for tiny insect-scale drones is challenging due to their limited payload capacity. Onboard processing requires low power consumption. 
- Environments are dynamic (lighting, movements) which reduces localization accuracy over time. 
- Deterministic algorithms provide no measure of uncertainty/confidence in predictions. This is problematic for risk-aware decision making in autonomous systems.

Proposed Solution:
- Leverage compute-in-memory (CIM) processing for accelerating Bayesian/probabilistic algorithms. CIM minimizes data movement energy.
- Present two CIM-based frameworks:
  1) Particle filtering for drone localization using CIM inverter arrays to evaluate likelihoods. Uses co-designed map models to simplify computations.
  2) Acceleration of Monte Carlo Dropout variational inference for visual odometry. CIM hardware generates dropout bitstreams to emulate sampling. Enables uncertainty quantification.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate possibility to perform sophisticated Bayesian computations with minimal resources using CIM.
- Co-design methodologies that optimize models for CIM constraints to maximize parallelism and simplicity.
- Benchmarking shows particle filtering with 25x energy reduction vs processor.
- Visual odometry operates at 3 TOPS/W even with sampling-based uncertainty quantification.

Overall the paper shows CIM's potential to enable robust and efficient probabilistic algorithms suitable for tiny autonomous drones via algorithm/hardware co-design. The CIM substrates provide uncertainty quantification critical for safe operation.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my analysis, the main contribution of this paper is presenting methodologies for accelerating uncertainty-aware prediction algorithms, specifically particle filtering and Bayesian deep learning, using compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures. 

Some key points regarding the main contribution:

- The paper discusses how CIM can enable efficient implementation of particle filtering for drone localization by co-designing the map models and likelihood computation using inverter-based circuits. This allows leveraging the analog computation properties of CMOS inverters for efficient probabilistic inference.

This includes embedded dropout bit generators using SRAM write port leakage currents and optimization strategies like compute reuse across sampling iterations.  

- The overarching theme is co-designing the CIM hardware and the Bayesian algorithms to unlock substantial improvements in processing efficiency. This makes uncertainty-aware prediction viable within the tight power budgets of edge devices like insect-scale drones.

In summary, the main contribution is facilitating efficient CIM-based implementations of particle filtering and Bayesian neural networks for enabling uncertainty-aware intelligence on resource-constrained edge devices. The paper compiles insights from prior works and underscores the significance of algorithm-hardware co-design in this context.
