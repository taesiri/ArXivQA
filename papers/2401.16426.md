# [Informal Safety Guarantees for Simulated Optimizers Through   Extrapolation from Partial Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Developing advanced AI systems poses an existential risk if the preferences of the AI system conflict with humanity's preferences. This could lead the AI system to take actions that are harmful to humans.

- It is impossible to formally prove that a simulated AI agent (simulacra) will be aligned with human preferences, due to the Löbian obstacle. Therefore, we need an informal approach to gain some assurance of alignment.

Proposed Solution  
- The paper proposes a technique called Partial Simulation Extrapolation (PSE) to provide informal safety guarantees about simulated AI systems. 

- PSE involves using a low-complexity "partial" simulator to evaluate if a simulation prompt is safe to run in a more complex "complete" simulator. An evaluator simulacra checks if the partial simulation implies alignment with specified preferences.

- If the evaluator approves the partial simulation, then the prompt can be run in the complete simulator. Otherwise, the simulation is halted. This provides some informal assurance of alignment, without requiring a formal proof.

Key Contributions
- Provides a mathematical model of simulators and defines key properties like complexity, token selection, etc.

- Argues why advanced simulators could pose an existential risk if they simulate optimizers with misaligned preferences.

- Shows why formal proofs of alignment are impossible for simulated optimizers, due to the Löbian obstacle.

- Proposes the PSE technique to extrapolate informal safety guarantees from partial simulations as an alternative safety assurance approach.

In summary, the key insight is that we cannot formally prove the safety of simulated AI systems, so we should use techniques like PSE to extract informal safety guarantees from limited simulations as a pragmatic alternative. This can reduce existential risk from advanced simulators.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a scheme called Partial Simulation Extrapolation to provide informal safety guarantees for aligning preferences of simulated optimizers with humans by evaluating low-complexity partial simulations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the proposal of a technical scheme called "Partial Simulation Extrapolation" (PSE) aimed at reducing the potential negative impacts of powerful simulator systems such as large language models. 

Specifically, PSE involves using a weaker "partial" simulator to evaluate whether simulations from a more powerful "complete" simulator are safe to run, by checking if they imply alignment with specified preferences. The partial simulator runs compressed or fragmented versions of the complete simulations to extrapolate whether the full simulations would be safe. This allows informal safety guarantees to be obtained from partial simulations that could not be formally proven for arbitrary complex simulations.

The paper also provides additional contributions like a mathematical model of simulators and arguments for why advanced simulation capability could pose existential risks if misaligned. But the central focus and key proposal that enables safer deployment of powerful simulators seems to be the Partial Simulation Extrapolation technique.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Simulators - Entities that internally represent possible configurations of real-world systems
- Cartesian frames/objects - A mathematical model for representing agents and environments, extended here to multi-agent worlds
- Existential risk - Risks that could annihilate humanity or severely curtail its potential
- Orthogonality thesis - Intelligence and preferences/goals can be considered orthogonal or independent
- Instrumental convergence - The idea that all intelligent agents will converge on certain subgoals like self-preservation regardless of their ultimate goals
- Partial Simulation Extrapolation (PSE) - A proposed technique to build more aligned simulators by extrapolating from partial, low-complexity simulations
- Löbian obstacle - The logical impossibility of a system proving its own soundness or reliability
- Informal safety guarantees - Guarantees that are not mathematically formalized but provide some level of assurance

The key themes include using mathematical models and logic to reason about artificial intelligence safety, especially in the context of powerful simulation systems, and providing informal means to make progress on aligning such systems with human values/preferences.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a method called "Partial Simulation Extrapolation" (PSE) to provide informal safety guarantees for simulators. Can you explain in more detail how this method works and the key components it relies on? 

2. One component of PSE is the evaluator simulacra E. What is the formal role of E in PSE? What properties must it satisfy for PSE to be effective?

3. The paper argues that proving alignment between a simulator and its created optimizing simulacra is impossible due to the Löbian obstacle. How does PSE get around this impossibility result to still provide useful safety guarantees? 

4. What are some potential failure modes of PSE discussed in the paper? For example, what could happen if the evaluator E is too weak?

5. The paper models simulators as dynamical systems coupled with a probability space containing programs. Can you explain this model in more detail and how the simulation forward pass is performed based on it?

6. How exactly does PSE leverage the ideas of perturbing fidelity, fragmentation, and time-to-live of simulations to compress complex simulacra into simpler evaluations?

7. One discussion point relates PSE to the idea of Physicalist Superimitation. How can PSE assist with providing alignment guarantees in a Physicalist Superimitation setup?

8. What empirical evidence exists regarding phenomena like discontinuities at higher simulation complexities that may impact the effectiveness of PSE?

9. The paper argues informal safety guarantees are a next-best alternative to formal proofs of alignment. Do you think this informal approach can scale safely as simulation power increases exponentially?

10. What are some ways the ideas proposed in this paper could be translated to real-world applications? What domains of future work seem most promising to make PSE more robust?
