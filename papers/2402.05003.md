# [Efficient Invariant Kalman Filter for Inertial-based Odometry with   Large-sample Environmental Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05003)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Filtering methods like extended Kalman filter (EKF) are commonly used for inertial-based odometry and SLAM to estimate robot poses from measurements. However, they struggle with non-linearity in measurement models and lack theoretical guarantees on optimality. 

- This paper focuses on developing an efficient and optimal filter called efficient invariant Kalman filter (EIKF) for inertial odometry applications. The goal is to leverage large amounts of environmental measurements to achieve asymptotic optimality in terms of minimum mean squared error (MMSE).

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose an iterative update scheme based on Gauss-Newton method on Lie groups. This allows flexible iterations and adaptive initialization compared to standard EKF methods.

- A key contribution is using a √n-consistent pose estimate, obtained in closed-form from large environmental measurements, to initialize the iterative update. This leads to faster convergence with just 1 iteration.

- For camera measurements, they derive a √n-consistent pose using a modified PnP solution. For LiDAR, they use point-to-plane ICP. Both solutions have O(n) complexity.

- Theoretically, they show that with large samples, fusing the prior distribution with the ML pose estimate yields an optimal update step. Further, they prove the EIKF update achieves asymptotically identical performance with much lower complexity.

Main Contributions:

(i) Propose iterative update scheme on Lie groups with flexible iterations and adaptive initialization

(ii) Introduce √n-consistent pose estimate from large environmental measurements as initializer, with closed-form and O(n) complexity  

(iii) Show that fusing prior with ML pose is optimal update step with large samples

(iv) Prove EIKF update achieves asymptotic optimality identical to optimal update, but with far lower complexity

(v) Demonstrate superior performance of EIKF over state-of-the-art filters through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on visual-inertial and LiDAR-inertial odometry
