# [Collecting The Puzzle Pieces: Disentangled Self-Driven Human Pose   Transfer by Permuting Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we achieve effective disentanglement of human pose and texture in a self-supervised manner to enable high-quality human pose transfer without using paired training data?

The key hypothesis is that by using input permutation to shuffle image patches and remove spatial correspondence, they can eliminate pose information from the texture representation. This allows them to disentangle pose and texture in a self-supervised way without needing paired before/after images for supervision. The paper proposes and evaluates a method called PT^2 that utilizes input permutation and a dual-scale encoder to achieve this goal.

In summary, the main research question is how to do self-supervised pose/texture disentanglement for human pose transfer, and the key hypothesis is that input permutation can enable this by removing spatial/pose information from the texture representation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new self-supervised human pose transfer method called PT^2 (Pose Transfer by Permuting Textures) that disentangles pose from texture at the patch-level without requiring paired training data. This is done by randomly permuting image patches to remove pose information from the texture representation.

- Using a dual-scale encoder with different kernel sizes to handle issues that arise from the patch permutations, such as spanning patch boundaries. The small-scale encoder captures fine details while the large-scale encoder captures longer visual patterns. 

- Achieving improved pose transfer performance on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets compared to prior self-supervised methods, with results competitive with some fully supervised approaches.

- Demonstrating benefits of the unpaired training approach by directly fitting the model to new target datasets, outperforming supervised models trained on different datasets.

- Showing through ablation studies that the input permutation, dual-scale encoders, separate pose/texture branches, and other components each provide gains over removing them.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposed PT^2 approach for self-supervised pose transfer that disentangles pose and texture via patch permutations and uses dual-scale encoders to effectively transfer textures to new poses. The experiments demonstrate improved results over prior self-supervised methods and some supervised approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised human pose transfer method called PT^2 that randomly permutes image patches to disentangle pose from texture information and uses a dual-scale encoder to reduce noise and recover clothing shape details when transferring textures to a new pose.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in human pose transfer:

- The main contribution is using input permutation to disentangle pose from texture at the patch level. Most prior self-supervised pose transfer works have tried to disentangle pose and texture at the part level instead. The authors argue patch-level disentanglement enables more effective separation of pose and texture features.

- To handle issues caused by the input permutation (loss of shape information, unnatural patch boundaries), the paper uses a dense pose representation and a dual-scale encoder. Using dense pose allows better shape recovery than sparse pose representations used in prior work. The dual-scale encoder handles noise from patch boundaries.

- Experiments show superior performance over other self-supervised methods according to both automatic metrics and user studies. The method even outperforms some fully supervised techniques that require paired training data.

- The self-supervised approach has benefits for in-the-wild transfer as it can be directly fit to an unpaired target domain, unlike supervised methods. Experiments demonstrate this advantage.

Overall, the key novelties seem to be the use of input permutation for more granular disentanglement of pose and texture, along with technical contributions like the dual-scale encoder to make this approach effective. Comparisons to prior art are performed extensively. The paper shows both quantitative and qualitative improvements over related self-supervised methods.
