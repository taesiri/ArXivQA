# [Collecting The Puzzle Pieces: Disentangled Self-Driven Human Pose   Transfer by Permuting Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we achieve effective disentanglement of human pose and texture in a self-supervised manner to enable high-quality human pose transfer without using paired training data?The key hypothesis is that by using input permutation to shuffle image patches and remove spatial correspondence, they can eliminate pose information from the texture representation. This allows them to disentangle pose and texture in a self-supervised way without needing paired before/after images for supervision. The paper proposes and evaluates a method called PT^2 that utilizes input permutation and a dual-scale encoder to achieve this goal.In summary, the main research question is how to do self-supervised pose/texture disentanglement for human pose transfer, and the key hypothesis is that input permutation can enable this by removing spatial/pose information from the texture representation.
