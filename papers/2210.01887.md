# [Collecting The Puzzle Pieces: Disentangled Self-Driven Human Pose   Transfer by Permuting Textures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01887)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper seeks to address is: How can we achieve effective disentanglement of human pose and texture in a self-supervised manner to enable high-quality human pose transfer without using paired training data?

The key hypothesis is that by using input permutation to shuffle image patches and remove spatial correspondence, they can eliminate pose information from the texture representation. This allows them to disentangle pose and texture in a self-supervised way without needing paired before/after images for supervision. The paper proposes and evaluates a method called PT^2 that utilizes input permutation and a dual-scale encoder to achieve this goal.

In summary, the main research question is how to do self-supervised pose/texture disentanglement for human pose transfer, and the key hypothesis is that input permutation can enable this by removing spatial/pose information from the texture representation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

- Proposing a new self-supervised human pose transfer method called PT^2 (Pose Transfer by Permuting Textures) that disentangles pose from texture at the patch-level without requiring paired training data. This is done by randomly permuting image patches to remove pose information from the texture representation.

- Using a dual-scale encoder with different kernel sizes to handle issues that arise from the patch permutations, such as spanning patch boundaries. The small-scale encoder captures fine details while the large-scale encoder captures longer visual patterns. 

- Achieving improved pose transfer performance on DeepFashion and Market-1501 datasets compared to prior self-supervised methods, with results competitive with some fully supervised approaches.

- Demonstrating benefits of the unpaired training approach by directly fitting the model to new target datasets, outperforming supervised models trained on different datasets.

- Showing through ablation studies that the input permutation, dual-scale encoders, separate pose/texture branches, and other components each provide gains over removing them.

In summary, the main contribution appears to be the proposed PT^2 approach for self-supervised pose transfer that disentangles pose and texture via patch permutations and uses dual-scale encoders to effectively transfer textures to new poses. The experiments demonstrate improved results over prior self-supervised methods and some supervised approaches.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point of the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised human pose transfer method called PT^2 that randomly permutes image patches to disentangle pose from texture information and uses a dual-scale encoder to reduce noise and recover clothing shape details when transferring textures to a new pose.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research in human pose transfer:

- The main contribution is using input permutation to disentangle pose from texture at the patch level. Most prior self-supervised pose transfer works have tried to disentangle pose and texture at the part level instead. The authors argue patch-level disentanglement enables more effective separation of pose and texture features.

- To handle issues caused by the input permutation (loss of shape information, unnatural patch boundaries), the paper uses a dense pose representation and a dual-scale encoder. Using dense pose allows better shape recovery than sparse pose representations used in prior work. The dual-scale encoder handles noise from patch boundaries.

- Experiments show superior performance over other self-supervised methods according to both automatic metrics and user studies. The method even outperforms some fully supervised techniques that require paired training data.

- The self-supervised approach has benefits for in-the-wild transfer as it can be directly fit to an unpaired target domain, unlike supervised methods. Experiments demonstrate this advantage.

Overall, the key novelties seem to be the use of input permutation for more granular disentanglement of pose and texture, along with technical contributions like the dual-scale encoder to make this approach effective. Comparisons to prior art are performed extensively. The paper shows both quantitative and qualitative improvements over related self-supervised methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different network architectures and objective functions for the texture and pose encoders to improve disentanglement and detail preservation. The authors mention that the encoders currently use a simple convolutional architecture and could likely be improved with more advanced designs.

- Investigating conditional adversarial networks and other techniques to generate higher resolution images. The current approach operates on relatively low resolution 256x176 images on DeepFashion. Scaling to higher resolutions could improve results.

- Extending the approach to video pose transfer by enforcing temporal consistency across frames. The current method transfers poses on single images.

- Incorporating geometric constraints during training to ensure plausible deformations of clothing items after pose transfer. The paper notes that artifacts can occur when clothing stretches in unrealistic ways.

- Replacing the offline DensePose model with an online trainable version to avoid issues caused by DensePose errors on the input. An end-to-end learned pose representation could improve robustness.

- Exploring semi-supervised or few-shot training regimes using a small amount of paired training data. The authors note their unpaired approach could compliment these techniques.

- Applying the texture and pose disentanglement idea to related generation tasks such as novel view synthesis or text-to-image generation.

In summary, the main directions are improving the network architecture and training objectives, generating higher resolution outputs, extending to video and semi-supervised scenarios, enforcing geometric constraints, replacing DensePose, and applying the core ideas to other problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-driven human pose transfer method called PT^2 that disentangles pose from texture at the patch-level to enable high quality pose transfer without requiring paired training data. The key idea is to remove pose information from the input image by randomly permuting small image patches so only texture remains. The texture is encoded via a dual-scale encoder to reduce noise and recover clothing shape information from the permuted patches. The texture features are then sampled based on the target pose features using a cross-attention module and decoded to generate the new image. Experiments on DeepFashion and Market-1501 show PT^2 outperforms other self-driven methods in automatic metrics and user studies. The patch-level disentanglement of texture and pose enables effective texture transfer and shape recovery without requiring paired training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for human pose transfer called Pose Transfer by Permuting Textures (PT^2). The key idea is to disentangle pose from texture at the patch-level by randomly permuting image patches, removing pose information so only texture remains. The original image is then reconstructed by sampling patches from the permuted textures based on the target pose. This patch-level disentanglement enables more effective separation of pose and texture features compared to prior methods that operate at the part-level. However, permuting patches loses clothing shape information and introduces noise at patch boundaries. To address this, the method uses a dense pose representation to model shape changes and a dual-scale encoder with different kernel sizes to reduce noise and recover clothing details. 

The proposed PT^2 model consists of three branches - a source pose branch, target pose branch, and texture branch. The source pose and texture are permuted, then encoded with the dual-scale encoder. Features are sampled via cross-attention based on target pose features, then merged and decoded into the generated person. A separate background inpainting network fills in the background. Experiments on DeepFashion and Market-1501 show PT^2 significantly outperforms prior self-supervised methods in image quality metrics and user studies. The results are comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods trained with paired data. Ablations demonstrate the benefits of the proposed input permutation and dual-scale encoder components.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a self-supervised human pose transfer method called PT^2 that disentangles pose from texture information by randomly permuting image patches of the input image. This removes pose information from the patches while preserving texture details. The permuted patches are then encoded using a dual-scale encoder with both large and small convolutional kernels to recover shape information and fine details, respectively. The encoded features are combined with the target pose features using a cross-attention module to sample relevant textures for the target pose. Finally, the sampled features are decoded and combined with an inpainted background to generate a new image of the person in the target pose. The key aspects are the input permutation for disentanglement and the dual-scale encoder for shape and detail recovery when transferring the permuted textures to the target pose.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper proposes a new method for human pose transfer that addresses two key challenges in this task: 

1) Effectively disentangling the pose and texture information in an image of a person. Prior methods attempt this disentanglement at the part level by segmenting the person into parts, but pose information can still remain in the part-level features. The paper proposes a new approach to remove pose information by randomly permuting small patches of the image, creating a texture sample space devoid of the original pose.

2) Preserving texture details when transferring to a new pose. The permutation of patches can introduce noise across patch boundaries. To address this, the method uses a dual-scale encoder with different kernel sizes - one to capture fine details within patches, and one to capture longer-range patterns. 

The core ideas are patching permutation for disentangling pose and texture coupled with the dual-scale encoder for reconstructing textures given a new target pose. Experiments show this approach leads to higher quality texture transfer and pose manipulation versus prior self-supervised methods.
