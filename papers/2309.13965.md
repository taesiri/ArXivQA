# [May I Ask a Follow-up Question? Understanding the Benefits of   Conversations in Neural Network Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13965)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How do free-form conversations with XAI experts affect users' comprehension, acceptance, and trust of static explanations from AI models?

Specifically, the paper investigates whether conversing with XAI experts can:

1) Improve users' objective and subjective understanding of static explanations generated by XAI methods like LIME and Grad-CAM. 

2) Enhance users' acceptance of static explanations, measured through perceived usefulness, ease of use, and behavioral intention based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).

3) Increase users' trust in the reliability and competence of static explanation methods.

4) Help users better collaborate with explanations to select the most accurate AI model.

The overarching goal is to understand if free-form conversational explanations can complement static explanations to provide more dynamic, personalized, and effective explanations for users with diverse backgrounds and expertise levels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is investigating the benefits of conversations in enhancing explainability of AI models. Specifically, the paper conducts Wizard-of-Oz experiments where participants engage in free-form conversations with XAI experts to clarify their understanding of provided static explanations. 

The key findings are:

- Conversations significantly improve participants' comprehension of static explanations, both objectively (ability to select the best model using explanations) and subjectively (self-reported understanding).

- Conversations enhance participants' acceptance (perceived usefulness, ease of use, behavioral intention) and trust in static explanation methods. 

- Analysis of conversations reveals that participants' questions are diverse and often unanticipated. This highlights the need for customized explanations adapted through dialogues.

In summary, the paper provides empirical evidence that conversations can strengthen static explanations by resolving user confusion, establishing common ground, and providing dynamic and personalized explanations. The findings advocate for integrating conversational capabilities in future XAI systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates whether free-form conversations with AI experts can enhance users' comprehension, acceptance, and trust in static explanations of neural networks, and finds through a user study that such conversations do significantly improve users' objective and subjective understanding, acceptance, and trust.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on conversational explanations for AI systems:

- The main contribution of this paper is providing empirical evidence through user studies on the benefits of conversational explanations over static explanations. Most prior work has theorized about the potential of conversational explanations, but there is limited quantitative evaluation on their effects. So this paper provides valuable insights by actually testing conversational explanations with users.

- The Wizard-of-Oz methodology used in the studies is quite unique for researching conversational explanations. Many prior works have focused on building prototype conversational systems, whereas this paper takes a different approach by having human experts interact with users. This allows collecting natural conversations without being limited by current dialogue system capabilities.

- The paper thoroughly evaluates various aspects impacted by conversational explanations - comprehension, acceptance, trust, collaboration. In contrast, existing works have typically focused on just one or two of these dimensions when studying explanations. The multi-faceted evaluation provides a more comprehensive understanding.

- Most work on conversational explanations consider machine learning practitioners as the target users. But this paper evaluates with layperson users from diverse backgrounds, making the findings more applicable to real-world XAI scenarios. 

- The analysis of collected conversations provides useful insights into users' questions which can inform future conversational systems. Many papers on conversational XAI do not deeply analyze the dialogues.

- The paper focuses on feature attribution methods for image classification. Findings may not generalize directly to other explanation methods or data modalities like text.

Overall, this paper makes excellent contributions by conducting rigorous user studies to demonstrate the significant benefits of conversational explanations. The Wizard-of-Oz approach and multi-faceted evaluation methodology are strong suits. The paper provides both quantitative results and qualitative insights that advance our understanding of effective human-AI interaction through conversational explanations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Extend the study to cover other types of explanation methods beyond feature attribution methods like LIME and Grad-CAM. The authors note that the applicability of their findings to other methods like example-based explanations remains an open question. 

- Compare the performance of different explanation methods through conversational interactions. The current study focused on the effects of conversations and did not evaluate comparative performance of methods.

- Explore if less reliable explanations negatively impact users' comprehension, acceptance, and trust compared to more reasonable explanations. The current explanations were chosen to reasonably explain the model's predictions.

- Evaluate whether the trust exhibited by users after conversations is justified or potentially misplaced. The current study did not assess if the increased trust is warranted. 

- Conduct similar studies with participants from diverse cultural backgrounds to understand if cultural nuances influence behaviors and preferences of users seeking explanations. The current study was limited to one geographical region.

- Design conversational agents that can explain model decisions and explanations, using insights from the analysis of real user questions collected in this study. For example, covering extensive AI/XAI concepts, generating new explanations, and interpreting visual diagrams.

- Extend conversations to identify and resolve user misconceptions about explanations uncovered in this study, like misunderstanding heatmaps.

In summary, the authors suggest extending this approach to other explanation methods, evaluating comparative performance, validating user trust, recruiting diverse participants, building conversational agents for XAI, and targeting common user misconceptions as interesting future work.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a 2 paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates whether free-form conversations can enhance users' comprehension of static explanations from machine learning models, improve acceptance and trust in the explanation methods, and facilitate human-AI collaboration. The authors conduct Wizard-of-Oz experiments where participants are first presented with examples of static explanations generated by LIME and Grad-CAM methods. They then carry out a textual conversation with an AI system (played by an XAI expert) to clarify any doubts about the explanations. 

Before and after the conversation, the authors measure participants' objective understanding through a decision-making task of selecting the most accurate model among three candidates based solely on the explanations. They also measure subjective perceptions of the explanations in terms of comprehension, acceptance, and trust using validated survey questions. Results show that conversations significantly improve both objective and subjective understanding of the explanations. Participants also report increased acceptance and trust in the explanation methods after conversing with the AI. The study highlights the importance of customized explanations through natural conversations to enhance model interpretability.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a study investigating the benefits of conversations in enhancing users' understanding, acceptance, and trust of static explanations from AI models. 

The main method is as follows:

The authors conducted a Wizard-of-Oz experiment where 60 participants from diverse backgrounds interacted with an AI system through text. First, participants were shown examples of static explanations (Grad-CAM and LIME) for an image classification model's predictions. They then completed objective and subjective evaluations to measure their comprehension, acceptance, and trust of the explanations. Next, participants had a free-form conversation with an AI expert to clarify any confusion about the static explanations. The experts answered questions faithfully based on their XAI knowledge. After the conversation, participants completed the same evaluations again. 

By comparing the pre and post-conversation results, the authors evaluated the impact of conversations on enhancing comprehension, acceptance, and trust of static explanations. The objective evaluation required participants to select the best performing model out of three candidates solely based on the explanations. The subjective evaluation consisted of 13 Likert-scale questions probing self-reported understanding, acceptance, and trust. Conversations were also analyzed to gain insights.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is investigating the impact of free-form conversations on helping users understand and trust static explanations for neural network models. Specifically, it addresses the following questions:

1. How can free-form conversations enhance users' comprehension of static explanations generated by XAI methods? 

2. Can conversations improve users' acceptance and trust in explanation methods?

3. Can conversations help users collaborate more effectively with explanations, such as selecting the best AI model based on the explanations?

The paper notes that most current XAI methods provide one-off static explanations that cannot adapt to users' diverse backgrounds and levels of understanding. The authors argue that free-form conversations could allow users to ask follow-up questions and receive tailored explanations. 

To address these questions, the authors conduct a user study where participants are first presented with static explanations of neural network predictions. They then have a conversation with an AI expert to clarify any confusion. By comparing users' understanding, acceptance, trust, and ability to select the best model before and after the conversation, the study aims to quantify the benefits of conversational explanations.

In summary, the key research questions are about whether conversations can enhance static explanations by improving users' comprehension, trust, and collaboration when working with AI systems. The study seeks to provide empirical evidence to demonstrate the value of conversational explanations.
