# Tiny LVLM-eHub: Early Multimodal Experiments with Bard

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a comprehensive yet lightweight evaluation suite to assess the multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), with a particular focus on the capabilities of Google's Bard model?  The key components of this research question are:- Evaluating LVLMs: The paper aims to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LVLMs, which are models that can process both visual and textual data. - Comprehensive evaluation: The goal is to evaluate various multimodal capabilities such as visual perception, reasoning, knowledge acquisition etc. in a holistic manner.- Lightweight evaluation suite: The paper proposes "Tiny LVLM-eHub" which is a lightweight version of a more extensive LVLM evaluation hub, making it easy to use.- Focus on Bard: There is a particular emphasis on evaluating the capabilities of Google's Bard, given its recent release and exceptional multimodal abilities.So in summary, the central research question is around developing a simplified yet comprehensive evaluation framework targeted at assessing the multimodal capabilities of LVLM models, with a focus on benchmarking the latest Bard model from Google. The Tiny LVLM-eHub is proposed as a solution to this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing Tiny LVLM-eHub, a lightweight evaluation suite for assessing the multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), with a focus on evaluating Bard. 2. Developing a new evaluation metric called ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE) that aims to provide more robust and accurate assessment compared to naive word matching when evaluating open-ended predicted answers against reference answers.3. Providing the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of Bard's capabilities across 6 areas - visual perception, knowledge acquisition, reasoning, commonsense, hallucination robustness, and embodied intelligence. The results show Bard outperforming prior LVLMs on most capabilities except commonsense and hallucination.4. Presenting extensive qualitative analysis through demos to exhibit Bard's potential in multimodal applications like image captioning, visual QA, image-to-code generation etc. The demos also reveal some limitations like poor mathematical reasoning.5. Revealing through Tiny LVLM-eHub that while Bard shows exceptional proficiency on many multimodal tasks, it still faces challenges in effectively acquiring certain visual concepts and overcoming object hallucination issues.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing Tiny LVLM-eHub as a lightweight yet systematic evaluation suite for assessing multimodal capabilities of LVLMs, with a particular focus on providing the first comprehensive analysis of Bard using the proposed benchmark.
