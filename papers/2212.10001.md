# [Towards Understanding Chain-of-Thought Prompting: An Empirical Study of   What Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10001)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

What are the key aspects of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting rationales that make the technique effective in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models?

In particular, the paper investigates:

1) How important is the validity of reasoning in the CoT prompting examples for achieving good performance? 

2) If valid reasoning is not crucial, then what other aspects of the demonstrated reasoning steps contribute most to the effectiveness of CoT prompting?

To summarize, the paper seeks to gain a deeper understanding of what makes CoT prompting work by examining the importance of different components of the CoT rationales through a series of ablation studies. The key research questions revolve around unraveling the role of reasoning validity and identifying other key factors that determine the success of CoT prompting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Conducting extensive ablation studies to understand the key aspects that make Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting effective for improving the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). 

2. Finding that the validity of the reasoning steps in CoT demonstrations matters surprisingly little - providing invalid reasoning steps leads to only a small drop in model performance.

3. Identifying relevance to the input query and coherence in ordering of steps as the most crucial factors for effective CoT prompting.

4. Proposing new ways to quantify the prior knowledge LLMs have on reasoning tasks, by intentionally perturbing the CoT demonstrations. 

5. Raising important discussions on how LLMs learn (or fail to learn) from CoT prompts, their reliance on prior knowledge, and reflections on benchmarking few-shot reasoning.

In summary, this paper provides novel analysis to reveal insights into the inner workings of CoT prompting, an influential technique for few-shot reasoning. The findings challenge common intuitions and lead to new perspectives on evaluating and interpreting LLM reasoning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- This paper focuses specifically on understanding and analyzing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for large language models. Other recent work has proposed variants or extensions of CoT, like exploring different decoding strategies or automating the construction of prompts. But this paper focuses directly on understanding the key factors that make the original CoT method effective through ablation studies. 

- There is some related work that also aims to analyze or understand CoT prompting. Concurrent work by Madaan et al. makes CoT prompts counterfactual to study component importance. Ye et al. explores corrupting CoT demonstrations. Saparov et al. parses CoT rationales into logical forms. However, this paper shows more drastically that even invalid reasoning in CoT prompts has little impact on performance, and identifies relevance and coherence as key through controlled settings.

- More broadly, there is a line of work trying to understand in-context learning. Min et al. showed ground truth mappings often don't matter much. Webson & Pavlick found instruction following is robust to irrelevant instructions. This paper contributes an analysis targeted at CoT prompting for multi-step reasoning tasks. The findings suggest models may rely more on prior knowledge rather than few-shot learning during CoT prompting.

- Overall, a key contribution of this paper is the extensive ablation study to reveal model behaviors during CoT prompting. The findings open new questions around how reasoning abilities demonstrated during CoT prompting relate to prior knowledge versus few-shot learning. The paper makes important steps toward better understanding prompting-based evaluation of reasoning.

In summary, this paper provides novel in-depth analysis and insights into CoT prompting through controlled experiments, contributing to the growing literature on understanding prompt-based evaluation. The findings highlight interesting areas for future work on assessing reasoning abilities.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Developing better ways to intrinsically evaluate the quality of generated rationales, beyond just checking for correctness of key intermediate results. The authors mention that their current evaluation based on bridging objects does not fully capture coherence and reasoning dependencies. New methods are needed for more comprehensive intrinsic evaluation without requiring ground truth annotations.

- Extending the ablation study to other types of reasoning tasks beyond arithmetic and factual QA. The authors mention extending their designs to more "reduced" symbolic reasoning tasks that are highly template-based could be an interesting direction.

- Giving a more systematic treatment to constructing invalid reasoning for the demonstrations, such as following categorizations of common informal logical fallacies.

- Identifying or constructing alternative benchmarks where language models have less prior knowledge, to more faithfully evaluate few-shot learning of reasoning skills. The authors suggest their work reveals the models' existing reasoning abilities, so evaluating on novel tasks is needed.

- Further investigation into when and how language models can learn skills like reasoning purely in-context, complementary to the findings here. The authors mention some recent work has shown in-context learning is possible in certain settings.

- Exploring the impacts of different pretraining objectives, data, and model architectures on chain of thought prompting. The authors observe some inconsistencies between different models tested.

In summary, the main directions are developing better evaluation methods for rationales, extending the analysis to new reasoning tasks, constructing better benchmarks, further probing in-context learning, and understanding how model properties affect chain of thought prompting.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents an empirical study to understand what makes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting effective for improving the reasoning skills of large language models (LLMs). CoT prompting provides intermediate reasoning steps as demonstrations to encourage the LLM to verbalize its reasoning process. Through a series of ablation experiments on arithmetic and multi-hop QA datasets, the authors find that the validity of the reasoning steps in CoT demonstrations matters surprisingly little - providing even invalid reasoning steps still yields over 80-90% of CoT performance. Further experiments reveal that relevance of the demonstrations to the query, and coherence in ordering the steps, are much more important factors. These findings suggest LLMs already have strong reasoning skills from pretraining, and CoT prompts may simply direct them to generate reasoning in a coherent, query-relevant format. The work provides new insights on few-shot learning of reasoning by LLMs, and raises questions about benchmarking their true reasoning capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. CoT prompting provides example rationales that demonstrate intermediate reasoning steps when giving the model a few query-answer demonstrations. The authors conduct an empirical study to understand which aspects of the demonstrated reasoning steps contribute most to the performance gains from CoT prompting. They find that the validity of the reasoning in the examples matters surprisingly little - providing invalid reasoning steps still achieves over 80-90% of CoT performance under various metrics. Further experiments reveal that other aspects like relevance to the query and correct ordering of steps are much more important for effective CoT reasoning. 

Overall, the findings suggest that large language models may not actually learn much about reasoning from the CoT demonstrations. Rather, they already possess strong reasoning skills from pretraining, and the demonstrations mainly serve to elicit such skills by specifying an output format encouraging step-by-step reasoning that is coherent and pertinent to the query. The authors discuss implications of these findings, including new perspectives on evaluating few-shot reasoning capabilities of large models in light of their immense prior knowledge.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve the multi-step reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). In CoT prompting, in addition to providing query-answer demonstration pairs, a rationale is also provided that shows the intermediate reasoning steps. For example, for an arithmetic word problem, the query would be the problem text, the answer would be the numerical solution, and the rationale would show the mathematical equations and calculations used to derive the answer. CoT prompting encourages the LLM to explicitly generate its reasoning process during inference. The authors conduct a series of ablation studies where they modify the rationales in the demonstrations in various ways, such as making them invalid or decreasing coherence/relevance. They evaluate both the final answer accuracy as well as the quality of the generated rationales. The results show that validity of the demonstrations matters surprisingly little, while relevance and coherence are key for CoT performance. This suggests that LLMs may already have strong reasoning skills from pretraining, and the demonstrations mainly serve to elicit reasoning in a particular format.

The main method used is CoT prompting of LLMs with query-answer-rationale demonstrations. The rationales are systematically ablated in the experiments to study what aspects contribute to CoT's performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my understanding of the key points in the paper, here is a one sentence summary: 

The paper analyzes Chain-of-Thought prompting through ablation studies and finds that while validity of reasoning in demonstrations has a small impact, relevance to the query and coherence of reasoning steps are key for the strong performance of Chain-of-Thought prompting.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It aims to analyze and understand what makes Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting effective for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). CoT prompting provides example demonstrations that include intermediate reasoning steps, which encourages the LLM to explicitly generate its reasoning process. 

- The paper investigates whether valid and logically sound reasoning in the CoT demonstrations is important for the effectiveness of CoT prompting. Surprisingly, it finds that providing invalid reasoning steps in the demonstrations still achieves over 80-90% of CoT performance under various metrics.

- Through further experiments, the paper identifies that being relevant to the query and correctly ordering the reasoning steps are more important aspects of CoT demonstrations than logical validity. Keeping relevance and coherence leads to much higher performance compared to invalid but logically coherent reasoning.

- The findings suggest LLMs may not actually learn much about reasoning from CoT demonstrations. Rather, CoT acts more as a format/output space that elicits reasoning skills the LLM already gained through pretraining. 

- The paper argues these results reveal limitations in current evaluation of few-shot reasoning, and benchmarking should focus on tasks with less prior knowledge to better assess reasoning ability.

In summary, the key question is understanding what enables the effectiveness of CoT prompting for reasoning, and the findings suggest validity of reasoning matters less than expected compared to relevance and coherence. The results reveal insights into how LLMs utilize context and their limitations in few-shot learning.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where models are provided with demonstrations that include intermediate reasoning steps towards the final answer. Through a series of experiments on arithmetic reasoning and multi-hop question answering, the authors make several important findings. First, they show that valid reasoning in the demonstration examples matters surprisingly little - providing invalid reasoning steps still allows models to achieve over 80-90% of CoT performance. Further analysis reveals that relevance to the query and correctly ordering the reasoning steps are more crucial for effective CoT prompting. Overall, these results suggest that models may already possess substantial reasoning abilities from pretraining, and the demonstrations serve more to elicit this capability by structuring the output space and enforcing coherence/relevance constraints. The work provides new insights into CoT prompting, and raises important questions about how well models truly acquire new reasoning skills versus utilizing existing knowledge.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where demonstrations with step-by-step rationales are provided to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors conduct ablation studies where they deliberately provide invalid reasoning steps or alter other aspects of the rationales in the demonstrations.
