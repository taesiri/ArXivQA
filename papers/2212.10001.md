# Towards Understanding Chain-of-Thought Prompting: An Empirical Study of   What Matters

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: What are the key aspects of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting rationales that make the technique effective in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models?In particular, the paper investigates:1) How important is the validity of reasoning in the CoT prompting examples for achieving good performance? 2) If valid reasoning is not crucial, then what other aspects of the demonstrated reasoning steps contribute most to the effectiveness of CoT prompting?To summarize, the paper seeks to gain a deeper understanding of what makes CoT prompting work by examining the importance of different components of the CoT rationales through a series of ablation studies. The key research questions revolve around unraveling the role of reasoning validity and identifying other key factors that determine the success of CoT prompting.
