# [LPNL: Scalable Link Prediction with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) for graph learning is an emerging research direction. However, learning on large-scale heterogeneous graphs poses significant challenges due to the overwhelming amount of information. 
- Specifically for the link prediction task, as the number of candidate nodes increases, the textual prompt fed into the LLM becomes too long and exceeds token limitations.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LPNL, a LLM-based framework for scalable link prediction on large heterogeneous graphs.
- A novel prompt template is designed to articulate graph details into natural language queries for link prediction. 
- A two-stage sampling pipeline is proposed to extract crucial nodes from the graph, ensuring focus on more informative nodes.
- To address long prompts with excessive candidates, a divide-and-conquer strategy partitions candidates into smaller sets for separate prediction. 

Main Contributions:
- Design of tailored prompts to query LLMs for graph-based link prediction.
- A two-stage sampling method to select informative nodes from large graphs.
- A divide-and-conquer approach to handle many candidate nodes within length constraints.
- Extensive experiments showing LPNL outperforms GNN baselines on large-scale academic graphs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.
- Analysis of few-shot learning capability and knowledge transfer across domains.

In summary, the paper explores using LLMs for scalable link prediction on large heterogeneous graphs, proposing the LPNL framework that handles node sampling, prompt design and prediction strategies tailored for this graph learning task. Both methodology and experiments showcase the potential of leveraging LLMs for problems on graphs.
