# MultiInstruct: Improving Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Learning via Instruction   Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper tries to address is: Can instruction tuning be effectively applied to multimodal models to improve their generalization and zero-shot performance on unseen multimodal tasks?The key hypotheses related to this question are:1. Creating a multimodal instruction tuning dataset (MultiInstruct) with diverse tasks and multiple expert instructions per task will enable more effective instruction tuning for multimodal models. 2. Transfer learning strategies like mixed instruction tuning and sequential instruction tuning can help leverage large text-only instruction datasets (like Natural Instructions) to further improve multimodal instruction tuning.3. Increasing the diversity of tasks and instructions used for instruction tuning will reduce the model's sensitivity to variations in task instructions.4. Multimodal instruction tuning will improve the model's performance on unseen multimodal tasks as well as unseen NLP tasks compared to the baseline pretrained model.So in summary, the central research question is whether instruction tuning can be effectively extended to multimodal models and tasks to improve their generalization ability, and the key hypotheses aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal instruction tuning techniques. The experiments and results then seek to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes MultiInstruct, the first large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal instruction tuning. MultiInstruct contains 62 diverse tasks covering 10 broad categories, with each task associated with multiple expert-written instructions. 2. It demonstrates the effectiveness of instruction tuning for improving the zero-shot performance of multimodal pretrained models. By finetuning OFA on MultiInstruct, the model's zero-shot performance on various unseen multimodal tasks is significantly improved.3. It explores several transfer learning strategies like Mixed Instruction Tuning and Sequential Instruction Tuning to leverage the large-scale text-only Natural Instructions dataset to further enhance the zero-shot performance. 4. It designs a new evaluation metric called Sensitivity to assess how sensitive the model is to variations in the wording of instructions. Results show instruction tuning reduces the model's sensitivity.5. It performs comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to analyze the impact of the number of tasks, number of instructions, and different training strategies on the model's overall performance and sensitivity.In summary, the key contributions are proposing MultiInstruct as a new multimodal instruction tuning benchmark, demonstrating the benefits of instruction tuning for multimodal models, and designing a new Sensitivity metric to evaluate instruction-tuned models. The paper provides useful insights into how to effectively perform instruction tuning for multimodal pretrained models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a new multimodal instruction tuning dataset called Multi-Instruct, and shows that fine-tuning models like OFA on it improves zero-shot performance on unseen multimodal tasks compared to baselines, while transfer learning from large text-only instruction datasets can further enhance performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of multimodal instruction tuning:- This paper introduces MultiInstruct, the first large-scale multimodal instruction tuning dataset. Previous instruction tuning datasets like Natural Instructions focused only on language tasks, so MultiInstruct represents an important advance in expanding instruction tuning to multimodal tasks.- The paper explores transfer learning strategies like mixed instruction tuning and sequential instruction tuning to leverage the large text-only Natural Instructions dataset. Other works have not investigated how to effectively transfer capabilities from text instruction tuning to multimodal tasks.- The paper uses the OFA model, demonstrating instruction tuning on modern large multimodal pretrained models. Some prior instruction tuning work used smaller or text-only models like BART. Using OFA shows the potential for scaling up instruction tuning.- The paper proposes a new metric, Sensitivity, to measure robustness to instruction wording variations. This provides a more nuanced evaluation than just average performance across instructions. Other works have not formally measured this.- Compared to concurrent work exploring prompt/instruction tuning for multimodal models, this paper does more systematic analysis on factors like number of tasks and instructions, transfer learning strategies, etc. Other works are more preliminary.Overall, the paper makes several notable contributions in terms of the dataset, transfer learning ideas, use of state-of-the-art models like OFA, and metrics like Sensitivity. The analysis is fairly comprehensive compared to related concurrent work. The paper represents a significant advance in expanding instruction tuning to multimodal domains.
