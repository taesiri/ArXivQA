# [Time Series Compression using Quaternion Valued Neural Networks and   Quaternion Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11722)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Time series data from sensors, IoT devices etc is often very long due to high sampling rates or recording times. This makes processing with machine learning models difficult as recurrent architectures struggle with long sequences.
- Long time series also require more storage, have higher training times, and can increase transmission latency and energy usage which is problematic.
- Simple downsampling techniques like taking the mean lose information about variability in the data.

Proposed Solution:
- Novel quaternion-based time series compression method:
   - Divide long time series into segments
   - Extract min, max, mean and standard deviation of each segment
   - Encapsulate these 4 statistics into a quaternion - preserving their relationship
   - This compresses the time series while retaining more information

- Process the compressed quaternion data using quaternion neural network layers and quaternion backpropagation
- Apply on Tennessee Eastman process control dataset for fault classification

Main Contributions:
- New time series compression approach yielding shorter quaternion-valued time series
- Derivation of full quaternion backpropagation using GHR calculus to enable valid product and chain rules
- Analysis of relation between quaternion backpropagation and automatic differentiation
- Experimental comparison showing quaternion models outperform real-valued counterparts in both supervised and self-supervised setups
- Improve previous best accuracy on dataset from 81.43% to 83.90% using proposed compression and quaternion model

In summary, the paper introduces a novel quaternion-based method to compress time series in a way that retains more information compared to taking simple statistics like the mean. It then leverages quaternion algebra properties by using quaternion neural networks, made trainable through a properly derived backpropagation algorithm, to effectively process the compressed data. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy by combining the compression and quaternion modelling innovations.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a novel time-series compression methodology where long time-series are divided into segments, statistics like min, max, mean and standard deviation are extracted from each segment, and these statistics are encapsulated into a quaternion to get a compressed quaternion time-series.

2) It derives a novel quaternion backpropagation algorithm using the GHR calculus, which enables a valid product and chain rule for derivatives in quaternion space. Detailed formulas for quaternion neural network optimization are provided.  

3) It investigates the connection between the derived quaternion backpropagation and automatic differentiation, revealing when automatic differentiation can be used to train quaternion neural networks.

4) It applies the proposed compression methodology and quaternion neural networks for fault classification on the Tennessee Eastman dataset, outperforming real-valued baseline models. It also shows superior performance compared to prior work using a self-supervised contrastive learning approach.

In summary, the main contributions are - a new quaternion time-series compression technique, novel quaternion backpropagation derivation, insights on relation with automatic differentiation, and experimental validation on fault classification showing advantages over real-valued models.
