# [Python Fuzzing for Trustworthy Machine Learning Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12723)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are complex, critical software that form the foundation for many AI systems. Ensuring their security and reliability is important for building trustworthy AI. However, their large, multi-language codebases make them challenging targets for comprehensive testing. Fuzzing is an effective technique to uncover vulnerabilities, but requires solving issues like quality fuzz targets, coverage measurement, and efficient crash triaging.

Solution:
The authors propose a fuzzing pipeline for Python projects using Sydr-Fuzz. Key components include:

- Fuzzing the Python API with coverage-guided Atheris engine to test Python and native C/C++ code. Seed corpus minimization done before and after fuzzing.

- Coverage collection with coverage.py for metrics and visualization in multiple formats like HTML. 

- Automated crash triaging with Casr by collecting reports, deduplication and clustering crashes, estimating severity. Makes analysis manageable.

- Pipeline integration in GitLab CI for continuous fuzzing. Builds Docker containers to run targets and collects results like crashes, coverage and logs.

They analyze the attack surface of ML frameworks to focus testing on Python bindings, core C/C++ functions, and third party modules. Fuzz targets are written for PyTorch JIT, h5py file handling, and TensorFlow IO.

Contributions:

- Implementation of an automated fuzzing pipeline for Python with corpus minimization, coverage and crash triaging.

- Discovery of 3 new bugs in PyTorch, its dependency flatbuffers, and in HDF5 storage interface used by h5py. Provided fixes.

- First implementation of crash triaging for Python fuzzing with automated deduplication, clustering and readable reports. Simplifies debugging.

Overall the paper demonstrates an effective pipeline tailored to fuzz complex Python projects like ML frameworks. Automation and smart corpus minimization, coverage metrics, and crash analysis allow improved efficiency.
