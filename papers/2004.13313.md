# [Modularized Transfomer-based Ranking Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13313)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can we design a modular Transformer architecture for information retrieval that achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness while being faster and more interpretable than existing black-box Transformer rankers?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Existing Transformer rankers like BERT simultaneously perform representation and interaction when processing a concatenated query-document input. 

2) By disentangling representation and interaction into separate modules, we can pre-compute representations offline and keep online computation focused only on the interaction. This can make ranking faster.

3) Separating representation and interaction also assigns clear roles to different components, making the model more interpretable. 

4) This modular architecture can match the effectiveness of previous monolithic Transformer rankers.

To summarize, the central research question is around developing a modular Transformer ranking framework that is efficient, interpretable, and effective compared to prior monolithic approaches. The key hypotheses focus on how decomposing ranking into representation and interaction modules can help achieve these goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Proposing the MORES framework which modularizes the Transformer ranker into separate modules for text representation and interaction. This enables faster ranking by pre-computing representations offline and only doing lightweight interaction online. 

2. Demonstrating that MORES can match the effectiveness of state-of-the-art BERT rankers on a large supervised ranking dataset, while being up to 120x faster due to representation reuse.

3. Showing via domain adaptation experiments that MORES' modular design does not hurt transfer ability, allowing it to be used in low-resource settings.

4. Using the modular design to gain new understanding about Transformer rankers. The experiments reveal differences between adapting representations vs interaction across domains. The attention analysis also sheds light on the dual role of query-document attention - understanding the query and matching query-document tokens.

5. Proposing techniques to effectively train and initialize MORES using BERT weights, without needing expensive pre-training.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be proposing the interpretable and efficient MORES framework as a replacement for BERT rankers, while retaining effectiveness. The modular design also enables better understanding of Transformer ranking models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some ways this paper compares to other research in natural language processing and information retrieval:

- The key contribution is proposing a modularized architecture for Transformer-based ranking models, separating representation and interaction. This is a novel way to structure Transformer rankers compared to prior work like BERT for ranking which uses the standard Transformer encoder architecture. 

- It shows the benefits of modularization and decomposition for efficiency and interpretability. Other work has explored model efficiency, but this connects efficiency gains directly to the module decomposition. The analysis of separate representation and interaction modules for interpretability purposes is also novel.

- It explores different strategies to precompute and reuse document representations for faster query evaluation. Building query-agnostic offline representations is a common technique in IR, but exploring this in the context of Transformer rankers is new.

- The adaptation experiments provide insight about domain transferability of different model components. Most prior work looks at adapting full models. Analyzing adaptation of modules separately is an interesting analysis.

- Overall, the paper pushes Transformer ranking research in a novel direction of modular model architecture. It connects this decomposition to benefits like efficiency, interpretability, and transferability that prior BERT ranking research did not explore. The analysis and techniques around precomputing representations are also tailored to the proposed modules.

In summary, the key novelty is the proposed modular architecture itself. The paper does a nice job motivating it and exploring the unique advantages it provides compared to standard Transformer ranker models. The efficiency, analysis, and adaptation experiments are enabled specifically by the modular decomposition.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Designing specific pre-training tasks to better initialize the Interaction Module in MORES. The current initialization method of copying BERT self-attention weights is not ideal, since it is not tailored for modeling query-document interactions. The authors suggest exploring pre-training objectives that can learn interaction patterns to improve MORES.

- Exploring more efficient Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms that can be plugged into the different modules of MORES to further improve speed. The paper notes that techniques like sparse attention are orthogonal to their approach and can potentially combine together.

- Studying what linguistic properties are captured by the Representation vs Interaction Modules through probing tasks and analysis. The authors demonstrate MORES can provide interpretability, and suggest more work can be done to really understand the roles of the different modules.

- Extending MORES to other IR tasks beyond ranking, such as query understanding, document understanding, etc. The representation and interaction split may be useful for other problems.

- Architectures to allow updating indexed document representations over time without full re-computation. The paper mentions allowing query representations to change without impacting static document representations.

- Pre-training the Interaction Module with objectives tailored for modeling query-document interactions, rather than just copying BERT self-attention weights.

- Testing MORES on very large-scale ranking settings with billions of documents. The paper focuses on efficiency so this is a natural direction.

In summary, the main suggested directions are improving MORES through better pre-training and more efficient architectures, extending MORES to other tasks, and further analysis of MORES to better understand representation and interaction in ranking.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modularized transformer-based framework called MORES that decouples ranking into separate modules for document representation, query representation, and interaction, enabling faster ranking by precomputing representations while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and better interpretability.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes MORES, a modularized transformer-based framework that decouples ranking into separate modules for text representation and interaction. By having independent Document and Query Representation Modules that can run offline/online, and a lightweight online Interaction Module, MORES achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ranking while being substantially faster than standard transformer rankers. Experiments show MORES matches a BERT ranker in accuracy but is 120x faster due to representation reuse. MORES also transfers well to low-resource domains via simple adaptation. By adapting modules individually, the paper finds representations need more domain customization while interaction patterns are more generalizable. The interpretable modular design also provides new analysis on transformer rankers - showing ranking relies on both query understanding and query-document matching, with the former less recognized before. Overall, the modularization enables efficiency, adaptability and interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a modular Transformer ranking framework called MORES that decouples ranking into Document Representation, Query Representation, and Interaction modules. The Representation Modules embed documents and queries independently using Transformer encoders. The Interaction Module then performs query-to-document attention and query self-attention to generate match signals and a relevance score. By disentangling representation and interaction, MORES enables pre-computing document representations offline while keeping online computation focused only on query representation and interaction. The paper shows MORES achieves similar effectiveness as a BERT ranker on a large supervised ranking task while being up to 120x faster due to representation reuse. A domain adaptation experiment also demonstrates MORESâ€™ transfer ability and sheds light on differences between adapting representations versus interaction. Overall, the modular design makes MORES efficient, effective for ranking, and more interpretable than black-box Transformer rankers.

In summary, this paper proposes a novel modular Transformer framework called MORES that divides ranking into offline document representation, online query representation, and lightweight interaction modules. Experiments show MORES matches state-of-the-art BERT ranker accuracy while being substantially faster through representation reuse. The modular architecture also makes MORES more interpretable.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces MORES (Modularized Reranking System), a Transformer-based neural ranking framework that decouples ranking into separate modules for text representation and interaction. 

The key components of MORES are:

1) Document Representation Module and Query Representation Module: These modules use Transformer encoders to independently embed document and query tokens. 

2) Interaction Module: This module performs query-to-document cross-attention to generate match signals, followed by query self-attention to aggregate signals. It uses novel Interaction Blocks (IB) that avoid expensive full query-document attention.

3) Representation Reuse Strategies: MORES can pre-compute document representations offline and reuse them to avoid recomputation per query. Two strategies are proposed - storing representations directly, or storing intermediate projected representations from the Interaction Module.

4) Initialization from BERT: MORES is initialized from BERT weights to leverage pretraining, by splitting BERT into document module, query module and interaction module (IBs).

The modular design enables efficient ranking by precomputing representations offline and keeping online interaction lightweight. Experiments show MORES matches state-of-the-art BERT ranker accuracy while being substantially faster. The modules are also more interpretable than BERT blackbox.
