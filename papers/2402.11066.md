# [Towards Financially Inclusive Credit Products Through Financial Time   Series Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11066)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
Modern financial institutions face challenges providing inclusive credit, savings, and insurance products because they lack the ability to understand consumer financial behavior and risk without relying on restrictive conventional credit scoring techniques. Customer segmentation based on spending patterns can promote financial inclusion, but requires labeled data. As labels are expensive, unsupervised clustering is an attractive alternative. However, standard clustering algorithms struggle with time series data like financial transaction histories. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors present a deep learning-based time series clustering approach tailored for financial transaction data to enable financial institutions to understand customer spending behaviors. Their solution has four key components:

1) Autoencoder architecture to learn representations of transaction histories 
2) Dimensionality reduction techniques 
3) Auxiliary pretext tasks for representation learning 
4) Clustering objectives to group similar spending behaviors

Through systematic experiments, the authors identify the best component choices and combine them into a novel algorithm called Financial Transaction History Clustering (FTHC).

Main Contributions:
- Taxonomy of deep time series clustering algorithms into interchangeable components  
- Analysis of each component's impact on clustering performance
- Identification of best components for financial transaction data
- Novel FTHC algorithm outperforming state-of-the-art financial time series clustering techniques
- Enable financial institutions to understand customer spending behaviors and provide tailored, inclusive financial products 

In summary, the paper presents a principled way to develop specialized time series clustering algorithms and an application to promote financial inclusion by clustering financial transaction histories to reveal consumer spending behaviors.
