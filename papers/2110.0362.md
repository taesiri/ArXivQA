# [Dynamics of targeted ransomware negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.0362)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How has the development of targeted ransomware affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations, and what insights can game theory provide into responding to ransomware attacks?The authors state this focus early on in the Introduction:"In this paper, we consider how the development of targeted ransomware has affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations to better understand how to respond to ransomware attacks."They then construct a game theory model of ransomware negotiations to analyze the strategies and investments a malicious actor must make to conduct a successful targeted attack. The goal is to gain new insights into real-world ransomware behavior and optimal response strategies.So in summary, the main research focus is on using game theory to model targeted ransomware negotiations, in order to elucidate how the dynamics have changed and determine optimal responses. The hypothesis is that game theory can provide useful insights into these ransomware attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker (malicious actor operating ransomware) and a defender (targeted organization). The key features of the model are:- It focuses on the attacker's investments in reliability of the ransomware, estimating the value of the target's data, and level of aggression in negotiations. - It shows how imperfect information leads to the necessity of negotiations, in contrast to a trivial "ideal scenario" where the attacker has perfect information.- It demonstrates through analysis and simulations that the attacker's optimal strategy balances investment and aggression, rather than maximizing aggression.- It provides insights into real-world ransomware negotiation strategies and dynamics through the game theory framework. Overall, the main contribution is using game theory to model ransomware negotiations in a novel way that captures key features of real-world targeted ransomware campaigns. The analysis provides new theoretical understanding of ransomware negotiation dynamics and strategies.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper develops a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between attackers and targets to understand the dynamics and optimal strategies involved.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of ransomware modeling:- The use of game theory to model ransomware negotiations is a relatively new approach. Some other papers have used game theory, but focused on different aspects like deterrence or incentive to return data. This paper provides a detailed game theoretic model specifically focused on the dynamics of ransom negotiations.- Most prior ransomware modeling research has not focused on targeted ransomware attacks on large organizations. This paper incorporates unique features of targeted ransomware like the attacker's need to invest in estimating the value of the target's data. - The model includes imperfect information as a key element affecting the negotiations. Many game theory models assume perfect information, but this paper shows how imperfect information leads to non-trivial optimal strategies.- Compared to basic economic or cost-benefit models of ransomware, this game theory approach provides more strategic insights into the behavior of attackers and defenders. However, the tradeoff is that game theory models require more simplifying assumptions.- The detailed numerical analysis of the model parameters and profit landscapes goes beyond high-level game theory and shows how the results match with agent-based simulations. This helps verify the model reflects real-world dynamics.- Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by bringing game theory modeling to targeted ransomware negotiations. The analysis provides new strategic insights compared to prior ransomware research. The results highlight the importance of balancing aggression and investment for ransomware attackers.
