# [Dynamics of targeted ransomware negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.0362)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How has the development of targeted ransomware affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations, and what insights can game theory provide into responding to ransomware attacks?The authors state this focus early on in the Introduction:"In this paper, we consider how the development of targeted ransomware has affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations to better understand how to respond to ransomware attacks."They then construct a game theory model of ransomware negotiations to analyze the strategies and investments a malicious actor must make to conduct a successful targeted attack. The goal is to gain new insights into real-world ransomware behavior and optimal response strategies.So in summary, the main research focus is on using game theory to model targeted ransomware negotiations, in order to elucidate how the dynamics have changed and determine optimal responses. The hypothesis is that game theory can provide useful insights into these ransomware attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker (malicious actor operating ransomware) and a defender (targeted organization). The key features of the model are:- It focuses on the attacker's investments in reliability of the ransomware, estimating the value of the target's data, and level of aggression in negotiations. - It shows how imperfect information leads to the necessity of negotiations, in contrast to a trivial "ideal scenario" where the attacker has perfect information.- It demonstrates through analysis and simulations that the attacker's optimal strategy balances investment and aggression, rather than maximizing aggression.- It provides insights into real-world ransomware negotiation strategies and dynamics through the game theory framework. Overall, the main contribution is using game theory to model ransomware negotiations in a novel way that captures key features of real-world targeted ransomware campaigns. The analysis provides new theoretical understanding of ransomware negotiation dynamics and strategies.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of ransomware modeling:- The use of game theory to model ransomware negotiations is a relatively new approach. Some other papers have used game theory, but focused on different aspects like deterrence or incentive to return data. This paper provides a detailed game theoretic model specifically focused on the dynamics of ransom negotiations.- Most prior ransomware modeling research has not focused on targeted ransomware attacks on large organizations. This paper incorporates unique features of targeted ransomware like the attacker's need to invest in estimating the value of the target's data. - The model includes imperfect information as a key element affecting the negotiations. Many game theory models assume perfect information, but this paper shows how imperfect information leads to non-trivial optimal strategies.- Compared to basic economic or cost-benefit models of ransomware, this game theory approach provides more strategic insights into the behavior of attackers and defenders. However, the tradeoff is that game theory models require more simplifying assumptions.- The detailed numerical analysis of the model parameters and profit landscapes goes beyond high-level game theory and shows how the results match with agent-based simulations. This helps verify the model reflects real-world dynamics.- Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution by bringing game theory modeling to targeted ransomware negotiations. The analysis provides new strategic insights compared to prior ransomware research. The results highlight the importance of balancing aggression and investment for ransomware attackers.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:- Incorporating the attacker's investment in circumventing the defender's security into the model. The paper currently focuses just on the ransom negotiation stage and does not account for the attacker's efforts to breach the defender's systems. Adding this element could allow for modeling deterrence effects based on the defender's security investments.- Expanding the model to allow for multiple rounds of negotiation offers and counteroffers over time. The current model simplifies the process into a single offer and counteroffer. A more complex negotiation process may reveal additional insights. - Considering other factors that influence the ransom amount and negotiation, such as the attacker's costs of providing decryption support and files. The model currently focuses just on reliability of decryption. - Analyzing targeted ransomware strains in more detail to quantify differences in aggression, reliability, accuracy, and other model parameters. The paper currently uses illustrative values for these parameters. More precise values could improve the model's accuracy.- Expanding the model to account for the sale of stolen data during targeted attacks, not just ransom for decryption keys. The dynamics around data theft and extortion could produce further insights.- Applying game theory to model ransomware scenarios beyond just targeted attacks, such as mass untargeted ransomware campaigns. Different attack types may require modifications or entirely new models.In summary, the authors propose enhancing the model's complexity and linkage to real-world data, expanding its scope to related ransomware scenarios, and diversifying the factors considered in the negotiation dynamics. Game theory provides a useful foundation to analyze ransomware economics and interactions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper develops a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker operating targeted ransomware and a defender organization that has been infected. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy that affect negotiations - aggression, investment in reliability of the ransomware, and investment in estimating the value of the target's data. By analyzing the model, the authors show how imperfect information necessitates negotiation and determines optimal strategies. They find the attacker must balance investment and aggression to maximize profit, rather than being infinitely aggressive. The analysis provides insights into real-world ransomware negotiations by modeling the interaction of strategy elements under imperfect information. Overall, the paper applies game theory concepts to model ransomware negotiations and gain a better understanding of the behavior and incentives of actors involved.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper constructs a game theory model to analyze the dynamics of ransomware negotiations between attackers operating targeted ransomware strains and organizations targeted for attack. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy: investment in circumventing the target's security, investment in the reliability of the ransomware code, and investment in estimating the value the target places on their encrypted data. The negotiation is modeled as a two-player game, with the attacker making a ransom demand and the target making a counteroffer. If the counteroffer is too low, the attacker may react aggressively by refusing to provide the decryption key. Through analysis of the model, the authors show how imperfect information necessitates negotiation, as the attacker can never perfectly estimate the target's valuation of their data. The optimal level of aggression balances the attacker's ability to demand higher ransoms against the risk of aggressive rejection of reasonable counteroffers. The model demonstrates how the key elements of the attacker's strategy interact, and that a balanced investment and aggression strategy maximizes the attacker's expected profit. The insights from this game theory model can aid in understanding the real-world behavior of targeted ransomware operators.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper constructs a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker operating targeted ransomware and a defender organization targeted by the attacker. The model focuses on three key elements of the attacker's strategy: investment in reliability of the ransomware, investment in estimating the value of the target's data, and level of aggression in negotiations. The negotiation is modeled as a two-player non-cooperative game with imperfect information. The defender makes a counteroffer to the attacker's ransom demand, and the attacker either accepts the counteroffer or aggressively rejects it based on a probability related to their aggression level. The model is analyzed to find optimal strategies for both players. Numerical integration and agent-based simulations demonstrate that the attacker's optimal strategy balances investment and aggression levels, rather than maximizing aggression. The imperfect information arising from the attacker's uncertain estimate of the data value makes non-trivial negotiation strategies necessary.
