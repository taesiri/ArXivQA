# [Dynamics of targeted ransomware negotiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.0362)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How has the development of targeted ransomware affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations, and what insights can game theory provide into responding to ransomware attacks?The authors state this focus early on in the Introduction:"In this paper, we consider how the development of targeted ransomware has affected the dynamics of ransomware negotiations to better understand how to respond to ransomware attacks."They then construct a game theory model of ransomware negotiations to analyze the strategies and investments a malicious actor must make to conduct a successful targeted attack. The goal is to gain new insights into real-world ransomware behavior and optimal response strategies.So in summary, the main research focus is on using game theory to model targeted ransomware negotiations, in order to elucidate how the dynamics have changed and determine optimal responses. The hypothesis is that game theory can provide useful insights into these ransomware attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing a game theory model of ransomware negotiations between an attacker (malicious actor operating ransomware) and a defender (targeted organization). The key features of the model are:- It focuses on the attacker's investments in reliability of the ransomware, estimating the value of the target's data, and level of aggression in negotiations. - It shows how imperfect information leads to the necessity of negotiations, in contrast to a trivial "ideal scenario" where the attacker has perfect information.- It demonstrates through analysis and simulations that the attacker's optimal strategy balances investment and aggression, rather than maximizing aggression.- It provides insights into real-world ransomware negotiation strategies and dynamics through the game theory framework. Overall, the main contribution is using game theory to model ransomware negotiations in a novel way that captures key features of real-world targeted ransomware campaigns. The analysis provides new theoretical understanding of ransomware negotiation dynamics and strategies.
