# [Large Language Models Need Consultants for Reasoning: Becoming an Expert   in a Complex Human System Through Behavior Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning abilities in various domains, but still struggle with complex human systems involving strategic decision-making and interactions. 
- Existing methods like fine-tuning, chain-of-thought and in-context learning have limitations in analyzing such systems due to lack of relevant data and analogical reasoning patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called "Mosaic Expert Observation Wall" (MEOW) that utilizes generative-agents-based simulation to create simulated data of a complex human system.
- This simulated data is used to train an "expert model" to make predictions about the system. 
- The predictions are then converted to natural language prompts providing "expert observations" to assist an LLM-based judge agent in reasoning about the actual complex system.

Experiments and Results:
- The method is evaluated in a Werewolf-like communication game between agents, aiming to identify a "spy" based on discussions.
- The results show that consulting the expert model trained on simulated data helps the judge agent perform better than just using chain-of-thought prompts.
- This demonstrates the ability of simulation and expert models to enhance LLM reasoning in complex strategic human systems.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework MEOW that combines generative-agents simulation and expert models to assist LLM reasoning in complex human systems.
- Demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of using simulated data to train expert models for analyzing such systems.
- Proposes a new methodology orthogonal to existing LLM reasoning methods like fine-tuning and can collaborate with them.
- Provides a data-efficient solution for reasoning in complex systems where real data is lacking.

In summary, the key innovation is using simulation to create useful data for training expert models that can provide helpful observations to improve LLM agents' reasoning abilities in complex human systems.
