# [Large Language Models Need Consultants for Reasoning: Becoming an Expert   in a Complex Human System Through Behavior Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18230)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning abilities in various domains, but still struggle with complex human systems involving strategic decision-making and interactions. 
- Existing methods like fine-tuning, chain-of-thought and in-context learning have limitations in analyzing such systems due to lack of relevant data and analogical reasoning patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new framework called "Mosaic Expert Observation Wall" (MEOW) that utilizes generative-agents-based simulation to create simulated data of a complex human system.
- This simulated data is used to train an "expert model" to make predictions about the system. 
- The predictions are then converted to natural language prompts providing "expert observations" to assist an LLM-based judge agent in reasoning about the actual complex system.

Experiments and Results:
- The method is evaluated in a Werewolf-like communication game between agents, aiming to identify a "spy" based on discussions.
- The results show that consulting the expert model trained on simulated data helps the judge agent perform better than just using chain-of-thought prompts.
- This demonstrates the ability of simulation and expert models to enhance LLM reasoning in complex strategic human systems.

Main Contributions:
- Novel framework MEOW that combines generative-agents simulation and expert models to assist LLM reasoning in complex human systems.
- Demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of using simulated data to train expert models for analyzing such systems.
- Proposes a new methodology orthogonal to existing LLM reasoning methods like fine-tuning and can collaborate with them.
- Provides a data-efficient solution for reasoning in complex systems where real data is lacking.

In summary, the key innovation is using simulation to create useful data for training expert models that can provide helpful observations to improve LLM agents' reasoning abilities in complex human systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new framework called "Mosaic Expert Observation Wall" (MEOW) that uses generative-agents-based simulation to create simulated data for training expert models, which then provide natural language expert observations to assist large language models in reasoning about complex human systems.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel methodology called "Mosaic Expert Observation Wall" (MEOW) to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in complex human systems. 

Specifically, the key points are:

1) The paper utilizes a generative-agents-based simulation technique to simulate a complex human system, which is a communication game that mirrors real-world security scenarios. This simulation generates individual-level human behavior data.

2) The simulated data are used to train expert models that concentrate "experience" about inferring players' identities in the game. The accumulated "experience" through simulation makes the models experts on this task. 

3) In the inference stage on real game data, the expert models provide LLMs with natural language prompts as expert observations to assist their reasoning. This allows LLMs to refine their analyses and improve reasoning performance.

4) Experiments show that consulting the expert models enhanced the LLM's ability to identify players' identities in the game, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed MEOW methodology in improving LLM reasoning in complex human systems.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing MEOW as a novel approach to leverage simulation and expert models to reinforce LLM reasoning in complex systems. The methodology is data-efficient and can potentially collaborate with other LLM reasoning methods like fine-tuning and chain-of-thought.
