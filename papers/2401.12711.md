# [When Redundancy Matters: Machine Teaching of Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12711)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In machine teaching, the goal is for a teacher to select a small set of examples (witness set) to teach a target concept to a learner. 
- However, concepts have many equivalent representations. This redundancy affects the search space and makes it hard for teacher and learner to determine equivalence classes.

Proposed Solution: 
- Instead of teaching concepts, explore the idea of teaching representations. 
- Define representations and witnesses with size functions, and total orders on them.  
- Introduce 3 teaching schemas that handle redundancy differently:
   - Eager: Teacher provides minimum witness for simplest representation. Learner guesses simplest consistent representation. 
   - Greedy: Iteratively assign smallest unused witness to simplest unused consistent representation.
   - Optimal: Find best possible teacher mapping with minimal constraints.

- Formally analyze and experimentally evaluate the 3 schemas on languages with different redundancy (Boolean expressions, P3 programs).

Main Contributions:

- Introduce notion of teaching representations rather than concepts, better reflecting how humans teach concepts using representations.

- Define new metric "redundancy spread" that predicts when Greedy will outperform Eager.

- Show Greedy handles redundancy better than Eager, teaching more concepts with smaller witnesses, despite using more witnesses overall.

- Demonstrate witness sets are often smaller than programs they identify, justifying usefulness of teaching by examples.

- Highlight spectrum of approaches between teaching single vs all representations per concept, shedding light on effect of redundancy in search.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores teaching representations rather than concepts in machine teaching settings with redundant languages, introducing the Greedy teaching protocol and Redundancy Spread metric, and shows theoretically and experimentally that small witness sets can effectively identify representations when exploiting redundancy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is highlighting the distinction between concepts and representations in machine teaching, and showing theoretically and experimentally how small witness sets can be when teaching representations, given the existing redundancy in common representation languages. Specifically:

- The paper introduces a formal model for teaching representations rather than concepts, where the teacher has a target representation in mind and wants the learner to identify it, even if there are other equivalent representations. This is a common real-world scenario.

- New teaching protocols Eager and Greedy are defined, as well as an Optimal baseline. Theoretical comparisons show tradeoffs between them. 

- Experiments on Boolean expressions and Turing-complete P3 programs with varying redundancy quantify the performance of these protocols. A new metric called "redundancy spread" is shown to correlate with the relative effectiveness of Eager vs Greedy.  

- Despite using more witness sets, Greedy teaches substantially more concepts than Eager, while still teaching some common concepts with smaller witness sets. For P3, witness sets are usually smaller than the programs they identify, justifying the meaningfulness of teaching programs from examples.

In summary, by distinguishing concepts and representations, the paper provides formal and empirical evidence that small witness sets can suffice for teaching representations, given the redundancy present in common languages. This highlights the relevance of representations over concepts in machine teaching.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Machine teaching - The paper explores formal models of machine teaching, where a teacher provides carefully chosen examples to allow a learner to reconstruct a target concept.

- Representations - The paper considers the issue that concepts can have many equivalent representations, which affects the teaching process. It explores teaching representations rather than just concepts.

- Redundancy - The paper analyzes different languages and representations in terms of their redundancy. Redundancy is defined formally in terms of the number of representations per concept.

- Redundancy spread - A new metric introduced to capture how spread out redundant representations are in the ordering, which impacts teaching performance.

- Teaching protocols - Different teaching protocols are analyzed, including Eager, Greedy, and Optimal. These make different assumptions about the teaching process.

- Experiments - Experiments compare the teaching protocols on different representation languages, including Boolean expressions and P3 programs.

- Witness size - An important consideration is the size of witness sets needed to teach concepts or representations. The results show witness sets can be quite small compared to representations.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the machine teaching methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces the idea of teaching representations rather than concepts. What are some potential benefits and drawbacks of focusing on teaching representations? When would this approach be preferred over traditional concept teaching?

2. The paper defines several teaching protocols - Eager, Greedy, and Optimal. How do they differ in terms of computational complexity? What kinds of concept classes or representations might each protocol be best suited for? 

3. The Greedy teaching protocol is shown to often use smaller witness sets than Eager. What properties of the representation language or concept class explain when Greedy outperforms Eager? How does the new metric of redundancy spread relate?

4. Theorem 2 shows that Greedy will never use larger witnesses than Eager on concepts both methods teach. What is an intuitive explanation for why this theorem holds? Are there cases where the witnesses could be the same size?

5. The paper shows there are concept classes where Greedy requires much larger witness sets than Optimal. Can you provide an example construction demonstrating this and analyze the asymptotic difference?

6. An open question is raised about the binary matrix minimizing the number of projection vectors. What approaches might you try to tackle this question? What related problems does it connect to? 

7. For the experiments, what meaningful insights do Tables 2 and 3 provide into the relative strengths of the teaching protocols? How do the results align with or diverge from theoretical predications?  

8. Figure 3 shows an interesting property of P3 programs learned by Greedy. Why does this finding help justify the relevance of machine teaching from examples?

9. How might the introducing of duplicate representations in the experiments, as done for 3-Term DNF with permutations and duplicates, change the behavior of the teaching methods?

10. The paper argues teaching representations is relevant for applications like explainable AI. What are some other potential real-world motivations and uses for the representation teaching perspective?
