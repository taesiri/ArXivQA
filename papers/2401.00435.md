# [Bidirectional Trained Tree-Structured Decoder for Handwritten   Mathematical Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00435)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) is challenging due to visual confusions caused by writing variations, ambiguities, and noise. This leads to symbol misclassifications.
- Existing HMER methods fail to effectively utilize bidirectional context information, especially for tree decoder models. Tree decoders offer better structure analysis but weaker language modeling compared to string decoders.
- The contributions of visual perception and linguistic perception have not been fully analyzed in HMER. As data volume grows, properly enhancing linguistic perception becomes critical.

Proposed Solutions:
- Introduce a novel Mirror-Flipped Symbol Layout Tree (MF-SLT) to provide right-to-left tree label for bidirectional training of tree decoders.
- Propose Bidirectional Asynchronous Training (BAT) architecture that allows bidirectional interaction between left-to-right and right-to-left decoders at both training and inference stages.
- Analyze impact of visual vs linguistic perception - with more data, linguistic perception contributes much more. Hence propose Shared Language Modeling (SLM) to enhance linguistic modeling without extra parameters.

Main Contributions:
- Extend bidirectional training strategy to tree decoders through novel MF-SLT labels. Achieve new SOTA results.
- BAT architecture enables effective utilization of bidirectional context in both training and inference.
- Separately examine visual and linguistic contributions. SLM enhances linguistic robustness to address visual confusions.
- BAT and SLM concepts improve performance and can generalize to both tree and string HMER decoders.

In summary, the key novelty lies in effectively incorporating bidirectional context for tree decoders, analyzing linguistic impact, and using BAT plus SLM concepts to achieve new state-of-the-art HMER performance.
