# [WilKE: Wise-Layer Knowledge Editor for Lifelong Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10987)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on single edits, but fail in lifelong editing which requires continuous edits over time. 
- Experiments reveal two issues that cause performance degradation in lifelong editing:
    - Toxicity buildup: Minor changes accumulate over edits, gradually harming model performance.  
    - Toxicity flash: Certain edits suddenly modify parameters abnormally, overfitting the model.
- The underlying cause is pattern mismatch - predefined editing layers used by methods like ROME and MEMIT do not match where knowledge is actually stored across layers.

Proposed Solution - WilKE:
- Selects editing layer based on degree of pattern match for each knowledge item across layers. 
- No need for predefined editing layers. Matches knowledge patterns to best layer.
- To edit: Introduces residual term on matched layer. Optimizes residual to align outputs. Allocates optimized residual to update parameters.

Contributions:  
- Identifies toxicity buildup and flash issues in lifelong editing. Links them to pattern mismatch across layers.
- Proposes WilKE to select editing layer per knowledge item based on pattern match.
- Experiments show WilKE substantially outperforms ROME and MEMIT in lifelong editing on GPT-2 XL and GPT-J, improving average scores by 46.2% and 67.8%.
- Provides valuable insights into knowledge storage and editing in LLMs to guide future work.

In summary, the paper identifies and analyzes key challenges in lifelong knowledge editing, proposes a pattern matching based editing approach to address them, and demonstrates significant improvements compared to prior state-of-the-art methods.
