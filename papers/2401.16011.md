# [GPS: Graph Contrastive Learning via Multi-scale Augmented Views from   Adversarial Pooling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16011)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing self-supervised graph representation learning methods rely on handcrafted augmentation strategies to generate positive views for graph contrastive learning. However, these strategies require expert knowledge to select appropriate augmentations and may fail to generate challenging positive views that provide sufficient supervision signals. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel framework called Graph Pooling ContraSt (GPS) that leverages learnable graph pooling techniques to automatically generate multi-scale augmented views:

1) Strongly-augmented view: Removes more redundant info to provide challenging positives.

2) Weakly-augmented view: Preserves more semantics. 

Two graph pooling modules with different node retain ratios are used to generate the two views.

The framework has:

1) Similarity learning: Maximizes agreement between original graph and weakly-augmented view.

2) Consistency learning: Encourages similarity structure consistency between distributions of two views.

3) Adversarial learning: Trains pooling modules against encoder for robustness.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to leverage learnable graph pooling for generating augmented views in graph contrastive learning.

2) Introduces multi-scale views with different emphases on semantic preservation and challenging positives.

3) Joint contrastive learning framework with similarity and consistency losses for exploring both views.

4) Adversarially trains pooling modules against encoder for efficiency.

5) Comprehensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines on 12 datasets for graph classification, clustering, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning.

The paper proposes a novel graph contrastive learning framework called "GPS" which leverages graph pooling techniques to automatically generate multi-scale augmented views of graphs for more effective contrastive learning. The key ideas include using graph pooling to create a "strongly-augmented view" and "weakly-augmented view", developing similarity and consistency losses over these views, and adversarial training between the graph encoder and pooling modules. Experiments are conducted on graph classification and transfer learning tasks over 12 datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
