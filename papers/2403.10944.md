# [Human Centered AI for Indian Legal Text Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10944)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Recent advancements in generative AI have not translated well to impactful legal applications due to issues like low trustworthiness and lack of specialized datasets. 
- There is a need for human-centered AI systems that can enhance performance of large language models (LLMs) on legal text analytics tasks to match human expertise.

Proposed Solution: 
- Introduce a novel dataset annotated for legal text analytics tasks like question answering, summarization and petition drafting. 
- Propose a human-centered compound AI system comprising of LLMs that principally incorporates human inputs at all stages to perform legal text analytics tasks. 
- Identify areas where human expertise can significantly improve LLM performance on tasks like case similarity, judgment summarization, petition drafting and question answering.

Key Contributions:
- Analysis of existing legal text analytics tasks and performance of LLMs on them.
- Introduction of a new dataset for training and evaluating models.
- Description of a human-centered compound AI system for legal text analytics using LLMs.
- Commentary on how human inputs at different stages can enhance LLM performance on tasks like case similarity, judgment summarization, petition drafting and question answering.
- Discussion of future work to develop InLegalLLaMA, a LLaMA model pre-trained on Indian legal corpora and instruction-tuned for legal text analytics tasks.

The paper makes a strong case for developing human-centered AI systems for legal text analytics that strategically incorporate human expertise to match performance of experts on specialized tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This position paper explores the potential of Large Language Models for Legal Text Analytics tasks like case similarity, judgment summarization, question answering, and petition drafting, proposing a human centered, compound AI system that principally incorporates human inputs to match expert performance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a human-centered, compound AI system for performing legal text analytics (LTA) tasks using large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) The paper introduces a novel dataset annotated for LTA tasks like question answering, summarization, and petition drafting. This dataset incorporates human inputs to help train and evaluate LLMs on tasks that require expertise. 

2) The paper describes an approach to integrate human expertise into LLAMA, an LLM, to enhance its performance on Indian legal documents and match human-level capabilities on certain LTA tasks. This involves pre-training on Indian corpora, infusing legal knowledge, and fine-tuning the model on relevant downstream tasks. 

3) The paper analyzes several LTA tasks, comparing existing supervised models with the performance of LLMs when augmented with human inputs. It demonstrates cases where human interaction helps LLMs better serve the needs of legal professionals and citizens requiring access to justice.

4) The paper proposes a human-centered, compound AI system that principally incorporates human inputs to perform LTA using LLMs. It highlights potential interaction points between human actors like lawyers, citizens, activists etc. and AI-driven LTA services.

In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating how blending human expertise with the computational power of LLMs can enable impactful and trustworthy AI applications in the legal domain. The introduced dataset, proposed LLM approach, analysis of tasks and system architecture support this goal.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a human-centered compound AI system for legal text analytics. Can you elaborate on the key components of this system and how human inputs are incorporated at different stages? 

2. One of the motivations mentioned is that recent advances in generative AI have not translated into proportional rise in impactful legal applications. What are some of the reasons cited for this, especially in the Indian context?

3. The paper introduces a new dataset annotated for tasks like question answering, summarization and petition drafting. Can you describe this dataset in more detail and what types of human annotations does it contain?

4. For the case similarity task, the paper compares performance of the proposed LLaMA-2 model with previous supervised approaches. What were the key differences and how does eliciting human reasoning behind LLaMA-2's decisions help?

5. Judgment summarization is discussed as an application where both extractive and abstractive approaches are useful. What are some of the limitations of current abstractive models outlined and how can human inputs help address these?

6. The petition drafting application is described as inherently human-centered. What is the proposed approach here to identify missing information in petitions and why is this a harder task than simply drafting petitions?

7. For the question answering task, what are the different settings discussed such as closed-book QA and providing knowledge graph triples as context? How does the newly introduced dataset fit in?

8. The text2sql task is proposed to be useful for retrieval augmented generation in tasks like petition drafting. Can you explain the schema and examples generated to facilitate this?

9. The paper proposes developing a family of InLegalLLaMA models focused on Indian legal documents. What are some of the training strategies discussed to infuse domain knowledge?

10. What are the different ways and points in the legal text analytics pipeline where human inputs are elicited in the proposed human-centered compound AI system?
