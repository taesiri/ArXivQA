# [SwarMer: A Decentralized Localization Framework for Flying Light Specks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04571)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Flying Light Specks (FLSs) are miniature drones with lights that can illuminate 3D shapes in midair. However, localizing them precisely to render shapes accurately is challenging due to lack of GPS and accumulating errors in dead reckoning over long distances. 

Proposed Solution - Swarm-Merging (SwarMer):
- A decentralized relative localization framework where FLSs cooperate to form swarms. FLSs repeatedly localize relative to neighbors, which reduces distances moved and thus dead reckoning errors.

- Swarms move together. When swarms merge, one becomes an "anchor" swarm and the other calculates movement to match inter-FLS angles and distances to ground truth shape. This forces neighbors to match relative positions precisely.

- SwarMer has provisions to handle race conditions, FLS failures, FLS battery swaps, etc. It can run continuously to refine accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- The novel SwarMer framework for relative FLS localization to accurately render 2D and 3D shapes in a decentralized manner.

- Two alternative localization techniques for an FLS to position itself relative to a neighbor FLS anchor point. Quantified tradeoffs between signal strength vs physical movement.

- Comparison of SwarMer to triangulation and trilateration in accuracy. SwarMer performs better.

- MATLAB simulations and Python implementation showing SwarMer is fast, accurate, resilient, and scales to large numbers of FLSs.

- Open-sourced code and data for community use.

In summary, the paper presents a decentralized, swarm intelligence-based solution for the very challenging problem of accurately locating swarms of tiny flying drones with lights to create midair 3D illusions. The results demonstrate its effectiveness.
