# [Towards detecting unanticipated bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities, but can perpetuate harmful biases, often in subtle and unanticipated ways.  
- Most bias research focuses on known issues like gender or race. However, LLMs likely have additional implicit biases that are not obvious and could negatively impact applications.  
- Detecting these unknown biases is challenging due to the complexity and opacity of LLMs. New techniques are needed.

Proposed Solution:  
- Leverage uncertainty quantification (UQ) and explainable AI (XAI) to uncover hidden biases in LLMs after training (post-hoc).
- UQ methods like ensembles and test-time augmentation assess models' confidence. Biases likely lead to uncertainty.  
- XAI techniques explain models' reasoning. Users can spot problematic factors. Methods involve perturbations and simplifier models.
- Approach enables bias discovery on pre-trained models without access to internals.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective on detecting unanticipated biases in LLMs using UQ and XAI. 
- Emphasizes local explanations to empower users to recognize biases for their specific applications.
- Proposes user-centered tools like visualizations and feedback loops to facilitate bias mitigation.
- Discusses limitations around subjectivity of bias, model opacity, and result ambiguity.
- Significant step towards transparent and accountable LLMs that adapt to evolving societal norms of fairness.

In summary, the paper pioneers techniques to uncover hidden biases in LLMs by determining models' uncertainty and explaining their reasoning to users on a case-by-case basis. This allows the discovery of unforeseen unfairness that requires vigilance to address.
