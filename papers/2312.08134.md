## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) is an emerging research field that aims to solve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously within limited computing resources by exploiting inter-task similarities. A large number of multitask evolutionary algorithms (MTEAs) have been proposed for solving multitask optimization (MTO) problems. However, there lacks a comprehensive software platform for researchers to evaluate different MTEAs on benchmark problems and explore real-world applications. Existing platforms in evolutionary computation field cannot meet the special requirements of MTO and knowledge transfer in EMT. Moreover, current research works have inconsistent code implementations of algorithms and problems, making performance comparison difficult.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose MTO-Platform (MToP) - the first open-source MATLAB platform for EMT research. MToP provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface with test, experiment and data processing modules. It incorporates a wide range of algorithms (30+ MTEAs and 30+ single-task EAs), benchmark problems (150+ cases) and performance metrics (10+). The algorithms, problems and metrics are implemented following consistent code patterns and public APIs. MToP also includes real-world MTO applications and is extensible for adding new code.

Main Contributions:
- User-friendly GUI with specialized modules to analyze MTO problems, run comparative experiments, process data and export results  
- Abundance of implemented algorithms, benchmark problems and metrics to cover various types of EMT
- Extensibility allowing new algorithms, problems and metrics to be easily added by following code patterns
- First open-source platform to facilitate EMT research through reproducible experiments, comparison and real-world exploration
- Continual update from research community to incorporate state-of-the-art algorithms and problems

In summary, MToP significantly facilitates EMT research by providing a convenient and extensible platform for reproducible benchmarking, algorithm development and real-world applications. As an open-source project, it aims to continuously evolve through contributions from the research community.
