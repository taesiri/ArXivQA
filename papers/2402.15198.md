# [Bidirectional Uncertainty-Based Active Learning for Open Set Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Bidirectional Uncertainty-Based Active Learning for Open Set Annotation":

Problem:
- Active learning aims to reduce labeling costs by querying the most valuable examples from an unlabeled pool to train a model. 
- Existing active learning methods assume a closed-set scenario where all categories in the unlabeled pool match the target classes. 
- In open-set scenarios, the unlabeled pool contains both target classes (known classes) and irrelevant classes (unknown classes). Unknown classes can confuse existing methods.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a Bidirectional Uncertainty-based Active Learning (BUAL) framework to query valuable known-class examples.
- Use Random Label Negative Learning (RLNL) to push unknown class examples to high-confidence regions and known class ones to low-confidence regions. Achieved by randomly assigning labels and using a complementary loss.  
- Propose a Bidirectional Uncertainty (BU) sampling strategy to estimate uncertainty from both a positive classifier and negative classifier. Combine with global (openness ratio r) and local (auxiliary prediction) balancing factors.
- Extend common uncertainty sampling strategies (least confidence, margin, entropy) to leverage bidirectional uncertainty for open-set scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- Propose RLNL method to distinguish known and unknown class examples for open-set active learning.
- Design a bidirectional uncertainty measurement and sampling strategy tailored for open-set scenarios.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of BUAL framework on multiple benchmark datasets under varying openness ratios.
- Expand existing closed-set active learning methods to complex open-set situations.
