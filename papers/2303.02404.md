# [Fine-Grained Classification with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02404)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to develop an effective learning algorithm to handle noisy labels in fine-grained image classification datasets. 

The key hypotheses are:

1. Existing learning with noisy labels (LNL) methods may not perform well on fine-grained classification tasks due to the large inter-class similarity. 

2. Encouraging discriminative feature representations can help confront label noise and facilitate learning of fine-grained differences. 

3. A noise-tolerant supervised contrastive learning approach can mitigate the effects of label noise and learn robust features.

4. A stochastic feature transformation module can further augment contrastive learning without manual feature engineering.

5. The proposed framework can boost various LNL algorithms when applied to fine-grained datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes a new Stochastic Noise-tolerated Supervised Contrastive Learning (SNSCL) framework to address the challenging problem of handling noisy labels in fine-grained classification. The central hypothesis is that SNSCL can learn robust discriminative features to mitigate noise and improve classification accuracy.
