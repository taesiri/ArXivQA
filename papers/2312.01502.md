# [Normed Spaces for Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph representation learning aims to embed graph structure data into continuous spaces to facilitate machine learning tasks. Many graphs exhibit non-Euclidean properties. 
- Recent works have used Riemannian manifolds like hyperbolic spaces as embedding spaces to match these properties. However, operations in such spaces are computationally demanding.

Proposed Solution:  
- This paper proposes using normed spaces, especially $\ell_1^d$ and $\ell_\infty^d$, as more efficient alternatives for graph embedding.
- This is motivated by discrete geometry theorems showing low theoretical distortion bounds for embedding finite metric spaces like graphs into low-dimensional normed spaces. 

Main Contributions:
- Empirically evaluates graph embedding capacity of normed spaces on synthetic graphs (grids, trees etc) and real-world graphs from various domains.
- Shows normed spaces consistently outperform Euclidean space, hyperbolic space, symmetric spaces like Siegel space, SPD matrices space across graphs and metrics.
- Analyzes the robustness of normed spaces for embedding graphs of varying sizes and curvatures. Their capacity remains stable and their efficiency grows slower than Riemannian alternatives with size.  
- Demonstrates practical utility of normed spaces on link prediction using four GNN models and recommendation tasks, with $\ell_1$ space superior on many datasets.
- Concludes normed spaces offer flexible, efficient alternative to popular manifolds for graph representation, with theoretical and empirical evidence, while avoiding technical complexities.
- Discusses open questions around understanding precise workings of normed space graph embeddings and connections to theory. Limitations around theoretical guarantees and graph classes evaluated.

In summary, the paper comprehensively highlights normed spaces as promising continuous embedding spaces for graph representation learning, with empirical evidence complementing known theoretical results.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes using low-dimensional normed spaces, especially $\ell_1^d$ and $\ell_\infty^d$, as a more flexible, efficient, and technically simpler alternative to popular Riemannian manifolds for learning graph embeddings, motivated by theoretical results suggesting normed spaces can embed a wide range of finite metric spaces with low distortion.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper highlights normed spaces, particularly $\ell_1^d$ and $\ell_\infty^d$, as a more flexible, efficient, and technically simpler alternative to popular Riemannian manifolds for learning graph embeddings. The key contributions are:

1) Empirically demonstrating that diverse classes of graphs with varying structures can be embedded in low-dimensional normed spaces with low distortion, corroborating theoretical motivations from discrete geometry.

2) Showing that normed spaces consistently outperform Euclidean spaces, hyperbolic spaces, Cartesian products, Siegel spaces, and SPD matrices across a range of synthetic and real-world graph reconstruction benchmark datasets. 

3) Demonstrating the enhanced capacity of normed spaces to embed graphs of varying curvatures, and their computational efficiency advantage over other spaces as graph sizes increase.

4) Showcasing the versatility of normed spaces on applied graph embedding tasks like link prediction and recommender systems.

In summary, the paper underscores the untapped potential of normed spaces for geometric graph representation learning, sets a compelling baseline for future work, and raises new research questions around leveraging simpler geometric techniques.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper proposes using normed spaces, specifically $\ell_1^d$ and $\ell_\infty^d$, as alternatives to popular Riemannian manifolds for graph embedding. What theoretical results from discrete geometry motivate this proposal? How do these results suggest that normed spaces can effectively embed a wide range of finite metric spaces?

2. The paper evaluates the capacity of normed spaces for graph embedding through a graph reconstruction task. What is the intuition behind using graph reconstruction to evaluate how well a space preserves graph structure and geometry? What are some strengths and weaknesses of this evaluation approach?

3. The loss function used for optimization in the graph reconstruction task treats distortion of short and long paths uniformly. What asymmetry does this introduce in the loss function? Does this asymmetry negatively impact the empirical results?

4. How do the capacities of normed spaces compare to other manifolds across synthetic graphs with varying topologies and curvatures? What explains cases where normed spaces outperform or underperform Alternative spaces tailored to certain topologies?

5. As graph sizes scale up, how do the embedding capacities and computational requirements of normed spaces compare to other manifolds? What explains any differences in scalability?

6. What applications beyond graph reconstruction do the authors use to demonstrate the versatility of normed space embeddings? How do normed spaces perform in these applications compared to baselines?

7. The paper finds the $\ell_1$ norm performs better than $\ell_\infty$ for recommendation systems, while the opposite holds for graph reconstruction. What might explain this, and what questions does it raise about how embeddings leverage space geometry?

8. What theoretical guarantees are lacking from this and other work on geometric graph embedding? What are some ways to help connect the empirical results to theoretical distortion bounds?  

9. What types of graphs and graph families would be valuable to analyze further when evaluating embedding spaces? What could these experiments reveal about scalability and flexibility?

10. The work focuses on static graphs - what opportunities and challenges exist for applying normed space embeddings to dynamic graphs with evolving structure over time?
