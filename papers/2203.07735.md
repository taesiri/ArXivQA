# [Augmenting Document Representations for Dense Retrieval with   Interpolation and Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07735)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research questions/hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Can augmenting document representations improve performance for dense retrieval models, which require large amounts of labeled query-document training pairs?2) Are interpolation and perturbation effective techniques for augmenting document representations to handle unlabeled documents? 3) Can document augmentation techniques applied during training improve retrieval performance on both labeled and unlabeled documents?Specifically, the paper proposes a Document Augmentation for dense Retrieval (DAR) approach to tackle the problem of insufficient labeled query-document training pairs. The core ideas are:- Interpolate representations of a positive and negative document for a query using mixup, to create "unlabeled" examples.- Perturb representations of labeled documents using dropout, to expand the representation space. The central hypothesis is that these techniques can improve retrieval performance on both labeled (seen during training) and unlabeled (unseen) documents, without requiring additional annotation steps. Experiments on open-domain QA datasets validate this hypothesis, showing gains over baselines on both labeled and unlabeled documents.In summary, the key research questions focus on whether document augmentation via interpolation and perturbation can improve retrieval performance in a dense representation space, particularly for handling unlabeled documents, which is a major challenge. The paper provides a positive answer through empirical validation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper proposes a document augmentation method called DAR (Document Augmentation for dense Retrieval) to tackle the problem of insufficient labeled query-document pairs for training dense retrieval models. 2. The paper presents two novel document augmentation techniques:- Interpolation: Mixing the representations of a positive document (relevant to the query) and a negative document (irrelevant to the query) using mixup to obtain intermediate representations. This helps handle unlabeled documents.- Perturbation: Randomly masking the representation of a labeled document using dropout. This helps handle nearby unlabeled documents.3. Through experiments on open-domain QA datasets, the paper shows that DAR significantly improves retrieval performance on both labeled and unlabeled documents compared to previous dense retrieval baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate the positive effect of the proposed interpolation and perturbation techniques.In summary, the key contribution is a simple yet effective document augmentation framework for dense retrieval that requires minimal annotation effort but boosts performance on unlabeled data. The proposed interpolation and perturbation strategies are shown to be efficient and complementary.

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel method called Document Augmentation for dense Retrieval (DAR) which improves dense retrieval models by augmenting document representations through interpolation and perturbation techniques.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my understanding of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to related work in dense retrieval:- The paper focuses on improving dense retrieval models by augmenting the document representations during training. This is different from other work that augments query representations or generates additional query-document pairs. - For document augmentation, the paper proposes two techniques - interpolation and perturbation of document embeddings. Interpolation mixes positive and negative document embeddings to create new "soft" examples. Perturbation applies dropout to document embeddings to create multiple versions. - These techniques are shown to improve retrieval performance on standard QA datasets like Natural Questions and TriviaQA, especially for unlabeled documents not seen during training. This demonstrates the ability to handle emerging/unseen documents.- The proposed augmentation during training is more efficient than methods that explicitly generate new text queries/documents since it avoids the generation step. This is quantified in experiments.- Query augmentation is also examined as an extension and shown to be effective, highlighting the versatility of the augmentation techniques.- Analysis shows both interpolation and perturbation contribute positively, with strong results when combined. Batch size experiments indicate continued benefits even under constrained resources.- The techniques are model-agnostic and could extend to other dense retrievers beyond DPR studied here. Results on ANCE confirm benefits on an alternate model.In summary, the core novelty is in developing and demonstrating techniques for document augmentation that address key challenges in dense retrieval like handling unseen documents. The efficiency and broad applicability are additional advantages compared to prior work. The comprehensive experiments and analyses strengthen the paper's contributions.
