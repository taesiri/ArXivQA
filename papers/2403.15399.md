# [ChatGPT in Linear Algebra: Strides Forward, Steps to Go](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15399)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
This paper explores the capabilities of the AI system ChatGPT for answering questions and solving problems in linear algebra, to assess its potential as a teaching assistant or instructor. The authors test ChatGPT on practical computational problems as well as more abstract conceptual questions.  

Findings:
- ChatGPT shows immense knowledge and can provide textbook-accurate definitions, proofs and solutions to standard linear algebra problems. 
- However, when faced with more complex, non-standard or abstract problems, ChatGPT often makes logical errors, lacks understanding of key concepts, fails to identify contradictions in its own reasoning, and does not employ the most efficient problem-solving methods.

Examples:
- ChatGPT originally provided an incorrect solution for a system of linear equations, but improved to give a correct detailed solution when questioned again later. However, issues remained in handling parameters.
- It made algebraic mistakes in computing eigenvalues, requiring step-by-step guidance from the authors over multiple sessions to arrive at the right solution.  
- Abstract reasoning issues appeared in problems like: incorrectly determining if a specific vector belonged to a given subspace; struggling with conceptual questions on topics like determining if a set formed a vector space.

Conclusions:
- Despite improvements over time, ChatGPT cannot currently reliably teach linear algebra concepts without expert human guidance. It does not have true comprehension; instead it relies on statistical patterns in data. Logical gaps, inefficient methods and contradiction tolerance make it unsuitable as an independent tutor.
- However, under an instructor's supervision, it could be a useful classroom aid for students to critique solutions and develop deeper understanding of the mathematics. The flaws in ChatGPT's responses themselves reveal insights.  

Main Contributions:
- Thorough testing of ChatGPT's linear algebra abilities on basic to advanced questions, documenting its strengths and weaknesses. 
- Analysis of how certain reasoning deficiencies persist through multiple software versions.
- Discussion of ChatGPT's potential benefits in an educational setting under proper expert guidance, as well as risks if used as a standalone teaching substitute.
- Highlighting the software's lack of true conceptual understanding versus a pattern-matching statistical approach.
