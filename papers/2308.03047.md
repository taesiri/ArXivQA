# [Prototypes-oriented Transductive Few-shot Learning with Conditional   Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03047)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to effectively perform transductive few-shot learning in the challenging and realistic scenario where the query sets are class-imbalanced (i.e., have an arbitrary and unknown distribution of samples across classes)?The key ideas and contributions are:- The paper proposes a new method called Prototypes-oriented Unbiased Transfer Model (PUTM) for class-imbalanced transductive few-shot learning. - It makes the key observation that estimating the class-wise marginal distribution of the query samples accurately is crucial for good performance on class-imbalanced datasets. - The paper pioneers the use of Conditional Transport (CT) theory to effectively model the unknown prior class distribution in the query set in a data-driven, flexible manner.- PUTM employs forward and backward navigators as transport matrices to transfer statistics between prototypes and queries, balancing between uniform and adaptive class priors.- It further derives a closed form update to refine prototypes based on the learned navigators in an iterative EM algorithm.- Experiments on four benchmarks (miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB, CIFAR-FS) show PUTM achieves superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-art on class-imbalanced few-shot learning.In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling the unknown, imbalanced query distribution using conditional transport theory will lead to more effective prototype-based transductive few-shot learning on real-world class-imbalanced datasets. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper appears to make the following main contributions:- It proposes a novel transductive few-shot learning method called PUTM (Prototypes-oriented Unbiased Transfer Model) for handling class-imbalanced few-shot learning scenarios. - It leverages conditional transport (CT) theory to model the unknown prior distribution of query samples in a data-driven manner. Specifically, it uses forward and backward transport matrices (navigators) optimized with a CT loss to transfer statistics from query samples to prototypes in an unbiased way. - It further derives a closed-form MAP solution to iteratively refine the prototypes based on the learned transport matrices in an EM framework. This allows transferring unbiased statistics from queries to prototypes effectively.- Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB, CIFAR-FS) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PUTM model in handling both class-balanced and imbalanced few-shot learning. It achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods.- Ablation studies and visualization provide insights into the behavior of the learned transport matrices and prototype evolution in PUTM. The results show PUTM can adaptively capture class prior and enable robust calibration of prototypes.In summary, the key innovation is using conditional transport theory to explicitly model and leverage the unknown prior distribution in transductive few-shot learning, instead of making restrictive assumptions like uniform distribution. This allows effective unbiased transfer of statistics from queries to prototypes in class-imbalanced scenarios.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a prototypes-oriented unbiased transfer model called PUTM for class-imbalanced transductive few-shot learning that employs forward and backward navigators as transport matrices to balance the prior of query samples per class between uniform and adaptive data-driven distributions, and refines prototypes based on MAP with the learned navigators in an iterative EM-solver.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of few-shot learning:- This paper focuses on transductive few-shot learning, where unlabeled query data can be leveraged during inference on new tasks. This differs from inductive few-shot learning methods that only utilize the labeled support data. Transductive methods typically outperform inductive methods by exploiting query statistics.- A key contribution is developing a method that can handle class-imbalanced query sets, where the number of examples per class is arbitrary and unknown. Many prior transductive methods assume class-balanced query sets and fail under class imbalance. The proposed method introduces a Conditional Transport loss to model the unknown class distribution.- Most prior transductive few-shot learning methods rely on some notion of similarity between prototypes (averages of support examples per class) and individual query points. This paper argues that using conditional transport to estimate class-wise query statistics provides more robust calibration of prototypes.- The proposed PUTM method achieves strong performance compared to recent transductive methods on class-imbalanced few-shot learning. It also remains competitive on class-balanced settings. This demonstrates its flexibility.- The introduction of conditional transport to few-shot learning is novel. Conditional transport has mostly been applied in other domains like generative modeling previously. This demonstrates the potential for cross-pollination of ideas between few-shot learning and other fields.In summary, this paper makes contributions in adapting transductive few-shot learning to the practical setting of class imbalance by developing a conditional transport-based approach. It highlights the importance of estimating class distributions and provides a principled way to do so. The competitive experimental results validate this direction.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several future research directions in the conclusion:1. Explore the applicability of PUTM on more problem settings and applications, such as multi-domain few-shot classification and few-shot object detection. The authors state that in the future, they will investigate using PUTM for other few-shot learning scenarios beyond standard image classification.2. Investigate integrating PUTM with more advanced feature extractors to further improve performance. The authors note that since PUTM is agnostic to the feature extractor used, it can work with more sophisticated backbone networks to potentially achieve better results. 3. Examine adapting PUTM to other applications beyond few-shot learning, such as class-imbalanced image classification and long-tailed image classification. The authors suggest examining if the ideas behind PUTM could be applied to other imbalanced learning problems.4. Further analyze the theoretical connections between conditional transport and estimating class priors/marginal distributions for few-shot learning. The paper establishes empirical connections, but further theoretical analysis could provide more insights.In summary, the main future directions are: 1) Applying PUTM to other few-shot learning settings and applications; 2) Integrating with advanced feature extractors; 3) Adapting the approach to other imbalanced learning problems; 4) Further theoretical analysis of the conditional transport-based prior estimation. The authors aim to expand the applicability and theoretical understanding of the PUTM model.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a prototypes-oriented unbiased transfer model (PUTM) for few-shot learning in class-imbalanced scenarios. It employs conditional transport theory to learn task-adaptive transport matrices between prototypes and query samples. This allows capturing unbiased statistics from imbalanced query sets to refine the prototypes. Specifically, forward and backward transport matrices are optimized to balance between uniform and adaptive priors over class distributions. The prototypes are then iteratively refined based on the learned transport matrices following an EM algorithm. Experiments on four benchmarks show PUTM achieves strong performance under varying degrees of class imbalance compared to prior arts. The model provides a simple but effective approach for few-shot learning by exploiting conditional transport for unbiased transductive inference.
