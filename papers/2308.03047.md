# [Prototypes-oriented Transductive Few-shot Learning with Conditional   Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03047)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How to effectively perform transductive few-shot learning in the challenging and realistic scenario where the query sets are class-imbalanced (i.e., have an arbitrary and unknown distribution of samples across classes)?The key ideas and contributions are:- The paper proposes a new method called Prototypes-oriented Unbiased Transfer Model (PUTM) for class-imbalanced transductive few-shot learning. - It makes the key observation that estimating the class-wise marginal distribution of the query samples accurately is crucial for good performance on class-imbalanced datasets. - The paper pioneers the use of Conditional Transport (CT) theory to effectively model the unknown prior class distribution in the query set in a data-driven, flexible manner.- PUTM employs forward and backward navigators as transport matrices to transfer statistics between prototypes and queries, balancing between uniform and adaptive class priors.- It further derives a closed form update to refine prototypes based on the learned navigators in an iterative EM algorithm.- Experiments on four benchmarks (miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB, CIFAR-FS) show PUTM achieves superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-art on class-imbalanced few-shot learning.In summary, the key hypothesis is that modeling the unknown, imbalanced query distribution using conditional transport theory will lead to more effective prototype-based transductive few-shot learning on real-world class-imbalanced datasets. The results generally validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper appears to make the following main contributions:- It proposes a novel transductive few-shot learning method called PUTM (Prototypes-oriented Unbiased Transfer Model) for handling class-imbalanced few-shot learning scenarios. - It leverages conditional transport (CT) theory to model the unknown prior distribution of query samples in a data-driven manner. Specifically, it uses forward and backward transport matrices (navigators) optimized with a CT loss to transfer statistics from query samples to prototypes in an unbiased way. - It further derives a closed-form MAP solution to iteratively refine the prototypes based on the learned transport matrices in an EM framework. This allows transferring unbiased statistics from queries to prototypes effectively.- Extensive experiments on four benchmarks (miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB, CIFAR-FS) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PUTM model in handling both class-balanced and imbalanced few-shot learning. It achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent methods.- Ablation studies and visualization provide insights into the behavior of the learned transport matrices and prototype evolution in PUTM. The results show PUTM can adaptively capture class prior and enable robust calibration of prototypes.In summary, the key innovation is using conditional transport theory to explicitly model and leverage the unknown prior distribution in transductive few-shot learning, instead of making restrictive assumptions like uniform distribution. This allows effective unbiased transfer of statistics from queries to prototypes in class-imbalanced scenarios.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a prototypes-oriented unbiased transfer model called PUTM for class-imbalanced transductive few-shot learning that employs forward and backward navigators as transport matrices to balance the prior of query samples per class between uniform and adaptive data-driven distributions, and refines prototypes based on MAP with the learned navigators in an iterative EM-solver.
