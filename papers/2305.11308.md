# [Counterfactuals for Design: A Model-Agnostic Method For Design   Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11308)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: 

How can counterfactual search, a technique originally developed for machine learning explainability, be adapted and improved to serve as an AI-driven design recommendation tool?

The authors propose a new method called Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD) to address this question. The key hypotheses seem to be:

1) Counterfactual search can be framed as a multi-objective optimization problem to generate sets of diverse and high-quality design recommendations that meet specified performance criteria. 

2) By decoupling the optimization and sampling steps, MCD can enable rapid exploration of the counterfactual design space without retraining.

3) MCD can leverage recent advances in multi-modal learning like CLIP to support counterfactual queries using text, images, and other modalities beyond just parametric data.

4) MCD will be able to effectively handle complex multimodal queries with a combination of text, images, and parametric constraints and objectives.

Through case studies on bike frame design, the authors demonstrate MCD's capabilities for performance-driven queries, cross-modal text queries, and challenging multimodal queries. The results appear to validate their hypotheses that counterfactual search, formulated properly, can serve as an intuitive AI-driven design recommendation tool.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD), a new method for generating counterfactual design modifications to achieve desired performance outcomes. The key highlights are:

- MCD frames the counterfactual search problem as a multi-objective optimization, allowing it to generate sets of diverse and non-dominated counterfactual designs. This is an improvement over prior single-objective counterfactual methods. 

- MCD decouples the counterfactual search and sampling processes. This allows rapid sampling under different objective priorities without re-running the optimization.

- MCD supports multi-modal queries using images and text in addition to parametric data. This enables more intuitive human queries.

- Through case studies on bike frame design, the authors demonstrate MCD's ability to effectively recommend design modifications to improve performance, match subjective image and text prompts, and handle complex multimodal queries.

In summary, MCD contributes a new counterfactual search method that is tailored to design tasks, leverages multi-objective optimization, and supports multimodal queries. This enables designers to ask "what-if" questions to an AI assistant in order to iteratively improve designs.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD), a new method to generate hypothetical design modifications that improve performance across multiple objectives, enabling designers to ask "What if?" questions to optimize and understand their designs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper on Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD) compares to other related research:

- The paper builds directly on prior work in counterfactual explanations for machine learning models, especially methods like Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE) and Multi-Objective Counterfactuals (MOC). However, it presents the first application of counterfactual search to engineering design problems.

- A key distinction from prior counterfactual explanation methods is the focus on multi-objective queries and decoupling the optimization and sampling steps. This allows MCD to generate diverse sets of counterfactuals tailored to a designer's specific priorities without retraining.

- MCD is the first counterfactual method to demonstrate handling of multimodal queries, including text, images, and parameters. This cross-modal functionality is unique and enables more intuitive human queries.

- Compared to other design optimization and recommender methods, MCD provides a simple and intuitive interface for designers to pose hypothetical "what-if" scenarios. It complements simulation-based optimization and statistical recommendation methods.

- Limitations of MCD compared to gradient-based counterfactual methods include potentially lower sample efficiency and difficulty scaling to many objectives. However, it maintains model-agnosticism.

Overall, I would say this paper makes excellent progress in bringing counterfactual search to the design domain and demonstrating capabilities like multi-objective and cross-modal queries that were not shown in prior counterfactual explanation literature. The interface and visualization of tradeoffs are tailored well to design problems. This functionality seems highly promising for human-AI collaboration in design.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring MCD variants that leverage gradient information and many-objective optimization methods to address the limitations of using a gradient-free genetic algorithm approach. This could improve sample efficiency.

- Continuing to improve machine learning models for encoding technical details in text and images, which would allow more precise technical constraints to be specified through textual or visual queries rather than parametrically. 

- Applying MCD to additional real-world design problems across different industries to demonstrate its versatility and value as a design recommendation tool.

- Extending MCD to handle additional data types beyond tabular, image, and text data. For example, supporting graph-based or point cloud queries.

- Developing interactive interfaces that allow designers to intuitively explore the objective landscape and select counterfactuals that meet their precise needs.

- Incorporating causality relationships and constraints into MCD to ensure counterfactuals respect known causal links between design parameters.

- Exploring ways to quantify and minimize the cost or effort required to realize proposed counterfactuals.

- Comparing the sample efficiency and recommendation quality of MCD against other counterfactual search methods.

In summary, the authors suggest enhancements to the algorithm, expanded applications in design, support for new data types, more intuitive interfaces, incorporation of causal knowledge, and quantitative comparisons to other methods as interesting areas for future work. The paper provides a strong foundation for using counterfactual search in design that can be built upon in many directions.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD), a new method for generating counterfactual design modifications to achieve desired performance outcomes. MCD formulates the counterfactual search problem as a multi-objective optimization, with objectives to minimize the extent of modifications, encourage proximity to the original design, and satisfy user-provided performance requirements. It uses a genetic algorithm, specifically NSGA-II, to search for counterfactuals that optimize this multi-objective problem. MCD decouples the optimization and sampling steps, allowing users to sample diverse counterfactual sets under different objective priorities without re-optimization. It also supports multi-modal queries by integrating text embeddings and image embeddings from models like CLIP to handle text and image-based performance requirements. Overall, MCD provides a flexible framework to generate targeted design modifications that meet abstract, subjective, or explicit performance goals specified by the user.

 The paper is addressing the problem of how to effectively generate and recommend design modifications that achieve desired performance outcomes. Specifically, it is focused on developing a method to answer "what if?" questions that designers may have about how changing certain design attributes would impact performance. The key questions the paper seeks to address are:
