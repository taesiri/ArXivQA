# [Counterfactuals for Design: A Model-Agnostic Method For Design   Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11308)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can counterfactual search, a technique originally developed for machine learning explainability, be adapted and improved to serve as an AI-driven design recommendation tool?The authors propose a new method called Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD) to address this question. The key hypotheses seem to be:1) Counterfactual search can be framed as a multi-objective optimization problem to generate sets of diverse and high-quality design recommendations that meet specified performance criteria. 2) By decoupling the optimization and sampling steps, MCD can enable rapid exploration of the counterfactual design space without retraining.3) MCD can leverage recent advances in multi-modal learning like CLIP to support counterfactual queries using text, images, and other modalities beyond just parametric data.4) MCD will be able to effectively handle complex multimodal queries with a combination of text, images, and parametric constraints and objectives.Through case studies on bike frame design, the authors demonstrate MCD's capabilities for performance-driven queries, cross-modal text queries, and challenging multimodal queries. The results appear to validate their hypotheses that counterfactual search, formulated properly, can serve as an intuitive AI-driven design recommendation tool.
