# [Sparse and Transferable Universal Singular Vectors Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14031)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning models have shown vulnerability to small adversarial perturbations that cause misclassification. 
- Universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) are a class of attacks that can fool models on most inputs. However, existing approaches require large datasets or generative models to construct them.  
- Sparse attacks that modify few pixels are also desirable, but often have low transferability between models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new algorithm to construct sparse universal adversarial perturbations.
- The attack is based on computing truncated power iterations on the Jacobian matrices of hidden layers. This provides sparsity and transfers attack across layers.
- The method alternates between selecting top sparse components and optimizing the perturbation vector. The sparsity is gradually reduced for better convergence.

Contributions:
- The paper thoroughly evaluates the attack on ImageNet across 10 deep learning architectures.
- The attack achieves high fooling rates while modifying only 5% pixels with just 256 samples.
- It significantly outperforms prior universal perturbation methods like SVD and SGD attacks.  
- The perturbations generalize very well across models, especially for ResNets, showing high transferability.
- Detailed analyses are provided on hyperparameters like attacked layer, norm parameters, patch size, cardinality. 
- The attack patterns are analyzed and shown to be interpretable for vision transformers.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient algorithm to generate sparse and transferable universal adversarial perturbations. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and transferability for fooling deep learning models on ImageNet dataset.
