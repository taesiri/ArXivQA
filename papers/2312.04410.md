# [Smooth Diffusion: Crafting Smooth Latent Spaces in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04410)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Smooth Diffusion, a new class of high-performing diffusion models with enhanced smoothness in the latent space. The authors motivate this by showing deficiencies in existing models for downstream tasks like image interpolation, inversion, and editing. They introduce a novel Step-wise Variation Regularization loss during training that enforces smooth changes in the output image given small perturbations to the input noise. This makes the mapping robust. Quantitatively, they propose an Interpolation Standard Deviation metric to measure latent space smoothness. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on image interpolation, inversion, editing tasks validate that Smooth Diffusion manages to simultaneously improve latent smoothness and maintain high image fidelity and diversity. It outperforms strong baselines like Stable Diffusion across tasks. Smooth Diffusion is implemented via a flexible low-rank adapter module that plugins and enhances smoothness in existing models. Code and models are released to facilitate further research leveraging the desirable properties of smooth latent spaces uncovered in this work.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Smooth Diffusion: Crafting Smooth Latent Spaces in Diffusion Models":

Problem:
Recent diffusion models for text-to-image generation can occasionally produce low-quality results with undesirable behaviors. Specifically, image interpolation can result in fluctuated outputs with unpredictable changes. Image inversion may fail to reconstruct the original image faithfully. Minor text prompt editing for image editing can lead to major unintended updates. The key issue is that diffusion models have non-smooth latent spaces, where small changes in the latent space cause unpredictable large changes in the output image.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes "Smooth Diffusion", a new class of diffusion models that have smooth latent spaces. Smooth Diffusion enforces that a fixed-size perturbation on the latent code corresponds to a proportional fixed-size change in the output image. This is achieved via a new "Step-wise Variation Regularization" loss that bounds the output image variation given an input latent variation at each diffusion step.   

Main Contributions:
- Formalizes the objective of crafting smooth latent spaces in diffusion models where latent and output variations have a constant ratio.
- Proposes Step-wise Variation Regularization loss to enforce the smoothness objective during training by controlling the output variation at each diffusion step.
- Introduces Smooth Diffusion models that achieve smooth latent spaces without compromising image quality or diversity.
- Demonstrates improved performance of Smooth Diffusion over baselines in downstream tasks including image interpolation, inversion and editing.
- Provides implementation based on finetuning Stable Diffusion with a plug-and-play Smooth-LoRA module.

In summary, the paper identifies and addresses the lack of latent space smoothness in diffusion models via Smooth Diffusion. It shows both qualitatively and quantitatively that Smooth Diffusion leads to better continuity, invertibility and editability while maintaining the image generation quality. The Smooth-LoRA module makes this easily applicable to existing models.
