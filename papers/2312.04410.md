# [Smooth Diffusion: Crafting Smooth Latent Spaces in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04410)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes Smooth Diffusion, a new class of high-performing diffusion models with enhanced smoothness in the latent space. The authors motivate this by showing deficiencies in existing models for downstream tasks like image interpolation, inversion, and editing. They introduce a novel Step-wise Variation Regularization loss during training that enforces smooth changes in the output image given small perturbations to the input noise. This makes the mapping robust. Quantitatively, they propose an Interpolation Standard Deviation metric to measure latent space smoothness. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on image interpolation, inversion, editing tasks validate that Smooth Diffusion manages to simultaneously improve latent smoothness and maintain high image fidelity and diversity. It outperforms strong baselines like Stable Diffusion across tasks. Smooth Diffusion is implemented via a flexible low-rank adapter module that plugins and enhances smoothness in existing models. Code and models are released to facilitate further research leveraging the desirable properties of smooth latent spaces uncovered in this work.
