# [Resolution of Simpson's paradox via the common cause principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper addresses Simpson's paradox, which is an obstacle in establishing a probabilistic association between two binary events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given a third binary random variable $B$. 

- Simpson's paradox presents two plausible but contradictory conclusions (equations 1 and 2 in the paper) for the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$. So there are three possible outcomes - either conclusion 1 is correct, conclusion 2 is correct, or neither.

- The paper focuses on cases where there is an unobserved common cause $C$ for $B$ and the combination of $a_1$, $a_2$ and their complements $(A)$. Alternatively, $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$.

Key Ideas:
- With the introduction of $C$, Simpson's paradox now presents many options corresponding to different values of $C$, instead of just two conclusions. 

- When $A_1$, $A_2$, $B$ and $C$ are binary, the paper shows that for all possible binary $C$, the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ matches conclusion 2 of the original paradox (equations 1 and 2). 

- So if the common cause $C$ is known to be binary, conclusion 2 if the correct decision rule.

- For non-binary (e.g. tertiary) $C$, all three options of the paradox are possible. So additional information about $C$ is needed to determine the association.

Main Contributions:
- Reformulation of Simpson's paradox in terms of an unobserved common cause $C$

- Proof that for binary $C$, conclusion 2 of the original paradox is the correct decision rule

- Demonstration through examples that for non-binary $C$, all three options are possible

- Provides a pathway to potentially resolve the paradox if additional information about $C$ can be obtained

The summary covers the key problem statement, proposed probabilistic framework involving the common cause $C$, the main theoretical result for binary $C$, examples with non-binary $C$, and how it contributes to resolving the Simpson's paradox.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper resolves Simpson's paradox for binary random variables by showing that conditioning on any binary common cause establishes the same association between the target events as conditioning on the lurking variable in the original paradox formulation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is reformulating and providing a resolution to Simpson's paradox in certain cases by using the common cause principle. Specifically:

- The paper reformulates Simpson's paradox in terms of a common cause (or screening) variable C that causes the variables A=(A1,A2) and B. This allows for many possible associations between A1 and A2, with the original Simpson's paradox formulations being just two particular cases corresponding to specific choices of C. 

- For the binary case (A1, A2, B and C are all binary), the paper proves that if Simpson's paradox holds (i.e. the contradictory associations exist), then conditioning on any binary C results in the same association direction between A1 and A2 as conditioning on B. So in this minimal case, Simpson's paradox is resolved by choosing the conditioning on B formulation.

- For non-binary (e.g. tertiary) C, all three Simpson's paradox options become possible. So additional information about C is needed to resolve the paradox in such cases.

In summary, the key contribution is using the common cause principle to reformulate, generalize and provide a definitive resolution to Simpson's paradox in the binary case. The reformulation also clarifies why the paradox becomes more complicated for non-binary common causes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Simpson's paradox - The central phenomenon being studied, where aggregated data shows one conclusion about an association between two binary events, but conditioning on a third binary variable flip the association in the opposite direction.

- Common cause principle - The idea that if two events are correlated, there may be an unobserved "common cause" variable that explains the correlation, rather than a direct causal relationship. This is a key concept used to reformulate Simpson's paradox.

- Binary variables - The paper focuses specifically on the case where the variables involved in Simpson's paradox (the two events and the third lurking variable) are all binary. This allows stronger conclusions to be reached.

- Conditioning - An important probabilistic concept, referring to looking at conditional probabilities like P(A|B). Different conditioning gives the contradictory conclusions in Simpson's paradox.

- Time ordering - The paper considers cases where the variables have a definite time ordering, with the common cause preceding the other variables. This connects to ideas of causality.

- Screening - The idea that a variable can causally influence one variable while "screening" it from another, so they become conditionally independent.

So in summary, key terms cover Simpson's paradox itself, the common cause principle, binary variables, conditioning, time ordering of variables, and causal concepts like screening.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a common cause variable C to help resolve Simpson's paradox. What are some ways one could infer or estimate this unobserved variable C from the available data? What assumptions would be needed?

2. The theorem in the paper shows that for binary variables, all common causes C predict the same association between a1 and a2. Does this result generalize for non-binary C? Under what conditions?

3. How does the screening property assumed between variables A, B and C mathematically relate to causal graphs and d-separation? Can the results be extended to more complex graph structures?

4. The paper focuses on discrete random variables. Could the common cause formulation help resolve versions of Simpson's paradox that involve continuous variables? What modifications would be needed? 

5. What practical methods could help identify whether a given dataset allows for a binary common cause explanation? Are there any statistical tests or model selection approaches that could be proposed?

6. The introduction of C technically expands the paradox to more options beyond the original two. Does this expanded paradox require new mathematical tools to analyze beyond the binary setting?

7. The paper argues C provides the correct way to assess probabilistic association between a1 and a2. What philosophical assumptions underlie this claim? How could they be tested?

8. The literature often discusses exchangeability and causality-based resolutions to Simpson's. How does formally introducing C compare to those approaches theoretically and interpretatively?

9. What real-world examples best illustrate the power of a common cause explanation? Are there any famous instances of Simpson's paradox that can be reexamined with this lens?

10. How does the possibility of an unobserved common cause C impact regulatory or legal decision making that involves reasoning with probabilistic data in the face of Simpson's situations? Could formalizing C provide guidance in such situations?
