# [Resolution of Simpson's paradox via the common cause principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00957)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper addresses Simpson's paradox, which is an obstacle in establishing a probabilistic association between two binary events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given a third binary random variable $B$. 

- Simpson's paradox presents two plausible but contradictory conclusions (equations 1 and 2 in the paper) for the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$. So there are three possible outcomes - either conclusion 1 is correct, conclusion 2 is correct, or neither.

- The paper focuses on cases where there is an unobserved common cause $C$ for $B$ and the combination of $a_1$, $a_2$ and their complements $(A)$. Alternatively, $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$.

Key Ideas:
- With the introduction of $C$, Simpson's paradox now presents many options corresponding to different values of $C$, instead of just two conclusions. 

- When $A_1$, $A_2$, $B$ and $C$ are binary, the paper shows that for all possible binary $C$, the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ matches conclusion 2 of the original paradox (equations 1 and 2). 

- So if the common cause $C$ is known to be binary, conclusion 2 if the correct decision rule.

- For non-binary (e.g. tertiary) $C$, all three options of the paradox are possible. So additional information about $C$ is needed to determine the association.

Main Contributions:
- Reformulation of Simpson's paradox in terms of an unobserved common cause $C$

- Proof that for binary $C$, conclusion 2 of the original paradox is the correct decision rule

- Demonstration through examples that for non-binary $C$, all three options are possible

- Provides a pathway to potentially resolve the paradox if additional information about $C$ can be obtained

The summary covers the key problem statement, proposed probabilistic framework involving the common cause $C$, the main theoretical result for binary $C$, examples with non-binary $C$, and how it contributes to resolving the Simpson's paradox.
