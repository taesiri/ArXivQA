# [Nomic Embed: Training a Reproducible Long Context Text Embedder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01613)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Most top performing text embedding models are closed-source, limited to 512 token contexts, and lack end-to-end auditability. 
- Existing open-source models with long contexts do not exceed the performance of proprietary models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada.
- There is a need for a high-quality open-source text embedding model with long context that matches or exceeds current proprietary models.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors train nomic-embed-text-v1, an open-source 137M parameter text embedding model that handles 8192 token contexts.
- They use a BERT-style architecture with modifications like rotary embeddings and Flash Attention to enable the long context. 
- The model is trained in three stages: masked language model pretraining, unsupervised contrastive pretraining, and supervised contrastive finetuning. 
- A dataset of 235M filtered text pairs across 29 sources is used for contrastive pretraining.

Main Contributions:
- nomic-embed-text-v1 outperforms OpenAI's text-embedding-ada and text-embedding-3-small on both short and long context benchmarks.
- It is the first fully open-source, auditible long context model to exceed proprietary model performance.
- The authors release the code, model weights, and full training data to enable reproducibility.
- With the resources provided, the model can be fully replicated in approximately 1 week on a single 8xH100 node.

In summary, this paper presents a major step forward for open-source NLP by providing an reproducible long context text embedding model that meets or exceeds current proprietary solutions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper describes the training of nomic-embed-text-v1, an open-source long context text embedding model with full replication code and data that outperforms OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 and text-embedding-3-small on both short and long context benchmarks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The release of nomic-embed-text-v1, the first fully open-source long context text embedding model that surpasses OpenAI Ada-002 performance on both short and long context benchmarks. Key features of this model include:

- It is a 137M parameter model with an 8192 context length
- The full training code, model weights, and curated training data are released under an Apache 2 license to enable end-to-end auditability and replication 
- It outperforms OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 and text-embedding-3-small on benchmarks like MTEB, Jina Long Context, and LoCo
- It is the only 100M parameter class open-source model that exceeds the performance of OpenAI's models on both short and long context tasks

So in summary, the key contribution is an open-source long context embedding model that matches or exceeds proprietary models from OpenAI, enabled through accessible training code, weights and datasets. This increases transparency and auditability compared to closed-source alternatives.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Text embeddings - The paper focuses on training and evaluating text embedding models which encode semantic information about sentences/documents into low-dimensional vectors.

- Long context models - A key focus is developing models that can handle long input sequences (up to 8192 tokens), overcoming limitations of shorter context models.

- Reproducibility - The paper emphasizes releasing code, model weights, and curated training data to enable full replication of their nomic-embed-text-v1 model.

- Benchmarking - The model is evaluated extensively on standard benchmarks like GLUE and MTEB as well as long context specific tests like the JinaAI and LoCo benchmarks.

- Model architecture - Details are provided on optimizations like rotary embeddings and Flash Attention to enable training longer sequence models based on BERT.

- Training methodology - The multi-stage training process is described including masked LM pretraining, unsupervised contrastive pretraining, and supervised contrastive finetuning.

- Performance - The nomic-embed-text-v1 model is shown to exceed the performance of OpenAI's text-embedding-ada and other models on both short and long context tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using dynamic NTK interpolation to scale the model to 8192 sequence length during inference. Can you explain in more detail how this technique works and why it was chosen over other methods? 

2. Unsupervised pretraining uses a dataset of 235 million filtered text pairs. What considerations went into the filtering process and how was consistency filtering using the gte-base model implemented?

3. The model incorporates several architectural changes to BERT base to accommodate longer sequences, including rotary embeddings and Flash Attention. Why were these specific modifications chosen and what benefits did they provide? 

4. During unsupervised pretraining, you employ a very large batch size of 16,384 to provide more in-batch negatives. What modifications or optimizations were made to enable training with this large batch size?

5. The supervised fine-tuning stage uses 7 hard negatives per pair. How do you generate hard negatives for a given text pair and why 7 specifically? What was the process for determining this hyperparameter?

6. The model is evaluated on the MTEB, Jina Long Context, and LoCo benchmarks. Why were these specific benchmarks chosen and what unique strengths does each one have for evaluating long context models? 

7. Ablation studies show that omitting the FEVER, HotpotQA and MEDI datasets decreases MTEB scores slightly. Why do you think these specific datasets provided a benefit? 

8. How were the task-specific prefixes (e.g. search_query, search_document) devised? What considerations went into balancing symmetric vs asymmetric tasks with the prefixes?

9. The model achieves very high performance on the QASP Abstract Articles task, approaching 99% on some models. Why do you think the models oversaturate on this specific dataset?

10. If compute or memory resources were unlimited, what modifications or scaling up would you prioritize to further improve the model's capabilities?
