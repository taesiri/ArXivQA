# [Computational Semantics and Evaluation Benchmark for Interrogative   Sentences via Combinatory Categorial Grammar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of research on interrogative sentences within the framework of Categorial Grammar. Also, there is a gap between the semantic parsing literature and theoretical investigations into the syntax-semantics interface of questions.
- No existing benchmark evaluates the syntax-semantics interface for a wide range of question types.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a compositional analysis that maps different types of questions (polar, wh-questions) to logical semantic representations using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).  
- Introduce a new benchmark dataset called QSEM for evaluating the syntax-semantics interface for questions. The dataset has 138 question-answer pairs covering phenomena like quantifiers, scope, etc.
- Implement the analysis using a system called ccg2hol that utilizes existing CCG parsers and theorem provers. Used this system to annotate 49.3% of QSEM dataset with CCG derivations and semantic representations.

Main Contributions:
1) Compositional analysis of questions within CCG
2) QSEM benchmark for evaluating question semantics 
3) Partial semantic annotation of QSEM using ccg2hol system
4) Qualitative analysis of limitations of standard CCG parsers

The ultimate goal is for ccg2hol to be an analysis-independent computational framework for semantic composition and inference. Future work includes extending analysis to other languages, fixing issues in CCG parsing, refining semantic tag design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a compositional semantics and benchmark for analyzing the syntax-semantics interface of various types of interrogative sentences within Combinatory Categorial Grammar, including the introduction of a new question-answering dataset QSEM and an implementation system ccg2hol.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting a compositional analysis that maps various types of interrogative sentences to logical semantic representations within the framework of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).

2. Introducing a FraCaS-inspired benchmark dataset QSEM for evaluating the syntax-semantics interface for various types of interrogative sentences. 

3. Reporting on a semantic annotation project which assigns each sentence in QSEM with a gold CCG tree and a logical semantic representation using their system ccg2hol.

4. Performing a qualitative analysis of the output from standard CCG parsers.

In summary, the key contributions are: (1) the compositional semantics analysis, (2) the new QSEM dataset, (3) semantic annotations using the ccg2hol system, and (4) analysis of CCG parsers. The establishment of the ccg2hol system to make theoretical linguistics computationally implementable is stated as the prioritized goal.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called QSEM for evaluating the semantics of interrogative sentences. What are some of the key limitations of existing datasets that QSEM aims to address? How does the construction of QSEM examples differ from existing datasets?

2. The paper utilizes a pipeline involving CCG parsing, semantic composition, and theorem proving for question answering. What are some potential challenges or error sources when using existing CCG parsers trained on declarative sentences for interrogative sentences? 

3. The lexical entries proposed for "be" and "do" in Table 1 seem to handle various syntactic contexts. How might the analysis need to be extended to properly cover additional complex constructions involving "be" and "do"?

4. For argument wh-questions, why is the Skolem term F2 used in the denotation of "who" in Table 2? What role does it play compositionally and how does it interact with Quantifier Closure?

5. The definitions given for "?" and "Q" operators in Section 3.1 seem simple but can be modified to capture different theoretical perspectives. Discuss two alternative definitions and how they would change the semantic representations. 

6. In the CCG derivation in Figure 2, at what point is the "?" operator introduced compositionally? Could this step potentially be associated with different lexical items depending on the analysis?

7. The paper utilizes intuitionistic logic as the underlying logic system. What were the motivations behind this choice? What are some advantages and disadvantages compared to classical logic?

8. The qualitative error analysis in Section 5.2 identifies some consistent errors in existing CCG parsers. Propose one or two potential solutions that could address these systematic errors.  

9. The use of Higher-Order Logic (HOL) representations aims to keep the system independent of specific semantic theories. How easy or difficult is it to convert HOL to different target representations?

10. About half of the QSEM dataset has been annotated with gold CCG derivations and semantic representations so far. What are some priorities for expanding the annotation coverage and quality?
