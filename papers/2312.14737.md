# [Computational Semantics and Evaluation Benchmark for Interrogative   Sentences via Combinatory Categorial Grammar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14737)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of research on interrogative sentences within the framework of Categorial Grammar. Also, there is a gap between the semantic parsing literature and theoretical investigations into the syntax-semantics interface of questions.
- No existing benchmark evaluates the syntax-semantics interface for a wide range of question types.

Proposed Solution:
- Present a compositional analysis that maps different types of questions (polar, wh-questions) to logical semantic representations using Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).  
- Introduce a new benchmark dataset called QSEM for evaluating the syntax-semantics interface for questions. The dataset has 138 question-answer pairs covering phenomena like quantifiers, scope, etc.
- Implement the analysis using a system called ccg2hol that utilizes existing CCG parsers and theorem provers. Used this system to annotate 49.3% of QSEM dataset with CCG derivations and semantic representations.

Main Contributions:
1) Compositional analysis of questions within CCG
2) QSEM benchmark for evaluating question semantics 
3) Partial semantic annotation of QSEM using ccg2hol system
4) Qualitative analysis of limitations of standard CCG parsers

The ultimate goal is for ccg2hol to be an analysis-independent computational framework for semantic composition and inference. Future work includes extending analysis to other languages, fixing issues in CCG parsing, refining semantic tag design.
