# [Self-training from Self-memory in Data-to-text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Data-to-text generation (DTG) involves converting structured data such as tables or meaning representations into fluent natural language text. Current approaches rely on large neural models that require massive compute resources. 
- The paper explores optimization strategies for self-training in DTG to maintain model performance comparable to full-data training while reducing the volume of training data required.

Method:
- The paper proposes a novel self-training framework called Self-Training from Self-Memory (STSM).
- It uses two models - data-to-text (D2T) and text-to-data (T2D). D2T generates text from data while T2D converts text back to data.
- A subset of training data is used to train initial D2T and T2D models. These models are then used to infer "self-memory" outputs on another subset.
- The T2D model validates quality of D2T outputs by converting them back to data. A greedy optimization algorithm generates shorter D2T outputs containing all input values.
- Valid D2T-T2D output pairs are used as "new data" to retrain the models. The process repeats for several epochs.

Contributions:
- Proposes the STSM model that incorporates self-memory and/or new data for self-training DTG models, helping maintain performance of smaller models closer to full-data training.
- Provides a method to generate shorter valid D2T outputs containing all input values using optimization and T2D validation.
- Shows combining self-memory and new data to self-train only the D2T model, without T2D self-training, works best.
- Reduces volume of training data needed to train a competitive DTG model.
- Could help with continual learning when new data is incrementally added for training.

Experiments:
- Evaluated on DART and E2E-NLG datasets using METEOR, BLEU scores.
- Self-training with 30% training data achieves competitive performance compared to full-data training of baseline Transformer models.

Limitations and future work are also discussed.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a novel self-training model for data-to-text generation that uses self-memory and newly acquired data to train the model on subsets while maintaining performance competitive with full data training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Introduction of a novel training model called STSM (Self-training from Self-memory) designed for data-to-text generation tasks. This model incorporates self-memory and/or newly acquired data to self-train data-to-text (D2T) and text-to-data (T2D) models.

2. A process for creating self-training data by selecting source-target pairs inferred from the D2T and T2D models based on pre-defined criteria. Different combinations of self-memory and/or new data are then used to create subsets for self-training.

The key idea is to use less training data in each epoch while maintaining performance levels comparable to full training data by leveraging self-memory and new data. Experiments on two datasets show the model can achieve competitive results to full training while using only 30% of training data per epoch.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, the keywords or key terms associated with this paper appear to be:

Natural Language Generation, Data-to-text Generation, Self-training, Self-memory

The paper introduces a novel training model called "Self-training from Self-memory" (STSM) for data-to-text generation tasks. The key ideas explored are using self-training on subsets of data that include self-memory from model outputs, as well as incorporating new data, to maintain performance comparable to full data training while reducing the amount of training data needed. The method is evaluated on two data-to-text datasets - E2E NLG and DART. So the key terms reflect this focus - natural language generation, specifically data-to-text generation, the use of self-training, and the concept of self-memory from model outputs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a novel self-training framework called STSM. Can you explain in detail the key components and steps involved in STSM? What are the roles of the D2T and T2D models in this framework?

2. The paper mentions using a greedy algorithm for target optimization to generate shorter outputs that contain all source values. Can you describe this algorithm, its inputs and outputs, and how it works to optimize targets? 

3. What are the specific criteria and conditions used to filter "elite" source-target pairs from the tuple data (X, Y, Y', X', Y'', X'') to create new training data? Explain each in detail. 

4. What is the purpose of using the T2D model in the proposed framework? How does it help validate relationships captured in the D2T outputs and contribute to improving overall output quality?

5. The optimized self-training method is identified as "self-mem + new data" without self-training the T2D model. Can you analyze why self-training the T2D model does not significantly improve performance?

6. When creating new training subsets, different strategies are mentioned for mixing self-memory and original or new data. What are some example strategies and what factors need to be considered when determining mix ratios?

7. The paperexperimented on two datasets - E2E NLG and DART. Can you compare and analyze the key differences between these datasets and why they were chosen to evaluate the proposed method? 

8. What are the limitations acknowledged with the experiments and evaluations conducted in this study? What further analyses or additional datasets could address these limitations? 

9. The paper mentions the potential for using self-memory with external data from models like ChatGPT. Can you suggest ways to integrate such external data with self-memory for self-training Text-to-Text models? 

10. One limitation mentioned is the lack of analysis on training times. What experiments could be set up to compare training times across full training methods versus self-training methods? What factors may influence differences in training times?
