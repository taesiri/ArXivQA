# [Chain-of-Interaction: Enhancing Large Language Models for Psychiatric   Behavior Understanding by Dyadic Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13786)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automating the coding of patient behaviors in motivational interviewing (MI) sessions is necessary to support clinician decision-making and training. However, existing machine learning methods lack incorporation of domain knowledge from the MISC coding schema used by human experts.  
- They also overlook the dyadic interactions between therapists and patients which provide important context.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new prompting method called "Chain-of-Interaction" (CoI) to enhance large language models (LLMs) for the behavioral coding task. 
- It breaks down the task into 3 reasoning stages:
   1) Interaction Definition: Provides background on MISC codes to the LLM
   2) Involvement Assessment: Assesses patient engagement clues  
   3) Valence Analysis: Analyzes patient sentiment and previous outputs to determine utterance valence
- By structuring the task to leverage both domain knowledge and patient-therapist interactions, the CoI method aims to simulate human-expert coding process.

Experiments and Results:
- Experiments conducted on real alcohol addiction counseling sessions with 4 LLMs - Llama2, Falcon, Mistral, ChatGPT.
- The CoI prompting method consistently outperforms baselines like Zero-shot, Few-shot and ZeroCoT prompting techniques.  
- Ablation studies demonstrate each CoI stage's contribution, with performance worsening when any stage is removed.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new prompting technique specifically tailored for the MI behavioral coding task by incorporating domain knowledge and dyadic interactions.
- Systematically structures the complex task to match human-expert reasoning process.
- Experiments show consistent state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines across multiple advanced LLMs.
- Ablation studies validate the value added by each stage of the Chain-of-Interaction prompting method.
