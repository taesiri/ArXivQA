# [Counterfactual Reasoning with Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06936)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Counterfactual reasoning (reasoning about hypothetical situations) is important for game theory, free will, etc. but has not been explored for knowledge graphs (KGs) and knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). 
- KGs explicitly represent factual knowledge of the world through triples like (Paris, capital of, France). KGEs can effectively infer new plausible triples by learning patterns in KGs.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors link KG completion and counterfactual reasoning by proposing a new task called Counterfactual KG Reasoning (CFKGR).
- In CFKGR, the original KG represents the real world state. Hypothetical scenarios are introduced by adding new triples to the KG. Models must identify plausible changes to the KG induced by the scenario, while retaining existing knowledge. 
- CFKGR datasets are created based on composition rules mined from KGs, which produce local changes. The datasets have diverse scenarios and associated test cases - inferences, unchanged facts, etc.
- A new method called COULDD is proposed to adapt existing KGE models for counterfactual KGs by fine-tuning them towards classifying the scenario as valid, without requiring explicit information about the rules.

Main Contributions:
- Proposal of CFKGR, a novel task connecting KG completion and counterfactual reasoning.
- Creation of corresponding benchmark datasets with automated and human-verified labels.
- Introduction of COULDD for counterfactual inference with KGEs. Experiments show improvements over KGEs and that they learn prominent patterns but struggle on non-rule based changes.
- Analysis and comparison to ChatGPT, which better handles non-rule based cases but shows poor knowledge retention.

In summary, the paper links two distinct research areas via the new task CFKGR and accompanying benchmark datasets and introduces COULDD as a way to harness KGEs for counterfactual reasoning on KGs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new task called Counterfactual Knowledge Graph Reasoning (CFKGR) which requires models to make plausible inferences on a hypothetical knowledge graph created by adding new facts, links emerging facts through logical rules to knowledge graph completion, creates benchmark datasets, and evaluates performance of knowledge graph embeddings adapted using a proposed method COULDD against ChatGPT.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new task called Counterfactual Knowledge Graph Reasoning (CFKGR) which requires models to reason about hypothetical scenarios expressed as changes to a knowledge graph. They create corresponding benchmark datasets based on the CoDEx benchmark.

2) Introducing COULDD, a general method to adapt existing knowledge graph embedding models to make inferences in counterfactual knowledge graphs by fine-tuning the embeddings on the hypothetical scenarios.

3) Comparing counterfactual reasoning capabilities of knowledge graph embeddings adapted with COULDD to the ChatGPT model. The results indicate that ChatGPT is better at detecting plausible counterfactual inferences but struggles to retain unaffected factual knowledge compared to COULDD.

In summary, the paper connects knowledge graph completion and counterfactual reasoning by formulating counterfactuals as changes to knowledge graphs. It provides new datasets, proposes a method for counterfactual reasoning with KGEs, and analyzes the reasoning abilities of KGEs and ChatGPT on the new task.

The paper introduces a new task called "Counterfactual Knowledge Graph Reasoning" (CFKGR) which requires models to reason about hypothetical changes made to a knowledge graph. It creates corresponding benchmark datasets and proposes an approach called COULDD to adapt existing KGE models to perform counterfactual inferences on knowledge graphs. The performance of COULDD and ChatGPT is analyzed on the datasets, including a human annotation study.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does COULDD balance adapting the knowledge graph embeddings to correctly incorporate the hypothetical scenario while avoiding excessive perturbations to the pre-trained embeddings? What measures are taken to prevent overfitting?

2. The paper claims COULDD requires no task-specific training data or information about the rules used to generate the CFKGR datasets. However, the learning rate and number of additional samples are tuned on a validation set. Does this violate the claim of being rule-agnostic? How could COULDD be adapted to be truly rule-agnostic? 

3. What are some potential ways the negative sampling strategy used during COULDD training could be improved? For example, could we sample more intelligently based on entity types or relation domains and ranges? 

4. Could COULDD be extended to adversarial training schemes that intentionally sample challenging negative examples? Would this improve robustness on unseen counterfactual scenarios?

5. The paper identifies predicting false inferences that follow plausible patterns in the KG as a key challenge. How could COULDD be adapted to better discriminate between human-plausible and implausible inferences?

6. Error analysis reveals COULDD struggles to identify outdated facts in counterfactual scenarios. What modifications could address this limitation?

7. How suitable is COULDD for unseen relations that were not present during pre-training? Could additional techniques likemeta-learning or few-shot learning help improve generalization?  

8. The fixed threshold for early stopping likely varies across rules and scenarios. How could it be set more adaptively to avoid under- or over-updating?

9. What contextual information is COULDD lacking compared to humans that limits its counterfactual reasoning abilities? How can we quantify this gap?

10. The paper focuses on compositional rules. What types of non-compositional rules would be most valuable to consider next for expanding the scope and difficulty of CFKGR?
