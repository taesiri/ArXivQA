# [Leveraging Large Language Models for Analyzing Blood Pressure Variations   Across Biological Sex from Scientific Literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01826)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract blood pressure (BP) statistics from scientific literature based on biological sex. The motivation is that existing BP measurement standards may be biased as they do not consider factors like demographics. However, manually analyzing the extensive BP literature is infeasible. 

The authors employ the GPT-3.5-turbo LLM in a zero-shot setting to extract the mean and standard deviation of BP for males and females from 25 million PubMed abstracts. They refine the dataset to target relevant abstracts containing BP values in mmHg units. The LLM is prompted to extract values for 10 variables related to BP and biological sex from each abstract. 

993 abstracts met the criteria and had LLM-extracted values for all variables. Analysis of the extracted information shows males exhibit higher BP than females, aligning with previous findings. When abstracts contained all variables, the LLM predicted them accurately. However, the LLM sometimes made unsupported predictions when abstracts lacked variables, indicating a tendency to "hallucinate" values.

In summary, the key contributions are: 1) Showing the viability of using LLMs to automatically analyze scientific literature and extract demographic-specific BP statistics; 2) Demonstrating the ability to conduct large-scale BP variation analysis across biological sex, which would be infeasible manually; 3) Highlighting promising accuracy but also propensity for hallucination issues when using LLMs in a zero-shot information extraction setting. The authors suggest refinements to the prompting strategy could help address these limitations in the future.
