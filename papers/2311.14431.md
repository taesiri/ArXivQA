# [What you need to know about a learning robot: Identifying the enabling   architecture of complex systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14431)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a structured 4-step approach to identify the "enabling architecture" and corresponding "explanandum" of a complex system like a robot learning algorithm. The enabling architecture refers to the aspects of the system architecture that a lay user would need to understand to effectively interact with the system. The explanandum is the part of the enabling architecture that the user is actually missing or misunderstanding, which should be the target of explanations. The four steps are: (1) Interview experts to get explanations of the system architecture, (2) Reduce the architecture explanation using systematic analysis like creating a concept map, (3) Assess lay users' mental models of the system through interviews, (4) Synthesize the expert and user concepts to identify misunderstandings and missing information = the explanandum. The authors illustrate this process on a robot learning algorithm, getting expert explanations, analyzing them to identify key concepts, then interviewing lay users after they interact with the robot, identifying gaps in understanding. They classify concepts into known info, misunderstandings, missing info and irrelevant info. The misunderstandings and missing info make up the explanandum to be explained. The approach provides a structured way to identify what needs explaining in complex AI systems like robot learning algorithms.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a four-step approach to identify the key aspects of a complex system's architecture that need to be explained to users to enable effective interaction, as well as the misunderstandings and missing concepts in the users' mental models of the system.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is presenting a structured four-step approach to identify the "enabling architecture" and corresponding "explanandum" of a complex system like a robot learning algorithm. Specifically:

1) The paper proposes using concepts from didactic reconstruction and reduction to systematically determine the key aspects of a complex system architecture that are needed to enable effective use by lay users. This is called the "enabling architecture".

2) It presents a method to assess lay users' mental models and identify misunderstandings or missing concepts related to the enabling architecture. This is termed the "explanandum". 

3) The paper demonstrates applying this four-step approach - expert study, architecture reduction, user study, synthesis - to identify the enabling architecture and explanandum for an example robot learning algorithm.

4) It discusses how the identified explanandum consisting of misunderstandings and missing concepts can serve as the basis for targeted explanations to improve lay users' mental models and interaction with the system.

In summary, the key contribution is a structured approach to identify the key concepts that need explanation for effective human-AI interaction by systematically comparing experts' and users' perspectives. The paper demonstrates its application on a robot learning algorithm example.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- robotics
- HRI (human-robot interaction)  
- explainability
- didactics
- didactic reconstruction
- mental models
- interactive task learning
- explanandum
- enabling architecture
- expert study
- lay user study
- synthesis
- misunderstandings
- missing information

The paper presents an approach for identifying an "enabling architecture" and corresponding "explanandum" for complex technologies like robots. The enabling architecture refers to those aspects of a system that might need to be explained to a user to enable effective use. The explanandum refers to misunderstandings or missing concepts related to this architecture that need to be clarified. 

The approach draws on concepts from didactics like didactic reconstruction and didactic reduction. It involves conducting an expert study to identify the architecture, a lay user study to assess mental models, and synthesizing these to determine the explanandum. The paper applies this approach to an example robot learning algorithm.

Keywords reflect things like the field (robotics, HRI), concepts used from other fields (didactics, mental models), the specific approach proposed (enabling architecture, explanandum), and the studies conducted. The core focus seems to be on supporting explainability for interactive robot learning through a structured analysis of expert and user knowledge.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using didactic reconstruction and reduction as the foundation of the approach. Can you expand more on why these specific methods were selected and how they enable identifying the enabling architecture and explanandum?

2. In the factual situation expert study, how were the experts selected and what criteria were used to determine their expertise level? Were any steps taken to reduce potential biases in the expert explanations? 

3. The paper states that the raw expert explanations were still too complex for lay users. What specific analysis was done to support this conclusion? Were the full expert explanations evaluated in any way before moving to the reduction step?

4. In the architecture reduction section, several analysis and post-processing steps are described. Can you expand on the rationale and goals of each step? Were any quantitative metrics tracked through the process to validate the effectiveness of the reduction?

5. For the pupil's mental model study, what considerations went into the study and interview design? How was it ensured that user's explanations reflected concepts related to the architecture versus other factors? 

6. In the synthesis section, the diagram depicts different areas of knowledge. Can you walk through the meaning and significance of each area and how they were identified from the study data?

7. Were there any challenges or limitations faced in applying didactic reconstruction and reduction to this problem space? What modifications were made to tailor the methods?

8. The future work section mentions determining the influence of modalities on mental models. What preliminary hypotheses exist here and how might you test them?  

9. Beyond modalities, what other factors may influence the enabling architecture and explanandum? How might the method be expanded to account for these?

10. To scale up the approach, automation of steps is mentioned. What are the most critical pieces to automate first and why? What methods could be leveraged?
