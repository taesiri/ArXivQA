# [PlaneRecTR: Unified Query Learning for 3D Plane Recovery from a Single   View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13756)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis seems to be:Whether unifying all subtasks related to single-view plane recovery (plane detection, segmentation, parameter estimation, depth estimation) into a single compact model can achieve better performance compared to treating these subtasks separately. The key motivation and hypothesis stated in the introduction is that existing methods tend to divide the plane recovery task into separate subtasks and solve them sequentially. However, the authors suspect this is a potential performance limitation, and propose that jointly modeling all the subtasks in a unified framework could lead to mutual benefits and improved overall performance.Specifically, the paper proposes PlaneRecTR, a Transformer-based architecture to jointly model plane detection, segmentation, parameters and depth in a unified query learning framework. Through experiments on ScanNet and NYUv2-Plane datasets, they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to prior CNN and Transformer baselines, validating their hypothesis that unifying the subtasks is beneficial.In summary, the central research question is whether a unified model for all plane recovery subtasks can outperform separating them, and the key hypothesis is that modeling them jointly enables mutual benefits and higher overall performance. PlaneRecTR is proposed to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes PlaneRecTR, the first unified framework for single-view 3D plane recovery that jointly handles multiple subtasks like plane detection, segmentation, parameter estimation and depth prediction in a single model. 2. The core of PlaneRecTR is the use of unified query learning via a Transformer architecture to enable joint modeling and reasoning between the plane-related subtasks. This is shown to achieve mutual benefits across tasks and obtain state-of-the-art performance.3. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and NYUv2-Plane datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the unified modeling approach. PlaneRecTR outperforms previous CNN and Transformer baselines by a significant margin.4. Ablation studies validate the design choices like joint prediction of plane parameters, masks and depths which enable the multi-task reasoning. The framework is also shown to benefit from stronger backbone models.5. Overall, the key novelty is the query-based unified modeling for the first time in single-view plane recovery, which removes the need for separate networks or post-processing steps. The joint reasoning achieves new state-of-the-art results while using a compact model.In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of a unified Transformer-based framework PlaneRecTR that can jointly perform multiple plane recovery subtasks via query learning and achieves superior performance compared to prior works.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes PlaneRecTR, a Transformer-based architecture that unifies multiple subtasks related to single-view plane recovery including plane detection, segmentation, parameter estimation, and depth prediction into a single model to achieve mutual benefits across tasks and obtain state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNet and NYUv2 datasets.
