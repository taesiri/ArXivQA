# [DTS-SQL: Decomposed Text-to-SQL with Small Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01117)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Leading text-to-SQL models rely heavily on large proprietary language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5-turbo, raising concerns over data privacy and cost.  
- Smaller open-source LLMs fine-tuned on question-SQL pairs lag behind proprietary models in performance. For example, the best open-source LLM reaches 63.9% execution accuracy on Spider dev set, while a prompting method with GPT-4 achieves 74.4%.

Proposed Solution:
- A two-stage fine-tuning approach called Decomposed Text-to-SQL (DTS-SQL) that separates the text-to-SQL task into schema linking and SQL generation components.
- Stage 1 fine-tunes an LLM to identify relevant tables and columns for a given natural language question. 
- Stage 2 fine-tunes a separate LLM to generate the SQL query based only on the question and schemas of the relevant tables from stage 1.

Main Contributions:
- DTS-SQL aligns the performance of 7B parameter open-source LLMs with proprietary 175B parameter models, reaching 79.1% execution accuracy on Spider dev set.
- With DeepSeek, DTS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source methods on Spider dev set and is comparable to the best open-source method on Spider test set.
- DTS-SQL generalizes well to the Spider-SYN cross-domain dataset, despite not being directly fine-tuned on it.
- By decomposing text-to-SQL into two stages, DTS-SQL allows smaller LLMs to rival much larger proprietary models, helping mitigate privacy and cost concerns.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel two-stage fine-tuning approach called DTS-SQL that decomposes the text-to-SQL task into schema linking and SQL generation subtasks, demonstrating improved performance with small open-source language models that rivals large proprietary models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is introducing a novel two-stage fine-tuning approach called "Decomposed Text-to-SQL" (DTS-SQL) that decomposes the text-to-SQL task into two simpler sub-tasks - schema linking and SQL generation. This approach aims to improve the performance of small open-source language models on text-to-SQL benchmarks to be comparable to large proprietary models. Specifically:

- They propose explicitly fine-tuning models for schema linking to identify relevant tables/columns first, before fine-tuning for SQL generation using only the identified relevant schema. This decomposition allows more focused training on each sub-task.

- They show through experiments on Spider and Spider-SYN benchmarks that their approach leads to 3-7% better execution accuracy compared to conventional one-stage fine-tuning. 

- Using a 7B parameter model, their approach achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source methods on Spider dev set, and results comparable to prompting methods with GPT-4 on Spider test set.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating a novel two-stage fine-tuning approach for text-to-SQL that helps small open-source LLMs rival the performance of large proprietary models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning approach that first fine-tunes a model for schema linking and then fine-tunes another model for SQL generation. Why is decomposing the text-to-SQL task into these two stages beneficial compared to end-to-end fine-tuning? What are the limitations of end-to-end fine-tuning that this addresses?

2. The schema linking model is trained to predict the relevant tables and columns given a natural language question. What type of input representation and output format does the schema linking model use during training and inference? How does the output of the schema linker get incorporated into the SQL generator?

3. The paper shows that providing the ground truth tables to the SQL generator (upper bound performance) leads to a significant boost in accuracy. What techniques could be used to improve the schema linker to close this performance gap? Have retrieval-based methods or in-context learning been explored for schema linking? 

4. How exactly were the DeepSeek and Mistral models pretrained? What architectural differences exist between them and how might those impact their effectiveness for tasks like text-to-SQL?

5. The paper evaluated on Spider and Spider-SYN datasets. What core differences exist between these two datasets in terms of language and schema complexity? How does model performance compare across the two?

6. What validation techniques were used during model development to identify optimal hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate? Were methods like k-fold cross validation used?

7. How was overfitting addressed during the fine-tuning process? Were regularization techniques like dropout used? Were the number of fine-tuning epochs optimized to prevent overfitting?

8. The code and models are open-sourced to enable reproducibility. What are the key implementation challenges someone may face if attempting to reproduce these results? How could the artifacts be improved to make reproducibility easier?

9. What ideas for future work are mentioned in the paper? What are other promising research directions that could build on this work? Are there opportunities to enhance both the schema linking and SQL generation stages independently?

10. From an NLP perspective, what makes text-to-SQL challenging compared to other text generation tasks? How do factors like reasoning over structured data and capturing schema information increase the complexity?
