# [3D Motion Magnification: Visualizing Subtle Motions with Time Varying   Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03757)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we extend video motion magnification techniques to model and visualize subtle motions in 3D scenes?Specifically, the paper proposes a method for 3D motion magnification that leverages neural radiance fields (NeRF) as the 3D scene representation. The key ideas are:- Model subtle 3D motions over time by modifying only the point embedding function in NeRF, while keeping the MLP network fixed. This allows capturing subtle variations through changes in the embeddings. - Apply principles from Eulerian video magnification (analyzing temporal pixel variations) to the analysis of temporal variations in NeRF embeddings. This allows extending 2D magnification techniques like linear and phase-based magnification to operate on the NeRF embeddings.- Compare positional encoding versus tri-plane based embeddings for NeRF in the context of 3D motion magnification. The tri-plane formulation provides a natural way to apply 2D magnification techniques on the feature planes.- Demonstrate 3D motion magnification results on both synthetic and real scenes captured with multi-camera and handheld single-camera setups. The method successfully magnifies subtle 3D motions even for handheld videos, which existing 2D magnification techniques fail to handle.In summary, the key hypothesis is that extending Eulerian video magnification principles to operate on temporal variations in neurally encoded 3D scene representations like NeRF can enable practical and effective magnification of subtle 3D motions from multi-view or monocular videos. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for 3D motion magnification using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Specifically:- They propose magnifying subtle motions in 3D scenes represented with NeRF by applying temporal filtering and amplification to the point embeddings over time, extending the Eulerian motion magnification principle from 2D videos to 3D NeRF embeddings.- They study and validate this idea using both standard NeRF with positional encoding as the point embedding and NeRF with tri-plane embedding. With tri-planes, they show the motion can be magnified using established 2D video magnification techniques like phase-based filtering by operating on the feature planes.- They demonstrate successful 3D motion magnification results on various real-world scenes captured under different camera setups, including handheld videos that are unsupported by prior 2D magnification methods. This shows their method's effectiveness and robustness. In summary, the key contribution is developing and validating the concept of 3D motion magnification on neural radiance fields, generalizing prior work on magnifying subtle motions in 2D videos and images. The method supports novel view synthesis and works on both multi-view and handheld monocular videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes a method for 3D motion magnification using neural radiance fields by analyzing and amplifying the temporal variations in point embeddings to magnify subtle motions from both multi-view and single-view captured scenes.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this 3D motion magnification paper compares to other related research:- Extends 2D video motion magnification to 3D. This work is novel in bringing the Eulerian perspective of motion magnification into the 3D domain. Prior work focused on magnifying subtle motions in 2D videos from a fixed viewpoint. This paper proposes methods to extend the idea to 3D scenes represented as neural radiance fields, enabling motion magnification from novel viewpoints.- Applies Eulerian analysis beyond color space. A core contribution is showing the effectiveness of applying temporal filtering and amplification to point embeddings of neural radiance fields, instead of just pixel colors. The paper explores different strategies like modifying positional encoding versus learned embeddings.- Supports handheld and moving cameras. By working in 3D, the method can separate scene motion from camera motion. This enables motion magnification from handheld videos, which fail catastrophically for 2D methods relying on a fixed viewpoint. - Validated on both synthetic and real data. The paper includes experiments on Blender scenes with ground truth motions for quantitative evaluation. It also shows magnification results on real multi-view and monocular videos to demonstrate practical applicability.- Builds on standard NeRF pipelines. The proposed modifications like learning time-varying embeddings are simple extensions to existing NeRF frameworks. This contrasts other concurrent work on modeling dynamic scenes which require architectural changes or additional training constraints.Overall, the key novelty is in extending the Eulerian perspective on motion magnification to 3D neural scene representations. The paper makes good contributions in proposing and evaluating different strategies to achieve this goal. The results help move motion magnification closer to practical uses.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:- Exploring other neural scene representations beyond NeRF as the backbone for 3D motion magnification. The authors propose using NeRF in this work, but other scene representations could also potentially be used.- Extending the method to dynamic scenes with large motions, not just subtle motions. The current method focuses on small imperceptible motions, but extending it to handle large motions could broaden the applicability.- Improving the robustness of the method to real-world noise and inaccuracies like pose estimation errors. The limitations section mentions that real-world issues like camera shake and inaccurate poses can degrade performance. Further research could aim to make the method more robust to such problems. - Investigating other ways to model motion and appearance variations over time beyond just modifying the point embeddings of NeRF. The current method models all scene changes over time through changes in the point embeddings. Exploring other ways to represent motion and appearance changes could be interesting.- Studying how traditional signal processing techniques could be integrated into other types of neural implicit representations beyond radiance fields. The authors believe their work could inspire further research in this direction more broadly.- Validating the approach on more diverse and challenging real-world scenes. More extensive testing on complex dynamic real-world scenes could reveal other limitations and areas for improvement.So in summary, some key future directions are enhancing the backbone scene representation, handling larger motions, improving robustness, exploring alternative motion modeling approaches, integrating signal processing into other implicit neural representations, and more comprehensive real-world validation. More research along these lines could help advance 3D motion magnification and related techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper presents a method for 3D motion magnification using neural radiance fields (NeRF). The goal is to magnify subtle 3D motions from dynamic scenes captured either by multiple synchronized cameras or a moving handheld camera. The approach represents the dynamic scene with a time-varying radiance field and applies the Eulerian principle for motion magnification to amplify temporal variations in the embedding vectors of each spatial location. They study applying linear and phase-based magnification on both positional encoding and tri-plane embeddings for NeRF. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate that the proposed approach can effectively magnify subtle motions and support novel view synthesis. A key advantage over prior 2D magnification techniques is the ability to handle videos from moving cameras by separating camera and object motions. Limitations include sensitivity to inaccurate camera poses and blurry training data. The work demonstrates the promise of integrating traditional signal processing techniques into neural scene representations.
