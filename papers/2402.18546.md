# [Generalizability Under Sensor Failure: Tokenization + Transformers   Enable More Robust Latent Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Neuroscience experiments vary across sessions, subjects, and sensors, leading to inherent variability in neural data recordings. Models that generalize well across these dimensions are needed. 
- Prior work has studied model generalization across sessions and subjects, but few works have studied robustness to sensor failure, which is highly prevalent.

Objectives:
- Study model generalizability across sessions, subjects, and sensors (with a focus on sensor failure) using EEG neural time series data
- Compare two models - EEGNet (CNN) and TOTEM (tokenizer + transformers) 

Methods:
- Collected a rich EEG dataset across 2 subjects, 2 sessions each, 128 sensors, 600 trials/session 
- Defined taxonomy of generalization cases: within session (baseline), cross session, cross subject, variable sensor failure (0-100%)
- Trained and evaluated EEGNet and TOTEM across all cases
- Analyzed TOTEM's latent codebooks for interpretability 

Key Results:
- TOTEM matches or exceeds EEGNet across all cases
- TOTEM is more robust to sensor failure 
- Analysis shows TOTEM's tokenization enables similar latent spaces across sessions/subjects/sensors

Main Contributions:  
- Rigorously evaluated model generalization, especially robustness to sensor failure
- Showed tokenization + transformers enable more robust representations
- Highlighted the need to evaluate models on generalization cases beyond within session

Limitations and Future Work:
- Only studied sensor failure via masking, should try other failure modes
- Want to extend techniques to other neural modalities beyond EEG
