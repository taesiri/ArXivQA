# [Generalizability Under Sensor Failure: Tokenization + Transformers   Enable More Robust Latent Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18546)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Neuroscience experiments vary across sessions, subjects, and sensors, leading to inherent variability in neural data recordings. Models that generalize well across these dimensions are needed. 
- Prior work has studied model generalization across sessions and subjects, but few works have studied robustness to sensor failure, which is highly prevalent.

Objectives:
- Study model generalizability across sessions, subjects, and sensors (with a focus on sensor failure) using EEG neural time series data
- Compare two models - EEGNet (CNN) and TOTEM (tokenizer + transformers) 

Methods:
- Collected a rich EEG dataset across 2 subjects, 2 sessions each, 128 sensors, 600 trials/session 
- Defined taxonomy of generalization cases: within session (baseline), cross session, cross subject, variable sensor failure (0-100%)
- Trained and evaluated EEGNet and TOTEM across all cases
- Analyzed TOTEM's latent codebooks for interpretability 

Key Results:
- TOTEM matches or exceeds EEGNet across all cases
- TOTEM is more robust to sensor failure 
- Analysis shows TOTEM's tokenization enables similar latent spaces across sessions/subjects/sensors

Main Contributions:  
- Rigorously evaluated model generalization, especially robustness to sensor failure
- Showed tokenization + transformers enable more robust representations
- Highlighted the need to evaluate models on generalization cases beyond within session

Limitations and Future Work:
- Only studied sensor failure via masking, should try other failure modes
- Want to extend techniques to other neural modalities beyond EEG


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies the generalizability of EEG time series models across sessions, subjects, and sensor failure cases, finding that a tokenizer and transformer model (TOTEM) matches or outperforms a convolutional neural network model (EEGNet) across all cases, with analysis suggesting the tokenizer enables more robust latent spaces.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is studying and comparing the generalizability of two time series models (EEGNet and TOTEM) for decoding EEG signals across various challenging conditions - across sessions, across subjects, and under simulated sensor failure. 

The key findings are:

1) TOTEM, which uses tokenization and transformers, matches or outperforms EEGNet, a popular CNN model, across all generalizability dimensions studied. Specifically, TOTEM shows better cross-session and cross-subject generalization.

2) Analysis of TOTEM's latent codebooks suggests that the tokenization it uses enables the model to learn more robust and generalizable representations of the EEG signals. The codebooks learned have high similarity across sessions, subjects, and sensor availability.

3) The study highlights the importance of evaluating models not just on within-session decoding accuracy but also on various generalization cases reflective of real-world variability in neural data. TOTEM and EEGNet show similar within-session accuracy but very different generalization ability.

Overall, tokenization and transformers seem to be a promising approach for building generalizable decoders of noisy and variable neural time series data like EEG.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Generalizability - Studying how models perform on test data distributions that differ from the training distribution, such as across sessions, subjects, and sensor failure scenarios.

- Electroencephalography (EEG) - The neural recording modality used in the experiments, which is known to have high variability.

- Sensor failure - Artificially failing sensors during testing to evaluate model robustness. The paper studies failing 0-100% of sensors.

- EEGNet - A popular convolutional neural network model used as a comparison model.

- TOTEM - The proposed tokenization + transformer model which demonstrates improved generalizability over EEGNet.

- Tokenization - Learning a discrete codebook in a self-supervised way that helps the model achieve better generalization.

- Transformers - Sequence models that are sensor count and time length flexible.

- Latent space analysis - Analyzing the learned discrete codebooks across sessions and subjects to understand TOTEM's generalization capabilities.

The key focus areas are studying model generalizability across multiple variability dimensions common in neural data, and demonstrating that tokenization + transformers is a promising approach for handling such variability.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a taxonomy of generalization cases (within session, cross session, cross subject, sensor failure) to evaluate model robustness. Why is studying these generalization cases important for selecting robust models compared to just evaluating on within session performance? How does it give more insight into model capabilities?

2. The tokenization scheme used in TOTEM to create the discrete latent codebook is inspired by VQ-VAEs. What are the specific benefits of using a discrete tokenized representation compared to a continuous representation when it comes to enabling model generalization? 

3. The paper demonstrates that TOTEM's latent codebooks learned across sessions and subjects share high similarity both quantitatively (low MSE between matched codewords) and qualitatively (visual similarity of codewords). Why does this high overlap suggest good generalization properties? How does it enable applications like mass training of downstream components?

4. Error rates for both TOTEM and EEGNet increase approximately linearly as more sensors are failed in the sensor failure experiments. However, TOTEM's error rate increases slower than EEGNet's. What architectural differences between the two models contribute to TOTEM's improved robustness to sensor failure?

5. The sensor failure mode studied involves zeroing out sensor channels. What are other types of sensor failure modes that exist? How could the framework be extended to account for a more diverse set of sensor noise and artifacts?

6. The paper studies EEG data which has high variability and relatively low SNR. How do you think the model performance would change if applied to data modalities with higher SNRs like ECoG or stereo EEG? Would the relative performance between models remain similar?

7. What types of additional analyses could be done on the discrete sequence of tokens output by TOTEM's encoder to better understand what is being encoded and how well it captures concepts that generalize?

8. The paper focuses on motor decoding from EEG signals. What other types of outputs could these models be trained to predict that would depend more heavily on generalization (e.g. disease biomarkers)?

9. Error rates are higher in the cross session and cross subject cases compared to within session. What types of domain adaptation techniques could be used to try to reduce this performance gap?

10. The paper studies healthy subjects with high trial counts in a controlled setting. How do you think real-world applications of EEG decoding with patient populations could differ in terms of variability and challenges for generalization?
