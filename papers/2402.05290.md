# [Do Transformer World Models Give Better Policy Gradients?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05290)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Model-based reinforcement learning methods seek to optimize policies by unrolling and backpropagating through a learned world model. However, this often becomes impractical for long time horizons as typical world models like RNNs can induce unstable and hard-to-optimize loss landscapes. While transformers have been shown to efficiently propagate gradients over long sequences, the paper investigates if commonly used transformer world models also suffer from similar issues. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper first shows both theoretically and empirically that differentiating through commonly used history-based transformer world models still creates circuitous (unnecessarily long) gradient paths, which can be detrimental for long-term credit assignment. To address this, they propose Actions World Models (AWMs) - a class of world models that map an initial state and a sequence of actions directly to future states without explicitly modeling intermediate state transitions. AWMs entirely avoid circuitous gradients, allowing gradients to flow directly from states to actions. Theoretical analysis shows AWMs provide gradients analogous to differentiating directly through the underlying neural network architecture's gradients. Experiments demonstrate transformer AWMs generate easier to optimize landscapes and achieve superior performance compared to competitive model-free algorithms on challenging long-horizon continuous control tasks.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate commonly used transformer world models also suffer from circuitous gradients harmful for long-term credit assignment 
- Propose Actions World Models that avoid circuitous gradients by mapping actions directly to future states
- Provide theoretical analysis showing AWMs inherit favorable gradient properties of the underlying neural network 
- Empirically demonstrate transformer AWMs generate optimization landscapes easier to navigate than the true dynamics
- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging continuous control tasks requiring long-term credit assignment

The summary covers the key problem motivation, the proposed Actions World Models approach to address circuitous gradients, theoretical analysis providing foundations, and experimental results highlighting the benefits of using transformer AWMs for improved long-term credit assignment in reinforcement learning.
