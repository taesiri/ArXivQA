# [Structure from WiFi (SfW): RSSI-based Geometric Mapping of Indoor   Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is essential for autonomous robots, but often relies on sensors like cameras/lasers/ultrasound that have limitations in some scenarios (e.g. privacy concerns, bad lighting). 
- With WiFi being ubiquitous indoors, using WiFi signal strength (RSSI) for SLAM could address these limitations, but extracting geometric maps from RSSI remains challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel concept called "Structure from WiFi (SfW)" to generate 2D geometric maps using only WiFi RSSI and robot trajectory data. 
- It introduces "inverse k-visibility", which uses the concept of k-visibility from computational geometry to probabilistically estimate walls and free space. K-visibility refers to the number of times a line-of-sight between two points crosses walls.
- The "sparse inverse k-visibility" algorithm segments the trajectory by RSSI-based k-values. It then applies geometric rules to label free space and uses ray drawing/segmentation and Gaussian probability assignment to estimate occupied space.

Main Contributions:
- Brings k-visibility concept from computational geometry into robot mapping problems
- Proposes a mapping algorithm that can map most of the free space using only WiFi RSSI, without needing other sensors
- Introduces "inverse k-visibility" concept to probabilistically estimate walls from RSSI k-values
- Evaluates in simulation and real-world experiments, showing the algorithm can effectively map free space

In summary, the paper presents a novel WiFi RSSI-based mapping approach that can indicate the structure and free space of unknown indoor environments, with potential benefits over vision/laser-based methods. The results showcase its ability to map free space critical for planning and navigation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel algorithm called Structure from WiFi (SfW) that uses concepts from k-visibility research to map the free space of unknown indoor environments using only WiFi signal strength measurements and robot trajectory data, without relying on other sensors like cameras or lidars.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel algorithm called "sparse inverse k-visibility" for generating a 2D geometric map of an indoor environment using only WiFi signal strength measurements and trajectory information. Specifically:

- The paper brings concepts from the field of k-visibility research into robotics mapping problems. It proposes using known k-visibility information (quantified based on WiFi RSSI signals) to probabilistically estimate a map of the environment. 

- The algorithm maps most of the free space in the environment, which is significant as it allows robots to plan paths and navigate while avoiding obstacles, without relying on sensors like lidar, radar, or camera.

- The sparse inverse k-visibility algorithm has three main steps: (1) extracting k-values from WiFi signals along the robot's trajectory, (2) mapping free space using geometric rules, and (3) probabilistically mapping occupied space using ray drawing, ray segmentation and Gaussian probability assignment.

- Evaluations in simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in mapping free space and potential wall locations using only WiFi and trajectory information.

In summary, the key contribution is the novel WiFi-based mapping algorithm that can indicate the structure and traversable areas of an environment without reliance on other sensors or crowdsourcing. This could be useful in applications where conventional sensors are unavailable.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, here are some of the key terms and keywords that seem most relevant:

- WiFi-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Received signal strength indicator (RSSI)
- $k$-visibility 
- Inverse $k$-visibility 
- Sparse inverse $k$-visibility
- Occupancy grid mapping
- Free space mapping
- Structure from WiFi (SfW)
- Wall prediction from RSSI
- Wireless-based mapping

The paper proposes a new concept called "inverse $k$-visibility" which takes ideas from the field of $k$-visibility in computational geometry and applies them to the problem of mapping indoor environments using only WiFi signal strength data. The key idea is to infer geometric structure like walls from consecutive changes in measured k-values along rays cast from a WiFi router. The paper introduces algorithms for extracting k-values from RSSI, mapping free space, and assigning wall probability distributions. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the feasibility of mapping major free spaces without relying on other sensors. So the core focus seems to be on WiFi-based mapping, especially of free spaces, using $k$-visibility concepts.
