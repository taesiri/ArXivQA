# [Structure from WiFi (SfW): RSSI-based Geometric Mapping of Indoor   Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02235)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is essential for autonomous robots, but often relies on sensors like cameras/lasers/ultrasound that have limitations in some scenarios (e.g. privacy concerns, bad lighting). 
- With WiFi being ubiquitous indoors, using WiFi signal strength (RSSI) for SLAM could address these limitations, but extracting geometric maps from RSSI remains challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel concept called "Structure from WiFi (SfW)" to generate 2D geometric maps using only WiFi RSSI and robot trajectory data. 
- It introduces "inverse k-visibility", which uses the concept of k-visibility from computational geometry to probabilistically estimate walls and free space. K-visibility refers to the number of times a line-of-sight between two points crosses walls.
- The "sparse inverse k-visibility" algorithm segments the trajectory by RSSI-based k-values. It then applies geometric rules to label free space and uses ray drawing/segmentation and Gaussian probability assignment to estimate occupied space.

Main Contributions:
- Brings k-visibility concept from computational geometry into robot mapping problems
- Proposes a mapping algorithm that can map most of the free space using only WiFi RSSI, without needing other sensors
- Introduces "inverse k-visibility" concept to probabilistically estimate walls from RSSI k-values
- Evaluates in simulation and real-world experiments, showing the algorithm can effectively map free space

In summary, the paper presents a novel WiFi RSSI-based mapping approach that can indicate the structure and free space of unknown indoor environments, with potential benefits over vision/laser-based methods. The results showcase its ability to map free space critical for planning and navigation.
