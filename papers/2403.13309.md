# [Mapping LLM Security Landscapes: A Comprehensive Stakeholder Risk   Assessment Proposal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13309)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) bring tremendous capabilities but also introduce new security risks that are not well understood or managed. 
- Existing threat studies like OWASP Top 10 for LLMs and MITRE ATLAS provide an overview of risks but lack concrete methods to assess risks for specific systems.
- There is a need for risk assessment processes tailored to evaluating risks from LLM integration for security practitioners and developers.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper demonstrates applying the OWASP risk rating methodology to assess LLM risks through a 3-step process:
   1) Scenario analysis to estimate threat agent factors
   2) Dependency mapping to align system components with vulnerability factors 
   3) Impact analysis to evaluate technical and business impact
- This analysis feeds into a threat matrix that summarizes risks for 3 key LLM stakeholder groups: LLM fine-tuning developers, LLM API integration developers, and end users.

Main Contributions:
- Outlines a systematic risk assessment process combining scenario analysis, dependency mapping and impact analysis to evaluate risks from LLM integration
- Provides a generic LLM threat matrix covering OWASP Top 10 risks that can be tailored by stakeholders for their systems
- Demonstrates the risk assessment methodology on a hypothetical university virtual assistant use case, assessing risks like prompt injection and data poisoning
- Empowers security practitioners and developers to make informed decisions on LLM risk mitigation and resource allocation
- Serves as a foundation for more robust risk assessment practices as LLMs continue to advance

In summary, the paper bridges the gap between identifying LLM risks and assessing their criticality by outlining an actionable risk assessment process for key stakeholders along with a customizable threat matrix. This aims to pave the way for more secure and reliable LLM adoption.
