# [Optimal Attack and Defense for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Optimal Attack and Defense for Reinforcement Learning":

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents interact with environments and can be vulnerable to attacks that manipulate this interaction. Prior work has studied specific types of "online manipulation attacks" like changing the agent's observation of the state. However, provably optimal attacks and defenses have not been developed. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors formulate the attack problem as solving a "meta-MDP" from the attacker's perspective. By viewing its interaction with the victim and environment as an MDP, the attacker can compute optimal attacks using standard RL techniques. 

- For defense, they formulate a stochastic Stackelberg game where the victim computes a policy that is robust to the worst-case attack. This game can be captured by a partially-observable turn-based stochastic game (POTBSG). Computing optimal defenses is NP-hard in general, but can be done efficiently in many cases, like when excluding observation attacks.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to compute provably optimal attacks for any combination of attack surfaces, including beyond perceived-state attacks. Shows these attacks can be computed efficiently.

- Argues the defense problem is naturally modeled as a stochastic Stackelberg game, captured by a POTBSG. Provides first defense algorithms with provable guarantees.

- Shows computing approximately optimal Markovian defenses is NP-hard, but gives settings where optimal defenses can be computed efficiently, like when excluding observation attacks or in the finite horizon setting.

In summary, the paper provides fundamental frameworks and algorithms for studying optimal attacks and defenses in adversarial RL settings. Key results include efficiently computable optimal attacks and defenses for broad classes of problems.
