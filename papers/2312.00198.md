# [Optimal Attack and Defense for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00198)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Optimal Attack and Defense for Reinforcement Learning":

Problem:
- Reinforcement learning (RL) agents interact with environments and can be vulnerable to attacks that manipulate this interaction. Prior work has studied specific types of "online manipulation attacks" like changing the agent's observation of the state. However, provably optimal attacks and defenses have not been developed. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors formulate the attack problem as solving a "meta-MDP" from the attacker's perspective. By viewing its interaction with the victim and environment as an MDP, the attacker can compute optimal attacks using standard RL techniques. 

- For defense, they formulate a stochastic Stackelberg game where the victim computes a policy that is robust to the worst-case attack. This game can be captured by a partially-observable turn-based stochastic game (POTBSG). Computing optimal defenses is NP-hard in general, but can be done efficiently in many cases, like when excluding observation attacks.

Main Contributions:
- First framework to compute provably optimal attacks for any combination of attack surfaces, including beyond perceived-state attacks. Shows these attacks can be computed efficiently.

- Argues the defense problem is naturally modeled as a stochastic Stackelberg game, captured by a POTBSG. Provides first defense algorithms with provable guarantees.

- Shows computing approximately optimal Markovian defenses is NP-hard, but gives settings where optimal defenses can be computed efficiently, like when excluding observation attacks or in the finite horizon setting.

In summary, the paper provides fundamental frameworks and algorithms for studying optimal attacks and defenses in adversarial RL settings. Key results include efficiently computable optimal attacks and defenses for broad classes of problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper develops frameworks for computing optimal attacks that maximize an adversary's reward against a reinforcement learning agent, as well as optimal defenses for the agent that are provably robust against the worst-case attack.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Developing frameworks for computing optimal attacks and defenses for any combination of attack surfaces in adversarial reinforcement learning. The attacks are provably efficient to compute in many cases. 

2) Showing that the attacker's problem can be formulated as a meta-MDP, which induces a higher level environment capturing the interaction between the victim, attacker, and true environment. Standard RL techniques can then be used to derive optimal attacks.

3) Arguing the defense problem is naturally modeled as a stochastic Stackelberg game, which can be captured by a partially-observable turn-based stochastic game (POTBSG). Solutions to this game yield optimally robust defense policies.

4) Providing the first defense algorithms with provable guarantees. In many settings, the defenses can be computed or learned efficiently. For example, when excluding observation attacks in the planning setting or when the attacker is adversarial in the fully observable setting without perceived-state attacks.

In summary, the main contribution is developing principled attack and defense frameworks with theoretical guarantees on efficiency, optimality, and robustness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a meta-MDP framework for computing optimal attacks. How does the construction of the meta-MDP enable leveraging standard RL algorithms? What are the key differences in dynamics between the meta-MDP and the original MDP that facilitate this?

2. The paper shows that optimal attacks can be computed efficiently even against linear MDPs. What is the inherent difficulty in applying prior attack formulations like the perceived-state attack MDP to the linear setting? How does the meta-MDP construction overcome this difficulty? 

3. The paper models the defense problem as a weak Stackelberg equilibrium (WSE) of a partially observable turn-based stochastic game (POTBSG). What are the benefits of using this game-theoretic formulation over a standard robust optimization approach? What challenges arise in computing WSEs and how does the paper address them?

4. In the adversarial setting, the paper shows the defense problem reduces to finding a Nash equilibrium (NE) of a zero-sum POTBSG. However, NEs in general stochastic games can be intractable to compute. What structural properties of POTBSGs make computing NEs easier in this case?

5. The paper gives a polynomial time algorithm for computing optimal defenses against non-perceived state attacks in finite-horizon settings. walk through the key steps of the backward induction approach and explain how it avoids brute-force search over the entire policy space.  

6. The constructions for the meta-MDP and POTBSG involve ``slowing down" the discount factor. Explain the purpose of transforming the discount factor in this way and what problems it avoids.

7. Discuss the differences in modeling state attacks at the two different subtimes t1 and t3. What are the tradeoffs between the two models and why does the paper focus on one version?

8. How does the meta-MDP formulation extend to handling non-Markovian victim policies? What changes need to be made in the construction and how do they enable guarantees for general policy classes?

9. Explain the multi-agent extension for the case of multiple victims interacting with one attacker. What simplification makes this extension seamless to handle and why is it useful to consider?

10. The paper leaves open the complexity of computing approximate or restricted optimal defenses in the general POMDP setting. What approaches might one take to make progress on these questions? What barriers need to be overcome?
