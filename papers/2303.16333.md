# [Flow supervision for Deformable NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16333)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new method for supervising deformable neural radiance fields (NeRF) using optical flow, with the goal of improving novel view synthesis for monocular videos with rapid object motion. 

The key research question is: how can optical flow be used to provide temporal supervision for the backward warping field used in deformable NeRF?

The main hypothesis is that enforcing optical flow constraints between frames will provide useful temporal regularization that helps deformable NeRF avoid poor local minima during optimization. This will improve deformable NeRF's performance on videos with more rapid object motion compared to using only photometric supervision.

The key insight presented is that the backward warping function used in deformable NeRF does not need to be inverted to compute scene flows between frames. By applying the inverse function theorem, velocities can be analytically computed from the backward warp. These velocities are then integrated over time to compute scene flows for optical flow supervision.

So in summary, this paper hypothesizes that optical flow supervision computed directly from the backward warp will improve deformable NeRF optimization, and presents a method to achieve this supervision without needing to invert the warp function. Experiments validate the hypothesis by demonstrating improved novel view synthesis on challenging monocular video datasets.
