# [Flow supervision for Deformable NeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16333)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper presents a new method for supervising deformable neural radiance fields (NeRF) using optical flow, with the goal of improving novel view synthesis for monocular videos with rapid object motion. 

The key research question is: how can optical flow be used to provide temporal supervision for the backward warping field used in deformable NeRF?

The main hypothesis is that enforcing optical flow constraints between frames will provide useful temporal regularization that helps deformable NeRF avoid poor local minima during optimization. This will improve deformable NeRF's performance on videos with more rapid object motion compared to using only photometric supervision.

The key insight presented is that the backward warping function used in deformable NeRF does not need to be inverted to compute scene flows between frames. By applying the inverse function theorem, velocities can be analytically computed from the backward warp. These velocities are then integrated over time to compute scene flows for optical flow supervision.

So in summary, this paper hypothesizes that optical flow supervision computed directly from the backward warp will improve deformable NeRF optimization, and presents a method to achieve this supervision without needing to invert the warp function. Experiments validate the hypothesis by demonstrating improved novel view synthesis on challenging monocular video datasets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is deriving an analytical solution to compute velocities of objects directly from the backward warping field of deformable NeRF. This allows using optical flow as supervision to improve novel view synthesis results for videos with rapid object motions.  

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- Deriving velocities from the backward warp using the inverse function theorem, without needing to invert the warp. This makes it applicable to many deformation representations.

- Using the velocities to compute scene flows via temporal integration. This allows enforcing optical flow constraints on the deformation field. 

- Demonstrating significant improvements on monocular novel view synthesis, especially for videos with rapid motions. 

- Advocating to remove gauge freedom in deformable NeRF by attaching the canonical frame to an input frame. This improves background stability.

Overall, this work enables using optical flow supervision for deformable NeRF in an efficient and generalizable manner. The flow supervision helps optimize the deformation field and improve view synthesis. This could be useful for other dynamic 3D reconstruction works using deformable representations.
