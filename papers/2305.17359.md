## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is: Does incorporating human dimensions into wildlife translocation planning efforts lead to better conservation outcomes?The authors hypothesize that including objectives related to human dimensions (such as community engagement, conflict mitigation, stakeholder involvement, etc.) in wildlife translocation planning will be associated with improved population outcomes for the translocated species. Specifically, their hypothesis is that translocation projects that incorporate human dimension objectives will have a higher probability of survival, reproduction, and population growth for the translocated wildlife populations compared to projects that do not include such objectives.To test this hypothesis, the authors analyzed data from a database of wildlife translocation projects to assess whether inclusion of human dimension objectives was associated with better population outcomes. Their key findings support their hypothesis - translocation efforts involving human dimensions had 1.5 times greater likelihood of success compared to those that did not.In summary, the central research question is whether incorporating human dimensions in translocation planning leads to improved wildlife population outcomes, which the authors addressed through quantitative analysis of an existing dataset of translocation projects. Their findings confirm their hypothesis that including human-related objectives is associated with greater translocation success.
