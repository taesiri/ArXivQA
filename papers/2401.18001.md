# [Desiderata for the Context Use of Question Answering Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Context-based question answering (QA) systems have shown progress, but still struggle with robustness issues when faced with noisy or conflicting information in the context. 
- Prior work has evaluated these issues (e.g. noise, conflicting knowledge) in isolation, making it hard to see connections and trends across problems.

Solution:
- The authors propose a set of desiderata (requirements) that outline how an ideal QA system should handle different types of context. This includes being robust to distracting text, adapting answers when context provides conflicting info, etc.
- They survey related work through the lens of the desiderata and develop a toolkit to evaluate systems on all desiderata simultaneously using modified test sets. 

Experiments & Findings:
- The toolkit is used to test 15 QA systems across 5 datasets on the various desiderata test cases.
- Key trends found: Systems less susceptible to noise tend to be more answer-consistent with irrelevant context; systems more susceptible to noise are often better at using conflicting context; combining noise and conflicting context can hugely impact performance.
- The simultaneous testing highlights connections between robustness issues that were missed when evaluating them individually in prior work.

Main Contributions:
- First unified desiderata and literature review evaluating context usage in QA systems
- Toolkit to prepare test sets to easily evaluate systems on all desiderata factors together 
- Experiments on 15 systems revealing new insights on tradeoffs between robustness issues
- Framework and analysis methodology enabling better understanding of model weaknesses to guide progress


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper outlines a set of desiderata for context-based QA systems, surveys related work, and experiments with these desiderata on 15 QA systems to reveal novel trends about their robustness, consistency, and use of parametric vs contextual knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Outlining a set of desiderata (requirements) for evaluating context-based question answering systems, including both previously discussed desiderata as well as some novel ones. These aim to define how an "ideal" QA system should use context.

2) Providing an extensive survey of related work, grouping and discussing papers according to the desiderata. This gives an overview of the state of research on context usage in QA.

3) Publicly releasing a toolkit to prepare datasets for evaluating QA systems according to all the desiderata at once. This allows seeing trends across different issues like robustness to noise and conflicting knowledge.

4) Evaluating 15 QA models on 5 datasets using the toolkit and analyzing the results. This revealed several novel findings, like the combination of noise and conflicting knowledge hurting performance much more than either alone.

In summary, the main contribution is defining desiderata for context usage in QA, surveying related work, providing a toolkit to evaluate models on all desiderata, and experiments that uncover new trends by taking a unified perspective across different context usage issues. The desiderata and analysis help increase understanding of QA models and point to ways they can be improved.

The paper outlines desiderata (requirements or necessary features) for ideal context-based QA systems. It surveys prior work and evaluates systems on aspects like robustness to noise, handling of conflicting knowledge versus parametric knowledge, consistency, and performance on known versus unknown knowledge. Key terms reflect this focus on desiderata, different types of knowledge, robustness, and consistency in QA systems.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a set of desiderata for evaluating context-based question answering systems. Could you explain the motivation behind proposing these specific desiderata? What gap in the literature are they trying to address?

2. One of the key aspects of the proposed desiderata is evaluating models on both known and unknown knowledge. Why is making this distinction important? How does it change the way we should evaluate QA systems?

3. The paper finds that models which are more robust to noise are not necessarily more consistent in their answers when given irrelevant context. What might explain this counterintuitive finding? What are the implications?  

4. What novel trends and insights emerge from evaluating models across all desiderata simultaneously instead of in isolation? What does this reveal about the inner workings and failure modes of QA systems?

5. The combination of conflicting knowledge and noise is shown to dramatically reduce model performance in some cases. What factors determine the extent of performance degradation in this setting? How might models be made more robust?  

6. The paper finds interesting differences between MCQA and free-form QA models - could you summarize and interpret these differences with regards to the evaluated desiderata?

7. The proposed method generates conflicting knowledge using a masked LM. What are the limitations of this approach? How else might conflicting knowledge be generated in a more targeted, semantically-aware manner?

8. What future directions for research are suggested by the trends uncovered through evaluation across these desiderata? What open questions remain regarding context usage in QA systems?

9. How suitable are the proposed desiderata for evaluating conversational QA systems? What additional desiderata might be needed to assess challenges unique to multi-turn dialog?

10. The paper only examines extractive QA datasets - to what extent could the proposed evaluation methodology apply to abstractive QA and generative tasks? What modifications would enable insightful assessment of generative language models?
