# [FDM Printing: a Fabrication Method for Fluidic Soft Circuits?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01131)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Existing fluidic soft logic gates for controlling soft robots rely on extensive manual fabrication or expensive printing methods. This limits accessibility and widespread adoption. The authors choose the soft bistable valve as a reference element, which takes 27 hours to fabricate manually via replica molding.

Proposed Solution:
The authors explore using an affordable desktop FDM printer (Prusa MK3S, $649) and commercially available thermoplastic polyurethane (Filaflex 60A) to 3D print soft bistable logic valves. Their goal is to reduce fabrication time and cost to democratize fluidic circuits for soft robot control.

Key Contributions:

1) Design and fabrication of a fully 3D printable soft bistable valve using FDM.

2) Reduction of valve fabrication time from 27 hours (replica molding) to 3 hours using their FDM approach. 

3) Introduction of a custom nozzle for directly extruding tubing from an FDM printer.

4) Demonstration of optimizing XOR gates to 3 logic gates (from 5) and D-Latch circuits to 3 logic gates (from 6) using their printed valves.

5) Incorporation of their 3D printed soft valve into a graduate course on Printable Robotics at WPI.

In summary, the authors present an inexpensive FDM printing approach to fabricate complex soft fluidic logic valves and circuits. Their method significantly reduces fabrication time compared to conventional manual processes to under 3 hours. This enables rapid prototyping and aims to make fluidic control elements more accessible for soft robotics research and education.
