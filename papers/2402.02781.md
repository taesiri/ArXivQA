## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Dual Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sound Event Detection":

Problem:
- Sound event detection (SED) aims to recognize specific sounds and their temporal locations in audio signals. This is useful for applications like surveillance and healthcare monitoring. 
- SED models like convolution recurrent neural networks (CRNNs) have high complexity making deployment on edge devices challenging. 
- Existing methods for model compression like knowledge distillation have limitations when combined with semi-supervised approaches like the mean teacher method, resulting in conflicting optimization objectives.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a dual knowledge distillation framework with two components:
   1) Temporal-averaging knowledge distillation (TAKD): Indirectly transfers knowledge from a teacher to student model using a mean student derived from temporal averaging of the student weights. Addresses optimization conflicts in conventional distillation.
   2) Embedding-enhanced feature distillation (EEFD): Incorporates an embedding distillation layer in student model to enable learning from pretrained embeddings without computational overhead at inference.
- The framework enables developing efficient SED models suitable for edge devices.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes TAKD method to stabilize knowledge transfer through a mean student model.
- Introduces EEFD method to integrate pretrained embeddings for enhanced learning without inference overhead.
- Overall dual distillation framework allows creating compact SED models with high accuracy.
- Evaluated on DCASE 2023 dataset, a model with 1/3 parameters achieves better performance than baseline, highlighting framework's significance.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in model compression for SED via a novel dual knowledge distillation approach, demonstrating how compact yet accurate SED models can be developed to enable edge device deployment.
