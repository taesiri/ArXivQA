# [Is Modularity Transferable? A Case Study through the Lens of Knowledge   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modular deep learning approaches like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with methods like Adapters and LoRA have shown benefits for transfer learning. However, current research assumes the base pretrained language model (PLM) remains fixed. 
- The concept of "transferable modularity", transferring modules between different PLMs, is overlooked. This could reduce computational costs and better utilize knowledge from larger PLMs transferred to smaller ones.
- The term "modularity" implies transferability between models, but this has not been explored.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate transferable modularity in two scenarios: (1) matching PLMs - student is a shallow distilled version of teacher, (2) incompatible PLMs - student is smaller, independent PLM with different dimensionality.
- For incompatible PLMs, propose a parameter-free pruning and alignment method to match dimensions and alignments of modules.

Experiments:
- Evaluate on NER, PI, NLI tasks in 20+ languages using mBERT/DistilmBERT (matching) and XLM-R large/base (incompatible) pairs.
- Compare module transfer to baseline fine-tuning and teacher performance.
- Matching PLMs consistently improve over baseline by closing the gap to teacher.
- Incompatible PLMs show inconsistent improvements, indicating limitations of current modular techniques.

Main Contributions:
- Define the concept of transferable modularity
- Show potential for transferability between matching PLMs
- Propose pruning/alignment method for incompatible transfer
- Show limitations of current methods for incompatible transfer
- Initiate research into transferable modularity to move beyond single-PLM constraints

The paper shows the initial potential of transferable modularity between matching PLMs and proposes methods for incompatible transfer, while highlighting the need for future work to realize the full potential of module transferability across diverse models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the transferability of modular components, such as adapters and LoRA, between different pre-trained language models for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, proposing methods to enable module transfer between incompatible models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Defining the property of transferable modularity, which refers to the potential to transfer modules between different models rather than only within a single pre-trained language model (PLM). 

2. Investigating transferable modularity in two setups: (a) matching PLMs, where the teacher and student are variants of the same base model, and (b) incompatible PLMs, where the teacher and student have different internal dimensionality. For the latter case, the paper proposes a pruning and alignment method to match dimensions.

3. Showing that current modular approaches like adapters and LoRA can exhibit transferable modularity in the matching PLMs scenario, with transferred modules from a teacher PLM improving student performance. However, performance is inconsistent in the incompatible PLMs scenario, indicating limitations of current techniques.

In summary, the main contribution is initiating research into transferable modularity of modular deep learning techniques, including defining the concept, evaluating current methods, and proposing an approach to enable transfer between incompatible models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Modular Deep Learning
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) 
- Pre-trained Language Models (PLM)
- Knowledge Distillation
- Adapters
- LoRA
- Transferable modularity
- Multilingual models
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Natural Language Inference (NLI) 
- Paraphrase Identification (PI)

The paper explores the concept of "transferable modularity" - transferring pre-trained, task-specific PEFT modules between same-family PLMs or even incompatible PLMs. It uses tasks like NER, NLI, and PI over multiple languages to evaluate approaches for transferring modules from larger "teacher" models to smaller "student" models. The key terms reflect this focus on modularity, transfer learning, multilinguality, and standard NLP tasks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a pruning and alignment method to enable transfer of modules between incompatible PLMs. Can you explain in detail the four steps of this method (sampling, calculating correlation, solving LSA problem, pruning & alignment)? What are the advantages and potential limitations of this approach?

2. The paper evaluates transferable modularity in two scenarios - matching PLMs and incompatible PLMs. What are the key differences between these two scenarios? Why was transfer more effective for matching PLMs compared to incompatible PLMs?

3. The paper finds that the SKIP method works better than AVG for transferring modules between matching PLMs. What is the likely explanation for this based on the internal modularity and layer-wise specialization of Transformers?

4. Could the lower performance of transferred modules between incompatible PLMs be attributed to ineffective alignment? If so, what improvements could be made to the correlation-based alignment approach to make it more robust? 

5. How suitable is the linear sum assignment (LSA) problem formulation for establishing alignment between latent spaces of incompatible PLMs? Could more complex optimization methods like neural matching be beneficial?

6. The transferred modules are used to initialize student models before fine-tuning. Could alternative approaches like continual knowledge distillation during fine-tuning improve performance further?

7. The pruning and alignment method enables one-time offline adaptation of modules without increasing inference complexity. How does this benefit the practical usage of transferable modularity?

8. How could the transferable modularity idea be extended to conditional computational modules like routing transformers? What challenges need to be addressed?

9. For incompatible PLMs, could transferable modularity be more effective when the teacher is a scaled-up version of the student rather than a different model?

10. The paper studies transfer at the module level. Could transferable modularity also be explored at other levels of abstraction like attention heads, layers or model chains?
