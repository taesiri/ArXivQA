# [Is Modularity Transferable? A Case Study through the Lens of Knowledge   Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Modular deep learning approaches like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with methods like Adapters and LoRA have shown benefits for transfer learning. However, current research assumes the base pretrained language model (PLM) remains fixed. 
- The concept of "transferable modularity", transferring modules between different PLMs, is overlooked. This could reduce computational costs and better utilize knowledge from larger PLMs transferred to smaller ones.
- The term "modularity" implies transferability between models, but this has not been explored.

Proposed Solution:
- Investigate transferable modularity in two scenarios: (1) matching PLMs - student is a shallow distilled version of teacher, (2) incompatible PLMs - student is smaller, independent PLM with different dimensionality.
- For incompatible PLMs, propose a parameter-free pruning and alignment method to match dimensions and alignments of modules.

Experiments:
- Evaluate on NER, PI, NLI tasks in 20+ languages using mBERT/DistilmBERT (matching) and XLM-R large/base (incompatible) pairs.
- Compare module transfer to baseline fine-tuning and teacher performance.
- Matching PLMs consistently improve over baseline by closing the gap to teacher.
- Incompatible PLMs show inconsistent improvements, indicating limitations of current modular techniques.

Main Contributions:
- Define the concept of transferable modularity
- Show potential for transferability between matching PLMs
- Propose pruning/alignment method for incompatible transfer
- Show limitations of current methods for incompatible transfer
- Initiate research into transferable modularity to move beyond single-PLM constraints

The paper shows the initial potential of transferable modularity between matching PLMs and proposes methods for incompatible transfer, while highlighting the need for future work to realize the full potential of module transferability across diverse models.
