# [From Beginner to Expert: Modeling Medical Knowledge into General LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01040)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) have difficulty with sensitive applications like reasoning over medical knowledge and answering medical questions.  
- Prior studies have tried to address this by increasing model size (>100B parameters) to learn more medical knowledge, but there is still room for improvement in smaller LLMs (<100B parameters).

Proposed Solution:  
The authors present a methodology to fine-tune a 10B parameter general pre-trained LLM (AntGLM) into a medical expert model (AntGLM-Med-10B) using a 3-stage optimization procedure:

1. General Medical Knowledge Injection: Continual pre-training on large-scale medical textbooks, knowledge graphs, exam questions and articles to inject basic medical knowledge.  

2. Medical Domain Instruction Tuning: Fine-tuning on Chinese medical exam questions, medical QA datasets and multiple choice questions to learn diverse medical task types.

3. Specific Medical Task Adaptation: Tailoring to a specific clinical task (multi-choice question answering) using PubMedQA dataset. A novel Verification-of-Choice prompting strategy is introduced to enhance reasoning.

Main Contributions:

- Investigating adapting general pre-trained LLMs into the medical domain for specific medical tasks through a 3-stage optimization procedure.

- Collecting and constructing large-scale medical datasets for each optimization stage, encompassing diverse data types (QA, reasoning, conversations) and tasks.  

- Introducing a Verification-of-Choice prompt engineering technique for multi-choice medical questions to improve LLM reasoning.

- Achieving strong performance on PubMedQA medical QA task, even outperforming larger LLMs. Demonstrates optimizing smaller LLMs effectively for medical domain.

The paper provides a methodology grounded in multi-stage optimization strategies and medical data curation to transform general language models into specialized medical expert models for better clinical reasoning. The performance demonstrates this is a promising approach even without extensively scaled models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper compares 30-day and 180-day post-hospital admission mortality rates for Medicare patients across 3 types of cardiac care, finding that 30-day mortality data can effectively discriminate hospital performance and correlate well with longer-term 180-day mortality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are threefold:

1. It investigates how to adapt a pre-trained general large language model (LLM) to the medical domain, transforming it from a medical beginner to a medical expert. 

2. It collects and constructs large-scale medical datasets for each stage of the optimization process, including continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and task adaptation. The datasets encompass various data types and tasks like question-answering, reasoning, multi-choice questions, and medical conversations.

3. For multi-choice questions in the medical domain specifically, it proposes a novel Verification-of-Choice approach to prompting engineering which significantly enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs. 

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a comprehensive methodology to specialize a general LLM into a medical expert LLM, along with medical datasets and prompting strategies to enable each stage of optimization. The result is a 10B parameter medical LLM called AntGLM-Med-10B that achieves strong performance on the PubMedQA benchmark.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a 3-stage optimization procedure involving continual pre-training, instruction tuning, and task adaptation. Can you elaborate on why this step-wise procedure is more effective than directly fine-tuning on the end tasks? 

2. A key contribution is the collection of diverse medical datasets. What were some of the key challenges in curating quality data across different medical domains and tasks? How did you ensure diversity while also having coverage of core knowledge?

3. For the continual pre-training stage, you utilized several data sources like knowledge graphs and exam questions. Can you discuss how you handled converting these structured data sources into a format suitable for pre-training language models?

4. The instruction tuning utilizes techniques like LoRA and CPoly. Can you explain the benefits of using methods like LoRA and CPoly compared to simple fine-tuning approaches? What efficiencies did they enable?  

5. For task adaptation, Chain-of-Thought and Chain-of-Verification prompting strategies are used. How do these prompting strategies help enhance reasoning for question answering compared to regular prompting?

6. The Verification-of-Choice approach is novel. Can you walk through how it allows the model to verify and select the best choice? What results showed it improves multi-choice QA performance?

7. The final AntGLM-Med model achieves strong performance on PubMedQA, even outperforming larger models. To what do you attribute this? Is model scale still an important factor?

8. How transferable do you believe the techniques presented here are to adapting LLMs for other specialized domains beyond medicine? Would the overall optimization framework remain similar?

9. For real clinical deployment, performance metrics beyond accuracy are crucial. How might you modify the optimization approach to directly target metrics like F1 score or AUROC?

10. What directions seem most promising for further enhancing medical LLMs? Continued scaling or are there technique innovations you believe could push performance dramatically higher?
