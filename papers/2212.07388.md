# [NoPe-NeRF: Optimising Neural Radiance Field with No Pose Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to jointly optimize camera poses and a neural radiance field (NeRF) from a video sequence with unknown camera poses. Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to handle challenging camera motions and large rotations in the video, which previous unposed-NeRF methods struggle with. The key hypothesis is that using monocular depth maps to constrain the relative poses between frames can improve the pose estimation and in turn the novel view synthesis.The main contributions that aim to address this question are:- A method to integrate monocular depth maps into unposed-NeRF training by modeling and optimizing their scale and shift distortions. This aligns the depth maps to the NeRF volume.- Adding a loss term between consecutive frames using the undistorted depth maps to constrain the relative poses. This provides supervision for the global pose optimization.- A depth-based surface rendering loss to further improve the relative pose estimation.The experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can handle complex camera motions and outperforms previous unposed-NeRF techniques in terms of novel view synthesis quality and pose accuracy.In summary, the core hypothesis is that leveraging monocular depth to constrain relative poses can enable robust joint optimization of poses and NeRF on challenging video sequences. The proposed techniques effectively integrate depth into this framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing an end-to-end differentiable framework for jointly estimating camera poses and optimizing a neural radiance field (NeRF) from a sequence of images without known camera poses. The key ideas are:- Integrating monocular depth maps into the joint optimization to provide geometry cues and relative pose supervision between frames. This helps handle challenging camera motions.- Modeling scale and shift distortions of the monocular depth maps and optimizing them to align the depth with the NeRF volume. This provides undistorted depth maps for computing relative pose losses. - Proposing novel losses using the undistorted depth maps, including a point cloud loss for relative pose and a surface-based photometric loss to further constrain the poses.- Showing the proposed method, termed NoPose-NeRF, can handle complex indoor and outdoor scenes with large camera motions, and outperforms previous unposed-NeRF methods in terms of novel view synthesis quality and pose estimation accuracy.In summary, the key contribution is a novel way to effectively integrate monocular depth into unposed-NeRF training to enable handling complex camera motions. This is achieved through modeling depth distortions, providing relative pose supervision between frames, and using depth maps to constrain scene geometry.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper proposes NoPe-NeRF, a method to optimize neural radiance fields for novel view synthesis without requiring pre-computed camera poses, by incorporating monocular depth priors to constrain relative pose estimation between frames during joint camera pose and NeRF optimization.
