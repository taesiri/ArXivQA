# [NoPe-NeRF: Optimising Neural Radiance Field with No Pose Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to jointly optimize camera poses and a neural radiance field (NeRF) from a video sequence with unknown camera poses. 

Specifically, the paper proposes an approach to handle challenging camera motions and large rotations in the video, which previous unposed-NeRF methods struggle with. The key hypothesis is that using monocular depth maps to constrain the relative poses between frames can improve the pose estimation and in turn the novel view synthesis.

The main contributions that aim to address this question are:

- A method to integrate monocular depth maps into unposed-NeRF training by modeling and optimizing their scale and shift distortions. This aligns the depth maps to the NeRF volume.

- Adding a loss term between consecutive frames using the undistorted depth maps to constrain the relative poses. This provides supervision for the global pose optimization.

- A depth-based surface rendering loss to further improve the relative pose estimation.

The experiments on real-world indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can handle complex camera motions and outperforms previous unposed-NeRF techniques in terms of novel view synthesis quality and pose accuracy.

In summary, the core hypothesis is that leveraging monocular depth to constrain relative poses can enable robust joint optimization of poses and NeRF on challenging video sequences. The proposed techniques effectively integrate depth into this framework.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an end-to-end differentiable framework for jointly estimating camera poses and optimizing a neural radiance field (NeRF) from a sequence of images without known camera poses. The key ideas are:

- Integrating monocular depth maps into the joint optimization to provide geometry cues and relative pose supervision between frames. This helps handle challenging camera motions.

- Modeling scale and shift distortions of the monocular depth maps and optimizing them to align the depth with the NeRF volume. This provides undistorted depth maps for computing relative pose losses. 

- Proposing novel losses using the undistorted depth maps, including a point cloud loss for relative pose and a surface-based photometric loss to further constrain the poses.

- Showing the proposed method, termed NoPose-NeRF, can handle complex indoor and outdoor scenes with large camera motions, and outperforms previous unposed-NeRF methods in terms of novel view synthesis quality and pose estimation accuracy.

In summary, the key contribution is a novel way to effectively integrate monocular depth into unposed-NeRF training to enable handling complex camera motions. This is achieved through modeling depth distortions, providing relative pose supervision between frames, and using depth maps to constrain scene geometry.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes NoPe-NeRF, a method to optimize neural radiance fields for novel view synthesis without requiring pre-computed camera poses, by incorporating monocular depth priors to constrain relative pose estimation between frames during joint camera pose and NeRF optimization.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents an interesting approach for jointly optimizing camera poses and a neural radiance field (NeRF) for novel view synthesis from a video sequence. Here are some key ways it compares to other recent work in this area:

- Most prior work on pose-free NeRF optimization has focused on forward-facing or simple camera motions. This paper tackles more complex trajectories with large motions by incorporating monocular depth priors to help constrain the pose optimization. 

- Using a monocular depth network is a lightweight way to inject geometry priors compared to using multi-view stereo depth. The paper shows a novel method to undistort the mono-depth maps for consistency with the NeRF volume during optimization.

- The paper introduces relative pose losses between frames based on point cloud and photometric consistency. This provides an effective way to constrain the global pose optimization using local frame relations.

- Experiments show the method handles challenging indoor and outdoor scenes with complex camera motions better than recent baselines like NeRFmm, BARF, and SC-NeRF. It also matches or exceeds a COLMAP+NeRF pipeline.

- The approach is limited by the need for long optimization times and reliance on the accuracy of the mono-depth network. It does not handle very wide baseline motions or 360 capture.

Overall, this paper makes nice contributions in making pose-free NeRF optimization more robust by effectively incorporating mono-depth. The relative pose losses seem particularly helpful for complex trajectories. It pushes forward pose-free NeRF research for real casual video capture. Some key comparisons are to NeRFmm which lacked pose regularization, and BARF which handled only forward-facing cases. Extending this idea to very wide baselines or 360 capture remains an open challenge.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Improving the robustness and accuracy of joint pose and scene optimization in more challenging scenarios, such as scenes with large camera motion or 360 degree video. The current method still faces difficulties handling these cases.

- Extending the method to handle other types of camera distortion and inaccuracies in the monocular depth estimation beyond just scale and shift. The paper notes that other non-linear distortions can affect the optimization.

- Reducing the computation time and memory requirements of the training process. Like other NeRF methods, it still requires long optimization times and using the pairwise losses between frames is memory intensive.

- Applying the joint optimization framework to other tasks beyond novel view synthesis, such as for view extrapolation, interpolation, or super-resolution. The authors suggest their method is an important step towards applying unknown-pose NeRF models to large-scale scenes.

- Improving generalization by training across multiple scenes and exploring cross-instance pose optimization. The current method requires per-scene optimization.

- Combining ideas from other NeRF extensions, such as implicit representations, deformation modeling, semantic/conditional models etc. to potentially further improve the results.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving the robustness, efficiency, and generalization of the joint pose and scene optimization framework, as well as extending it to new tasks and combining it with other NeRF developments. Reducing the computational requirements would help enable real-world use cases and applications.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a novel method called NoPe-NeRF for joint pose estimation and novel view synthesis from a sequence of RGB images and their pseudo depth maps. The key ideas are:

1. They incorporate monocular depth maps into NeRF training by explicitly modeling scale and shift distortions. This provides local supervision for relative poses between frames and regularizes geometry reconstruction. 

2. They propose a Chamfer Distance loss between point clouds from adjacent undistorted depth maps to constrain relative pose estimation. This injects relative pose information into the system.

3. They further improve relative pose estimation with a surface-based photometric loss that assumes the undistorted depth defines the scene surface. 

4. Experiments on indoor and outdoor scenes show the method can handle challenging camera motions and outperforms existing unposed-NeRF methods in terms of novel view quality and pose accuracy. The improved pose estimation also leads to better geometry reconstruction.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel way to integrate monocular depth into unposed-NeRF training through undistorting depth maps on-the-fly. This enables stronger constraints on relative pose and geometry for handling complex camera motions. The overall approach jointly optimizes NeRF, poses and depth distortions in an end-to-end manner.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new method called NoPe-NeRF for jointly estimating camera poses and training a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from a video sequence without known camera poses. Existing methods like NeRFmm have difficulty handling videos with large camera motions. The key idea in NoPe-NeRF is to leverage monocular depth maps to provide geometry constraints that can regularize the joint optimization of poses and NeRF. The depth maps are first undistorted using estimated scale and shift parameters so they align with the NeRF geometry. Then two losses are used to constrain relative poses between frames: a point cloud loss using Chamfer distance on point clouds from adjacent undistorted depth maps, and a surface-based photometric loss. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show NoPe-NeRF can handle challenging camera motions and outperforms NeRFmm and other baselines in terms of novel view synthesis, pose accuracy, and depth estimation.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) A method to integrate monocular depth into unposed-NeRF training by modeling scale and shift distortions and undistorting the depths. (2) Constraining relative poses between frames using point cloud and surface-based losses on undistorted depths. (3) Demonstrating improved performance over NeRFmm and other baselines on challenging real-world indoor and outdoor datasets with large camera motions. NoPe-NeRF represents an important advance for training NeRF models from videos without known camera poses by leveraging monocular depth to handle complex motions.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes NoP-NeRF, a novel method for neural radiance field reconstruction and novel view synthesis from videos without known camera poses. The key ideas are:

1) They incorporate monocular depth estimation to provide geometry cues that help constrain the shape-radiance ambiguity in NeRF training. 

2) They explicitly model and optimize scale and shift parameters for each input mono-depth map to make them consistent with the NeRF volume. This provides undistorted and multi-view consistent depth maps.

3) They introduce two novel losses - a point cloud loss using Chamfer Distance between point clouds from consecutive undistorted depth maps to constrain relative pose, and a surface-based photometric loss for regularization. 

4) Jointly optimizing the NeRF, camera poses, and depth distortion parameters with a combined loss enables recovering accurate poses and high-quality view synthesis even for complex trajectories with large motions. Experiments on real-world indoor/outdoor datasets demonstrate strong improvements over previous state-of-the-art unposed-NeRF methods.

In summary, the key novelty is effectively integrating monocular depth estimation to provide both geometry cues through undistorted depth maps as well as relative pose constraints between frames. This leads to robust joint optimization of NeRF and poses even for challenging camera motions.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper addresses the problem of novel view synthesis and camera pose estimation from a sequence of RGB images and their pseudo depth maps. Specifically, it aims to tackle the challenge of handling large camera motions in this setting. 

The key questions it tries to address are:

- How can we incorporate monocular depth maps into the joint optimisation of camera poses and neural radiance fields (NeRFs), when the depth maps contain distortions and are not multi-view consistent?

- How can we constrain the relative poses between frames during this joint optimisation, to improve robustness and handle large camera rotations?

- Can incorporating undistorted monocular depth maps and constraining relative poses enable better novel view synthesis and more accurate camera pose estimation compared to existing methods?

Some more details on the key aspects:

- It proposes a way to explicitly model and optimise the scale and shift distortions in monocular depth maps, to make them aligned with the NeRF volume and hence multi-view consistent.

- It introduces two novel losses - point cloud loss and surface-based photometric loss - that leverage the undistorted depth maps to constrain the relative poses between consecutive frames.

- Experiments on challenging real-world indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrate the method's ability to handle complex camera motions and show improved performance over state-of-the-art in terms of novel view synthesis quality and pose accuracy.

In summary, the paper tries to address the limitations of previous unposed-NeRF methods in handling large camera motions, by effectively incorporating monocular depth and relative pose constraints. The goal is to make the joint optimisation more robust for complex trajectories.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, some of the key terms and concepts in this paper are:

- Neural Radiance Field (NeRF): The neural scene representation the paper is focused on improving. NeRFs represent a scene as a continuous volumetric function that maps 3D coordinates and viewing direction to color and density. 

- Camera pose estimation: Estimating the position and orientation (pose) of cameras that captured input images. This is a key prerequisite for training NeRF models.

- Novel view synthesis: Using a trained NeRF model to render photorealistic images from new camera viewpoints. This demonstrates how well the model has learned the scene geometry and appearance.

- Monocular depth estimation: Estimating depth from a single RGB image using a neural network. The paper proposes using this as a geometry prior. 

- Unposed NeRF training: Jointly optimizing both the NeRF model and camera poses, without relying on pre-computed poses.

- Shape-radiance ambiguity: An inherent ambiguity in NeRF training between interpreting features as changes in shape or changes in radiance. The paper aims to address this.

- Relative pose estimation: Estimating the pose between pairs of camera views rather than individually. This provides an inter-frame constraint.

- Undistorted monocular depth: Correcting scale and shift distortions in monocular depth maps using multiview consistency from NeRF.

- Chamfer distance loss: A loss function between point clouds that provides relative pose supervision.

In summary, the key focus is on improving camera pose estimation and novel view synthesis for NeRF models, using monocular depth as a prior while avoiding reliance on traditional pose estimation methods like SfM.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points in this paper:

This paper proposes NoPe-NeRF, a method to jointly optimize camera poses and a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) scene representation from an image sequence with large camera motions. Previous unposed-NeRF methods estimate each camera pose individually, facing difficulties with dramatic camera movements. NoPe-NeRF tackles this by integrating monocular depth priors to constrain relative poses between consecutive frames. Specifically, the authors explicitly model and optimize scale and shift parameters for each monocular depth map to make them multiview consistent with the NeRF scene. These undistorted depth maps are then utilized in two novel losses - a point cloud loss using Chamfer distance to inject relative pose information, and a surface-based photometric loss to further improve relative pose estimation. Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate NoPe-NeRF's ability to handle complex camera trajectories and show improved performance over existing methods in novel view synthesis quality, pose estimation accuracy, and depth map precision. The key contributions are the effective integration of monocular depth to mediate shape-radiance ambiguity, the inter-frame losses supplying relative pose constraints, and the depth-based surface rendering loss for further pose regularization.
