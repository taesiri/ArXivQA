# [Graph Transformer GANs for Graph-Constrained House Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08225)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we design an effective generative framework for graph-constrained house generation tasks by learning both global and local correlations across connected and non-connected graph nodes?

The key hypotheses are:

1) Combining graph convolutions and Transformer self-attentions in a novel graph Transformer generator can help capture both global node relationships as well as local node interactions for generating better house layouts.

2) A node classification-based discriminator can help preserve high-level semantic features of different room types. 

3) A graph-based cycle consistency loss can help maintain relative spatial relationships between nodes in the ground truth and generated graphs.

The authors propose a new graph Transformer GAN (GTGAN) framework to address the graph-constrained house generation problem by modeling both global and local dependencies in the input graph via a novel graph Transformer generator, while using a node classification discriminator and graph cycle consistency loss to further improve performance. Experiments on house layout and roof generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
