# [Graph Transformer GANs for Graph-Constrained House Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08225)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: How can we design an effective generative framework for graph-constrained house generation tasks by learning both global and local correlations across connected and non-connected graph nodes?

The key hypotheses are:

1) Combining graph convolutions and Transformer self-attentions in a novel graph Transformer generator can help capture both global node relationships as well as local node interactions for generating better house layouts.

2) A node classification-based discriminator can help preserve high-level semantic features of different room types. 

3) A graph-based cycle consistency loss can help maintain relative spatial relationships between nodes in the ground truth and generated graphs.

The authors propose a new graph Transformer GAN (GTGAN) framework to address the graph-constrained house generation problem by modeling both global and local dependencies in the input graph via a novel graph Transformer generator, while using a node classification discriminator and graph cycle consistency loss to further improve performance. Experiments on house layout and roof generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel graph Transformer generative adversarial network (GTGAN) for graph-constrained house generation. Specifically, the key contributions are:

- A graph Transformer-based generator that combines graph convolutions and self-attention to model both local and global interactions across connected and non-connected graph nodes. It uses a connected node attention and a non-connected node attention module.

- A node classification-based discriminator that helps preserve high-level semantic features of different house components. 

- A graph-based cycle consistency loss that maintains the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted graphs.

- Experiments on house layout generation and roof generation tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of GTGAN compared to previous methods like HouseGAN and RoofGAN.

In summary, the main contribution is developing a novel Transformer-based architecture for graph-constrained house generation that captures global and local graph relations while preserving semantic features and spatial relationships. The proposed GTGAN method achieves superior performance on this task.
