# [Empowering Federated Learning for Massive Models with NVIDIA FLARE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07792)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Centralizing data for training large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly difficult due to privacy concerns, regulations, geopolitics, copyright issues, and the effort to move large datasets. 
- Adapting general foundation LLMs to specific domains and tasks efficiently is also a key challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- Use federated learning (FL) enabled by the NVIDIA FLARE framework to train LLMs in a privacy-preserving distributed manner without centralizing data.
- Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) techniques on top of foundation LLMs using FL to efficiently adapt them to downstream tasks.
- Use new streaming capabilities in NVIDIA FLARE to support communication of very large models like modern LLMs.
- Provide simple Client API in NVIDIA FLARE to easily convert centralized training code to federated learning.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate FL-enabled PEFT and SFT of LLMs for natural language processing and biopharma applications using NVIDIA FLARE.
- Show quantitative results on streaming very large 128GB models over wide-area networks. 
- Introduce simple Client API requiring only 5 lines of code change to adapt centralized training to federated learning.
- Show sample Controller code to implement federated averaging algorithm on server.
- Present applications of FL for financial sentiment analysis, conversational response generation, protein structure prediction.

In summary, the paper proposes leveraging federated learning in NVIDIA FLARE to efficiently adapt foundation LLMs via fine-tuning techniques for various downstream applications while preserving data privacy. The new streaming capabilities and simple Client API aid in overcoming systems challenges for distributed LLM training.
