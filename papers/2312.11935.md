# [Parameterized Decision-making with Multi-modal Perception for Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11935)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing autonomous driving methods have two key limitations: 1) weak environmental adaptability, as they only work on simple scenarios like highways and cannot handle complex urban roads; 2) incomplete optimization objectives, as they ignore the impact of the autonomous vehicle's actions on surrounding traffic.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose an autonomous driving framework called AUTOPILOT that addresses the above limitations. The key ideas are:

1) Comprehensive perception of the environment using multi-modal inputs from HD maps and onboard sensors to capture features of lanes, vehicles, traffic lights. This enhances adaptability.

2) A graph-based model called LCA to efficiently learn a state representation from the multi-modal features. It uses agent-centric star graphs and cross attention to capture interactions. 

3) A parameterized action structure to separate high-level lane change decisions from low-level steering angle/acceleration controls. This allows accurately following lanes.

4) A hybrid reward function considering safety, efficiency, comfort and impact on surrounding vehicles. The impact reward penalizes actions that force other vehicles to decelerate, reducing negative effects.

5) A regularization technique and multi-worker training paradigm to enhance learning of the deep reinforcement learning model.

Main Contributions:

1) An end-to-end autonomous driving framework AUTOPILOT that uses multi-modal perception and deep reinforcement learning to make decisions on complex urban roads.

2) A graph-based model LCA for efficiently learning representations from multi-modal traffic features.

3) A parameterized action structure to decompose decisions and enable precise maneuvering. 

4) A hybrid reward function and regularization to optimize for safety, efficiency, comfort and minimal impact on surrounding traffic.

Experiments show AUTOPILOT advances state-of-the-art in both macroscopic traffic efficiency metrics and microscopic driving performance metrics. The components like multi-modal perception, parameterized actions and hybrid rewards are critical for its effectiveness.
