# [DiffV2S: Diffusion-based Video-to-Speech Synthesis with Vision-guided   Speaker Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07787)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: How can we synthesize intelligible and natural sounding speech from silent video, without requiring speaker embeddings from reference audio during inference?The key points I gathered are:- Previous video-to-speech synthesis methods have used speaker embeddings extracted from reference audio to help synthesize speech with the correct vocal characteristics. However, reference audio may not always be available. - This paper proposes a novel method to extract "vision-guided" speaker embeddings directly from silent video, eliminating the need for reference audio during inference.- They use a self-supervised pre-trained audio-visual model and prompt tuning to extract speaker embeddings from video frames. - These vision-guided speaker embeddings are then used to condition a diffusion model called DiffV2S to synthesize mel-spectrograms containing detailed speech content and speaker identity characteristics.- Experiments show their method outperforms previous video-to-speech methods in quality metrics like word error rate, without requiring reference audio. The synthesized speech also subjectively sounds more natural and matches the speaker's voice better.So in summary, the key hypothesis is that using vision-guided speaker embeddings and a diffusion model can enable high quality video-to-speech synthesis without reference audio during inference. The results seem to validate this hypothesis and show improvements over previous approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It proposes a novel vision-guided speaker embedding extractor using a pre-trained model and prompt tuning. This allows rich speaker embedding information to be produced solely from visual input, without needing extra audio information during inference.- It presents a new diffusion-based video-to-speech synthesis model called DiffV2S, conditioned on the vision-guided speaker embeddings and visual features from the input video. This model can maintain phoneme details from the input while creating an intelligible mel-spectrogram that preserves speaker identities. - It is the first work to utilize a diffusion model for video-to-speech synthesis. The DiffV2S model generates detailed mel-spectrograms that lead to noise-free audio waveforms.- Experiments show the proposed method outperforms previous video-to-speech techniques on large audio-visual datasets. It produces speech with better content quality and voice matching to the original speaker.In summary, the key contribution is developing a video-to-speech model incorporating novel techniques of vision-guided speaker embeddings and conditional diffusion to generate high quality and detailed speech from silent video input alone. The proposed innovations for extracting speaker information from visuals and leveraging diffusion models significantly advance the state-of-the-art in this field.
