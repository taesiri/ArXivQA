# [Efficient Pre-training for Localized Instruction Generation of Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15964)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel technique called Sieve-\&-Swap to curate a high-quality, smaller-scale dataset for pre-training procedural learning models with limited computation budgets. It combines cooking videos from HowTo100M with text-only recipes from RecipeNLG using a pipeline that first pairs related videos and recipes based on title similarity. Then it employs sentence embeddings to filter irrelevant video transcripts and replace relevant ones with human-written instructions from recipes, bridging the gap between noisy web transcripts and downstream datasets. The resulting curated dataset, Sieve-\&-Swap HowToCook (SnS-HTC), is 48K videos yet leads to dramatic improvements. The paper also proposes the Procedure Transformer (ProcX) model for joint step localization and coherent instruction generation in procedural videos. ProcX utilizes several enhancements like key-aware deformable attention and a contrastive transformer module. When pre-trained on SnS-HTC then finetuned, ProcX with 3 orders of magnitude less pre-training data than prior work achieves new state-of-the-art results on YouCook2 and Tasty datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Sieve-\&-Swap technique and model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient approach called Sieve-&-Swap to automatically curate a high-quality multimodal dataset for pre-training procedural learning models by filtering irrelevant transcripts from instructional videos and replacing them with human-written instructions from text recipes, and introduces a Procedure Transformer model (ProcX) that achieves state-of-the-art performance for step localization and instruction generation when pre-trained on this dataset.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors propose a novel approach called "Sieve-\&-Swap" to curate a smaller, high-quality dataset for pre-training procedural learning models. This involves filtering irrelevant video transcripts and replacing them with human-written instructions from a text recipe dataset. 

2. The authors develop a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) model with several enhancements such as key-aware deformable attention, contrastive transformer module, and an IoU-aware confidence loss. ProcX achieves new state-of-the-art results on two instructional video datasets - YouCook2 and Tasty.

3. The authors introduce a curated dataset called SnS-HowToCook (SnS-HTC) for pre-training procedural learning models. With only 48K videos, SnS-HTC enables effective pre-training and delivers superior performance compared to methods that use much larger datasets. This allows efficient training of large models.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) Sieve-\&-Swap data curation technique, (2) Procedure Transformer model, and (3) SnS-HowToCook dataset for efficient pre-training. The proposed methods advance the state-of-the-art in instructional video understanding.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset curation technique called "Sieve & Swap". Can you explain in detail the two main steps of this technique and how they help bridge the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks? 

2. The Procedure Transformer (ProcX) model builds upon the PDVC model. What are the main architecture enhancements introduced in ProcX over PDVC, especially regarding the caption generation module?

3. The paper introduces a new attention mechanism called Key-Aware Deformable Attention. How does this differ from vanilla deformable attention and why is it beneficial for multi-scale feature learning in videos?

4. What is the Contrastive Transformer module in ProcX and what objective does it optimize? How does this improve upon standard transformer models for instruction generation? 

5. Explain the issue with confidence score estimation in PDVC and how the proposed IoU-aware Confidence Score (gVFL) helps mitigate that. 

6. What are the practical challenges of training an end-to-end transformer model from scratch? How does ProcX address model initialization and stability during training?

7. The multi-scale fusion incorporates a simple summation. What are the potential limitations of this design choice? Could hierarchical recursive fusion be more effective?

8. During pre-training, the paper uses MIL-InfoNCE loss instead of standard InfoNCE. What assumptions make this necessary and what changes during fine-tuning?

9. The results show ProcX surpassing SOTA with far fewer pre-training videos. Analyze the tradeoffs between model scale, dataset scale and compute requirements. 

10. Besides cooking, what other domains could the Sieve & Swap technique be applicable? Would it generalize easily or would significant dataset curation effort be needed?
