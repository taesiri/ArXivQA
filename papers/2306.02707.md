# [Orca: Progressive Learning from Complex Explanation Traces of GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on a quick skim of the paper, it seems the central research question is: How can smaller language models be trained to better mimic the capabilities of large foundation models (LFMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4? The paper discusses challenges with existing methods for instruction tuning smaller models to imitate LFMs, such as limited task diversity in the training data, shallow imitation signals from the LFM outputs, and difficulties in rigorous evaluation. To address these issues, the proposed approach involves using richer supervision signals from the LFM (explanations and reasoning chains), more diverse and complex training data, and more rigorous benchmarks for evaluating model capabilities beyond just text generation.The central hypothesis appears to be that learning from detailed reasoning explanations from humans or more advanced AI systems can significantly improve the quality of smaller models, helping them better acquire the skills and capabilities of powerful foundation models. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposed approach and evaluation of their model, Orca.In summary, the central research question is how to train smaller models to better mimic large foundation models, with the hypothesis that learning from detailed reasoning chains/explanations is an effective approach for alignment. The paper presents Orca as a case study and benchmarking to test this hypothesis.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it does not appear to have a clearly stated central research question or hypothesis. The paper seems to be presenting a new model called Orca, which is trained to mimic the reasoning and generation capabilities of large foundation models like GPT-4. The key ideas presented in the paper are:- Existing instruction-tuned models like Vicuna can match the style of large foundation models (LFMs) like GPT-4, but they lag behind in reasoning skills. - The authors propose a new technique called "explanation tuning" to train the Orca model to mimic GPT-4's reasoning process using step-by-step explanations.- Orca is trained on a large and diverse dataset of 5 million prompts answered by ChatGPT, plus 1 million prompts answered by GPT-4.- Orca is evaluated on a variety of reasoning tasks and shown to outperform models like Vicuna, while reaching near parity with ChatGPT on certain benchmarks.However, there is no formal research question or hypothesis stated. The paper seems focused on presenting the Orca model itself, the explanation tuning method, and benchmarking its capabilities relative to other models. The central premise appears to be showing that explanation tuning can help smaller models like Orca learn reasoning skills from large foundation models, but this is not framed as a distinct hypothesis to be tested.In summary, while this paper makes important contributions, it does not seem to have a clearly defined central research question or hypothesis. The key focus is on introducing and evaluating the Orca model trained via explanation tuning.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Orca, a 13 billion parameter language model trained via a novel technique called Explanation Tuning. Explanation Tuning involves training the model on rich signals from a foundation model teacher, beyond just the prompt and response. Specifically, Orca is trained on detailed step-by-step explanations from GPT-4 in response to prompts sampled from the diverse FLAN-v2 task collection. Compared to prior work on instruction tuning smaller models like Alpaca and Vicuna, Orca demonstrates stronger reasoning and comprehension skills when evaluated on benchmarks like BigBench Hard, AGIEval and SAT-style exams. On these tests of sophisticated reasoning, Orca significantly outperforms other smaller models, while rivaling proprietary foundation models like ChatGPT and in some cases even exceeding it. The authors posit Explanation Tuning as a promising direction for not just imitating foundation models, but also learning complex skills from their detailed thought process. However, there remains a performance gap compared to GPT-4, indicating room for improvement.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents Orca, a 13 billion parameter language model that is trained to imitate the reasoning capabilities of large foundation models (LFMs) like GPT-4. The key idea is to use detailed explanations from GPT-4 to provide additional signals to Orca during training, beyond just the prompt-response pairs used in typical instruction tuning. This "explanation tuning" allows Orca to better mimic GPT-4's reasoning process. The authors construct a large and diverse training set by sampling prompts from the FLAN dataset and collecting detailed explanations from GPT-4. Orca is first trained on 5 million examples with ChatGPT explanations, then further trained on 1 million examples with GPT-4 explanations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate Orca's strong performance on language generation and complex reasoning tasks. On average, Orca retains 95% of ChatGPT quality and 85% of GPT-4 quality as judged by GPT-4 itself. It also reaches near parity with ChatGPT on challenging benchmarks like BigBench-Hard that require sophisticated reasoning and inference. The results highlight the promise of learning from explanatory signals to improve reasoning capabilities.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper presents Orca, a 13 billion parameter language model trained via explanation tuning to mimic the reasoning abilities of large foundation models like GPT-4. The key method used is explanation tuning, where the model is trained on a large and diverse dataset of instructions augmented with detailed explanations from GPT-4. Specifically, the training data contains around 5 million instructions queried to ChatGPT along with detailed step-by-step reasoning, and 1 million additional instructions queried to GPT-4. The inputs consist of a system message providing guidelines for the desired response, a user query/instruction, and the teacher model's (GPT-4) explanatory response. This allows Orca to learn from rich signals beyond just input-output pairs, enabling it to better mimic GPT-4's reasoning process. The training data incorporates complex chains of reasoning elicited using carefully designed system instructions. Through this explanation tuning approach on large-scale diverse data, Orca is able to attain strong reasoning and comprehension capabilities compared to prior work, achieving parity with ChatGPT on complex benchmarks like BigBench Hard and outperforming other models by over 40% on exams in AGIEval. The method demonstrates that by learning from step-by-step explanations, smaller models can substantially improve their reasoning skills.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Based on my reading of the paper, the main method used can be summarized as follows:The paper proposes a new approach for explanation tuning to train smaller language models to mimic the reasoning process of large foundation models (LFMs) like GPT-4. The key idea is to leverage rich signals from LFMs beyond just the final generated text, specifically explanations that trace the step-by-step reasoning behind the LFM's response. To obtain such explanations, the authors craft diverse system instructions that guide the LFM to generate responses explaining its reasoning in detail. The system instructions request the LFM to "think step-by-step", "justify each step", or "explain like I'm five years old". The authors then use a large and diverse collection of tasks sampled from the FLAN dataset, augmented with the system instructions, to query the LFM. This generates training data that contains the task description, system instruction, LFM's step-by-step reasoning explanation, and final response. The smaller student model is then trained on this data using regular supervised learning, with the objective of mimicking the LFM's reasoning process traced in the explanation, in addition to the final response. The authors demonstrate significant gains over standard instruction tuning on benchmarks requiring sophisticated reasoning like BigBench and AGIEval. Overall, this explanation tuning approach allows smaller models to learn complex reasoning skills from LFMs more effectively than just imitating final responses.
