 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new hierarchical federated learning algorithm called QHetFed that employs quantization for communication efficiency, combines intra-set gradient and inter-set model parameter aggregation, analyzes convergence considering data heterogeneity, compares analytically to a baseline hierarchical method, optimizes system parameters based on convergence rate, and demonstrates superior accuracy especially under heterogeneous data distributions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new hierarchical federated learning algorithm called QHetFed that combines intra-set gradient aggregation and inter-set model aggregation to be robust against statistical heterogeneity. It also incorporates quantization for communication efficiency.

2. It provides a comprehensive analytical framework to evaluate the optimality gap and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm, parametrized by a data heterogeneity metric. This allows analyzing the impact of statistical heterogeneity. The analysis is also applied to a conventional hierarchical FL algorithm for comparison. 

3. It formulates an optimization problem to derive optimal values for the intra-set iterations and local gradient steps in closed-form, by minimizing the error term in the convergence rate under a runtime deadline constraint.
