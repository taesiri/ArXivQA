# [Personalized Text Generation with Fine-Grained Linguistic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04914)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Personalized Text Generation with Fine-Grained Linguistic Control":

Problem:
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled high-quality text generation capabilities. However, most research focuses on controlling high-level/coarse-grained attributes of generated text like formality, domain, sentiment. 
- It remains unclear how effective LLMs are at reflecting fine-grained linguistic style differences like lexical, syntactic and discourse patterns when generating personalized text.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs on generating personalized text based on fine-grained linguistic attributes spanning multiple dimensions.
- Extract lexical (readability, #tokens), syntactic (#POS tags) and discourse (#rhetorical relations) features from text of 251 authors to represent their writing style. 
- Discretize continuous feature values into bins to reduce sparsity and help models learn better representations.
- Evaluate ability of models like GPT-3.5 and Pythia to generate text adhering to provided fine-grained style vectors.
- Propose prefix-tuning method to incorporate style vectors into models during training.

Key Contributions:
- Novel benchmark for personalized text generation using fine-grained linguistic control
- Analysis of linguistic style differences between authors using lexical, syntactic and discourse features
- Evaluation of various baseline LLMs on benchmark and insights into their capabilities
- Proposed prefix-tuning method to improve personalized text generation by conditioning on style vectors

Overall, the paper introduces a new testbed to assess how sensitive LLMs are to fine-grained linguistic attributes during personalized generation. It provides analysis into current model capabilities through new metrics and datasets as well as suggestions to improve personalization.
