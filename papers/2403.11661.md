## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem and Scope:
- The paper studies periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems in the convex case. Specifically, it considers the boundary value problem of finding T-periodic solutions to Hamiltonian systems of the form x'(t) = JH'(t,x(t)) with convex Hamiltonian H going to infinity as ||x|| goes to infinity.

Main Contributions:
- Gives conditions for existence of non-constant T-periodic solutions when H is autonomous and (A_infty,B_infty)-subquadratic. This is based on a dual action minimization.
- For H that is C2 and (a_infty,b_infty)-subquadratic with isolated equilibria, gives precise condition (equation 2eq:three) on T for existence of non-constant periodic solutions via dual action minimization. 
- Shows that when H''(x) is non-degenerate, local minimizers of the dual action have minimal period T.
- Extends the existence results on subharmonics from earlier works to the convex subquadratic setting.

Proposed Methodology:
- Uses a dual action approach to convert the Hamiltonian system boundary value problem into an equivalent dual minimization problem. This allows exploiting convexity properties of the Hamiltonian.
- Applies variational and minimax principles combined with index theory for periodic solutions to derive existence results.
- Makes heavy use of convex analysis techniques.

Overall, the paper derives several new existence and non-triviality results for periodic solutions to convex Hamiltonian systems under different growth conditions on H, significantly extending previous work. The results rely on converting the problem to an equivalent dual minimization problem using convex duality.
