# Dual Semantic Knowledge Composed Multimodal Dialog Systems

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to improve textual response generation in multimodal task-oriented dialog systems by better utilizing knowledge and representations?Specifically, the paper identifies two main limitations of prior work:1) Ignoring relation knowledge beyond just attribute knowledge in the knowledge base. 2) Lacking representation-level regularization between the context-knowledge composed response and the ground truth response.To address these limitations, the central hypothesis appears to be that incorporating both attribute and relation knowledge from the knowledge base, and adding representation-level regularization, will improve the textual response generation performance of multimodal dialog systems.The paper proposes a new model called MDS-S^2 that incorporates these ideas through:- Dual semantic knowledge acquisition to get both attribute and relation knowledge - Multi-level knowledge composition to integrate the knowledge- Representation-regularized response generation with regularization between composed and ground truth response representationsExperiments are then conducted to evaluate whether the proposed MDS-S^2 model outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, validating the core research hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to better utilize knowledge and representations to improve textual response generation in multimodal dialog systems, which is addressed through the proposed MDS-S^2 model.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a novel multimodal dialog system (named MDS-S^2) for textual response generation in task-oriented dialog systems. 2. It acquires both attribute and relation knowledge from the knowledge base to enhance the response generation. The relation knowledge is extracted by n-hop graph walk, which is a novel technique explored in this paper.3. It composes the acquired dual knowledge (attribute and relation knowledge) with the multimodal context at multiple levels - token level for attribute knowledge and representation level for relation knowledge. This multi-level composition is designed considering that the two knowledge types can facilitate responding to different levels of questions.4. It incorporates representation-level semantic regularization between the composed response and ground truth response, in addition to the commonly used output-level supervision. This regularization helps guide the composed response representation learning. 5. It proposes a semantic-enhanced decoder that can utilize the regularized composed response semantic representation to further improve the textual response generation.6. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, especially the dual knowledge composition and representation regularization. The codes and parameters are released to facilitate future research.In summary, the main highlights are the novel dual knowledge composition, multi-level composition framework, and representation-level regularization for improving textual response generation in multimodal task-oriented dialog systems. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model MDS-S^2.
