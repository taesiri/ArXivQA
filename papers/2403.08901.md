# [A Framework for Strategic Discovery of Credible Neural Network Surrogate   Models under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08901)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural network surrogate models of high-fidelity physical simulations face challenges due to data limitations and difficulty balancing model complexity. In particular:
    1) Data uncertainty leads to overfitting and overconfidence
    2) Existing validation approaches rely too much on asymptotic guarantees  
    3) Model selection is difficult with many choices of architectures/hyperparameters
- There is a need for robust uncertainty quantification and credibility assessment to ensure reliability when deployed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces the Occam Plausibility Algorithm for Surrogate Models (OPAL-surrogate), a systematic framework to identify predictive Bayesian neural network (BayesNN) surrogate models.

- It utilizes hierarchical Bayesian inferences to determine distributions of network parameters and compare models based on an evidence/plausibility measure.

- Validation tests assess model credibility. The framework balances tradeoffs between accuracy, uncertainty and complexity.

- A network sparsification method is proposed to capture multiscale structure, involving adding layers then pruning weights.

Main Contributions:  
- Formulation of surrogate modeling problem using evidence framework and hierarchical modeling
- Introduction of OPAL-surrogate for discovering credible BayesNN surrogate models
    - Employs Bayesian validation tests for credibility assessment
    - Balances model complexity, uncertainty and accuracy
    - Uses sparsification guided by evidence to reveal multiscale structure
- Demonstration on two numerical examples:
    1) Elastic deformation of porous materials
    2) Combustion flow modeling  
- Framework highlights need for model validation despite limited data, and complexity guided by domain knowledge

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions regarding the methodology for systematically developing and validating reliable BayesNN surrogate models for multiscale physical systems.
