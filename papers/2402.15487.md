## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "RoboEXP: Action-Conditioned Scene Graph via Interactive Exploration for Robotic Manipulation":

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenge of enabling robots to autonomously explore unknown environments in order to construct a complete understanding of all objects, including those that are concealed or obstructed. Prior work in robotic exploration has focused primarily on changing viewpoints for mapping or simple interactions with limited categories of objects. The paper introduces the novel task of "interactive scene exploration" where the goal is to efficiently identify all objects, even those requiring manipulation to be revealed. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper presents RoboEXP, an interactive robotic exploration system for constructing "action-conditioned scene graphs" (ACSGs) which represent objects, actions to reveal objects, and their interactive relationships. The key components of RoboEXP include:

1) A perception module that detects objects and extracts visual features using state-of-the-art models.  

2) A memory module that merges observations over time into a 3D ACSG, updating it incrementally.

3) A decision module powered by large language models that proposes exploration actions and validates their feasibility.

4) An action module with robotic manipulation skills to interact with the environment.


In a closed-loop manner, RoboEXP perceives the scene, decides what action to take to reveal more objects, manipulates the environment, and updates the ACSG based on new observations after the interaction. This allows it to construct a complete ACSG even for complex multi-step scenarios like opening nested Matryoshka dolls.


Main Contributions:

1) Introduction of the novel problem of interactive scene exploration for manipulation-based revealing of all objects.

2) Proposal of action-conditioned scene graphs (ACSG) as a representation that models interactive relationships between objects and actions.

3) RoboEXP system demonstrating interactive exploration on a physical robot in various real-world environments involving rigid objects, articulated objects, nested dolls, and cloth.

4) Extensive experiments showing RoboEXP's ability to construct complete ACSGs and use them to efficiently facilitate complex downstream robotic manipulation tasks.

In summary, the paper presents a novel robotic exploration approach powered by deep learning and large language models to interactively construct action-conditioned scene graphs that allow manipulating previously concealed or obstructed objects, with demonstrated applications in real-world household/office settings.
