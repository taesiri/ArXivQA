# [Inherent Redundancy in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08227)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) What is the source of redundancy in spiking neural networks (SNNs) and why does it exist? 2) How can we reduce redundancy and optimize spike firing in SNNs to improve their efficiency and performance?3) Can a simple spatial attention mechanism help harness the inherent redundancy in SNNs by optimizing the membrane potential distribution?The key hypotheses seem to be:- Redundancy in SNNs is induced by their spatio-temporal invariance, which enhances parameter utilization efficiency but also invites redundant spike firing. - Optimizing the membrane potential distribution of SNN neurons can help reduce redundant spike firing and improve efficiency and accuracy.- A spatial attention module that modulates the membrane potential distribution can effectively harness SNN redundancy.The overall goal appears to be analyzing the sources of redundancy in SNNs, and using those insights to develop an efficient way to reduce redundant spike firing, thereby improving SNN performance and energy efficiency for deployment on neuromorphic hardware. The spatial attention module is proposed as a way to achieve this redundancy reduction and performance optimization in a simple and efficient manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents an analysis of inherent redundancy in spiking neural networks (SNNs) and proposes a method to reduce this redundancy. The key contributions are:1. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of redundancy in SNNs by investigating the relationship between spike firing and the spatio-temporal dynamics of spiking neurons. It identifies that redundancy arises from the spatio-temporal invariance of SNNs.2. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes an Advanced Spatial Attention (ASA) module to optimize the membrane potential distribution and reduce redundant spike firing in SNNs. The ASA module consists of channel separation and individual spatial attention on important and unimportant channels.3. Experiments on several event-based vision datasets demonstrate that the ASA module can significantly reduce spike counts (up to 78.9%) while improving accuracy compared to baseline SNNs. The performance gains are more noticeable for smaller SNN models.4. Comparisons show the ASA module is more cost-effective than other attention mechanisms for SNNs in terms of computation and performance.5. Analysis reveals how the ASA module changes the membrane potential distribution and spike patterns to reduce redundancy. The peak-to-threshold distance and variance of the distribution are identified as useful indicators.In summary, the key contribution is providing new insight into inherent redundancy of SNNs and an effective way to harness this redundancy through spatial attention to optimize membrane potential distribution. This could enable more accurate and energy-efficient SNNs for spike-based neuromorphic computing.
