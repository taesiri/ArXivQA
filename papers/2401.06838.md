# [MAPO: Advancing Multilingual Reasoning through Multilingual   Alignment-as-Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06838)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing large language models (LLMs) exhibit inconsistent reasoning abilities across different languages. Reasoning in English is superior compared to other languages due to imbalance in multilingual training data.  
- Methods like supervised fine-tuning (SFT) suffer from insufficient high-quality multilingual reasoning data, translation errors, catastrophic forgetting and poor out-of-domain generalization.
- Enhancing reasoning abilities in non-English languages remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose a multilingual alignment-as-preference optimization (MAPO) framework to enhance reasoning in non-English languages by aligning them to English reasoning.
- Use a translation model to estimate consistency between non-English and English answers as preference scores. Higher scores indicate more aligned reasoning processes.
- Optimize this preference alignment using Distillation-guided Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

Key Contributions:
- Achieves 13.7% accuracy improvement on out-of-domain MSVAMP dataset, while preserving performance on in-domain MGSM dataset.
- Iterative DPO further improves multilingual mathematical reasoning alignment and achieves 16.7% improvement.
- Analysis shows the framework effectively aligns reasoning across languages leading to accuracy gains. Robust across varying sizes of translation models.
- Establishes new state-of-the-art in multilingual reasoning over models like ChatGPT and MathOctopus across 3 evaluation benchmarks.

In summary, the paper proposes an alignment-based preference optimization framework to address inconsistent multilingual reasoning in LLMs. By aligning non-English to English reasoning, it achieves significant reasoning ability improvements in multiple languages especially out-of-domain, advancing multilingual LLM capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a multilingual alignment-as-preference optimization (MAPO) framework to improve the consistency and enhance the lesser reasoning abilities of large language models across languages by aligning non-pivot language reasoning processes to a dominant pivot language through preference estimation and optimization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel multilingual alignment-as-preference optimization (MAPO) framework to significantly enhance reasoning ability in non-pivot languages by aligning them with pivot languages. Specifically:

- They propose to use an open-source translation model to estimate alignment preferences between answers in non-pivot and pivot languages. Higher alignment indicates more consistent reasoning with the pivot language. 

- They adopt state-of-the-art preference optimization methods (PPO and DPO) to optimize the alignment scores as preferences, thereby improving the lesser reasoning abilities in non-pivot languages. 

- Experiments show their method effectively improves reasoning consistency across languages, achieving a 13.7% accuracy improvement on out-of-domain datasets. Iterative DPO can further push the improvement to 16.7%.

- Analysis confirms that enhancing alignment through their method is key to improving multilingual reasoning capabilities.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the MAPO framework to enhance multilingual reasoning by optimizing alignment preferences estimated from a translation model. This is shown to improve consistency and accuracy across languages, especially for non-pivot languages.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Multilingual reasoning - The paper focuses on improving the reasoning abilities of language models across multiple languages.

- Alignment-as-preference optimization (MAPO) - This is the proposed framework to enhance reasoning in non-pivot languages by aligning them to a pivot language.

- Preference estimation - Estimating consistency between answers in non-pivot and pivot languages as a preference measure.

- Preference optimization - Optimizing the model using the estimated preference, through methods like DPO and PPO. 

- Iterative DPO - Conducting multiple rounds of preference optimization using DPO to further improve alignment and reasoning abilities.

- Multilingual alignment - Aligning the reasoning process and answers in non-pivot languages to those in the pivot language (English).

- Reasoning consistency - Measuring the similarity in the reasoning process and answers across languages.

- Out-of-domain generalization - Evaluating how well the improved reasoning abilities generalize to out-of-domain test data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes an alignment-as-preference optimization (MAPO) framework. Can you explain in more detail how the alignment scores are calculated between pivot and non-pivot languages? What translation model is used and what metrics are calculated to represent the alignment?

2. The paper adopts both PPO and DPO for preference optimization. Can you compare and contrast these two methods? What are the differences in how they utilize the alignment preferences during optimization? 

3. The paper finds that iterative DPO leads to further improvements in multilingual reasoning abilities. What is the intuition behind this? How does additional rounds of sampling and optimization based on updated policies lead to better alignment?

4. The ablation study shows the method is robust to translation models of different scales. What factors contribute to this robustness? Would you expect the scale of the translation model to have no impact on the final reasoning abilities?

5. Could you discuss potential limitations or weaknesses of using translation probability to estimate reasoning alignment across languages? What assumptions does this make and when might they not hold?  

6. The method relies on English as a pivot language for alignment. Could the approach be extended to utilize multiple pivot languages simultaneously? What considerations would need to be made?

7. The paper hypothesizes that reasoning is language agnostic. Do you think this fully holds based on the analysis? What evidence suggests reasoning diverges across languages and where does alignment break down?

8. How suitable do you think the MAPO framework would be for more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks compared to the mathematical problems studied? Would additional modifications or training paradigms be necessary?

9. The analysis shows improved overlap between correctly solved problems across languages. Does this indicate the model has learned to better ground concepts and semantics in a language agnostic way? What further analysis could be done to test this? 

10. The method does not require parallel data or annotation of reasoning processes. What are other potential semi-supervised or self-supervised ways alignment preferences could be generated to further improve multilingual reasoning?
