# [FinTral: A Family of GPT-4 Level Multimodal Financial Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10986)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: Applying NLP models in finance faces challenges due to complex financial language, scarce annotated data, models' limited inferential capabilities, and the need for real-time analysis. Models also struggle with processing numerical data and visual content like graphs and figures commonly found in financial documents.  

Proposed Solution: The paper introduces FinTral, a multimodal large language model tailored for financial analysis. FinTral integrates textual, numerical, tabular and visual data processing through a combination of domain-specific pretraining, instruction tuning using specialized financial reasoning datasets, and alignment with AI feedback using reinforcement learning.

Main Contributions:

1) FinSet - An extensive 20B token financial dataset for pretraining and a comprehensive benchmark covering 9 tasks over 25 datasets for evaluation, including analysis of model hallucinations.

2) FinTral Models - A suite of financial LLMs building on top of Mistral-7B, enhanced via domain pretraining, instruction tuning and alignment with GPT-4 responses using direct policy optimization. Key versions introduced are FinTral-INST, FinTral-DPO, FinTral-VL (with visual capabilities), and FinTral-DPO-T\&R (integrating tools and retrieval).

3) Performance - FinTral models demonstrate strong capabilities, outperforming ChatGPT on all tasks and surpassing GPT-4 on over half the text-based tasks. FinTral-DPO-T\&R combines accuracy and practical utility for real-time finance applications. Analysis also includes comparisons on chart understanding and hallucination measurement using specialized evaluation datasets.

4) Applications - Discussion highlights FinTral's potential for excelling in diverse real-time finance settings encompassing analysis, decision making and content generation. Responsible development and deployment practices are also emphasized.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing multimodal LLMs specialized for finance via tailored training strategies, extensive evaluation benchmarking, strong empirical performance surpassing existing models, and promising real-world application potential.
