# [Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12726)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is whether it is possible to specialize smaller language models to achieve improved performance on targeted reasoning abilities, such as multi-step math reasoning via chain-of-thought prompting. Specifically, the paper investigates whether smaller language models (<= 10B parameters) can emulate the strong chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities exhibited by very large models (100B+ parameters) through a process of "model specialization". The hypothesis is that large models have strong but general modeling power spread over many tasks, while smaller models with limited capacity can concentrate their capacity on a specific target task and achieve decent improved performance on that task. The paper focuses on multi-step math reasoning as a testbed for studying this hypothesis of specializing smaller models towards particular reasoning abilities. The overarching goal is to understand how to improve the parameter efficiency and accessibility of powerful large language models by transferring their capabilities to smaller specialized models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. Showing that chain-of-thought reasoning ability for math word problems can be improved in smaller language models (~10B parameters or less) through a process of "model specialization". This challenges the previous belief that chain-of-thought reasoning only emerges in very large models (100B+ parameters).2. Demonstrating a tradeoff between general reasoning abilities and specialized math reasoning abilities when specializing smaller models. The paper shows that as models are specialized on math reasoning, they lose performance on generic reasoning tasks like those in the BigBench benchmark. 3. Providing an analysis of the model specialization process, including how in-distribution vs out-of-distribution performance evolves during training, and the differences between starting from a raw pretrained checkpoint vs an instruction-tuned checkpoint.4. Introducing techniques like dynamic programming alignment of tokenizers and model selection based on multiple datasets to improve specialization and generalization. 5. Showing that after specialization, smaller models exhibit log-linear scaling curves on math reasoning similar to large models, rather than the flat scaling curves previously observed, suggesting chain-of-thought reasoning may not be an "emergent" ability exclusive to large models.In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that specialized smaller models can attain improved reasoning abilities on targeted tasks like math word problems, at the expense of general reasoning skills. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of this specialization process and tradeoffs involved.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes specializing smaller language models towards improved multi-step math reasoning ability through knowledge distillation from large models, showing ability tradeoffs and log-linear scaling curves.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper on specializing smaller language models for multi-step reasoning compares to other related work:- It focuses specifically on improving multi-step reasoning abilities in smaller LMs (<10B parameters), whereas much prior work has focused on emergent reasoning abilities in large LMs (100B+ parameters). - The approach of "model specialization" is similar to knowledge distillation and transfer learning, but the paper emphasizes trading off generic abilities to concentrate model capacity on a target skill.- It shows specialized smaller LMs can match the performance of some much larger generic LMs on math reasoning tasks, while losing performance on more general reasoning tasks. This demonstrates ability tradeoffs.- The paper studies the effect of specialization over the full training process, showing how in-distribution vs out-of-distribution performance trade off over time. Most prior work looks at end results.- It examines the impact of different base model choices (raw pretrained vs instruction-tuned checkpoints) and data formats (in-context vs zero-shot) on specialization.- The results modify beliefs about scaling laws for emergent abilities like reasoning, showing specialized smaller LMs exhibit more gradual log-linear improvement akin to large LMs.- The techniques for aligning tokenizers and matching output distributions for knowledge transfer seem novel compared to prior distillation methods.Overall, this paper provides new insights into ability tradeoffs in LMs and how to productively specialize smaller models, advancing the state-of-the-art in an important direction. The analysis over full training trajectories and careful design choices are strengths.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Studying how to better generalize specialized models beyond their training data. The authors note that small models may simply overfit to the training distribution but struggle to generalize well when the distribution shifts. Developing techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization for specialized models is an important direction.- Integrating complementary techniques like adding calculators or self-consistency decoding into the model specialization process. The authors mention these techniques are orthogonal and could likely improve performance further. Exploring how to effectively combine them with model specialization is suggested.- Releasing implementations of useful techniques like the sequence alignment algorithm for handling mismatched tokenizers. The authors plan to release their tokenizer alignment code and note this could aid future research.- Exploring specialization for a wider range of model sizes, tasks, and domains beyond just math reasoning. The authors frame their work as an initial attempt at specialized smaller models that could motivate more research across other areas.- Studying other tradeoffs between model abilities, like between few-shot and zero-shot learning. The authors show tradeoffs between in-context and zero-shot abilities, suggesting more work on characterizing tradeoffs.- Using different sources of data for specialization, like human annotations. The authors note they use distillation for specialization but other data sources could also be effective.- Comparing specialization to simply finetuning on task-specific data, to better understand the differences. The authors suggest this ablation study.In general, the authors position their work on specializing smaller models for math reasoning as an early attempt that could open up a new research direction on specialized models to complement large generic ones. The above seem like logical next steps suggested based on their initial findings.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper studies how to improve multi-step reasoning abilities like chain-of-thought math reasoning in smaller language models. It shows that by specializing smaller models like FlanT5 towards a target reasoning task through distillation from a large teacher model like GPT-3.5, the smaller models can concentrate their limited capacity and emulate strong reasoning capabilities on that task. This comes at the cost of decreased performance on more generic tasks, reflecting a trade-off between broad and specialized abilities. The specialized smaller models exhibit better scaling behavior and outperform prior distillation approaches. The study provides insights into training specialized smaller models and balancing different model abilities. It demonstrates the potential to equip smaller models with strong reasoning in targeted domains, broadening access to such capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper studies how to improve the chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning ability of smaller language models through model specialization. The authors fine-tune smaller models like FlanT5 using CoT data distilled from the large GPT-3.5 teacher model. They show this specialization sacrifices the models' generic reasoning abilities, measured by BigBench Hard performance, but substantially lifts their CoT reasoning accuracy on math word problems. Specialized FlanT5 models achieve over 10% average gains on CoT math datasets including in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. At 11B parameters, specialized FlanT5 matches 137B LaMDA and 60B PaLM on CoT math reasoning. Specialization transforms small models' previously near-flat CoT scaling curves into continuous log-linear ones, suggesting CoT is not an exclusively emergent ability of large models. The paper reveals tradeoffs between generic and specialized abilities, in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, and in-context learning vs zero-shot reasoning. It provides insights into specialized smaller models in the era of large language models.In summary, the paper demonstrates specialized smaller models can attain strong chain-of-thought reasoning abilities in a target domain like math by sacrificing generic skills. The specialization approach transforms small models' scaling behavior and generalization. The work reveals ability tradeoffs and provides an initial case study on concentrating smaller models' capacity through specialization, contributing to the understanding and development of smaller yet capable models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes specializing smaller language models towards improved performance on multi-step math reasoning through chain-of-thought prompting. The key method is to fine-tune an instruction-tuned model (FlanT5) by distilling chain-of-thought reasoning paths generated by a large teacher model (GPT-3.5) on the GSM8K math reasoning dataset. The distilled FlanT5 models are evaluated on GSM8K and 3 additional out-of-distribution math reasoning datasets. Model selection is done based on average performance on the out-of-distribution datasets rather than just GSM8K to improve generalization. The tradeoff is analyzed between improved math reasoning performance versus decreased performance on the BigBench benchmark which measures generic reasoning ability. Overall, the method concentrates model capacity from generic abilities towards specialized multi-step math reasoning.

Based on my reading, the key points about the problem and research questions addressed in this paper are:- Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) with over 100B parameters exhibit surprising abilities like multi-step reasoning when provided with chains of thought (CoT) as prompts. However, smaller models do not seem to have such "emergent" abilities. - The paper wants to study if smaller models can also be specialized to have improved multi-step reasoning abilities, in particular for math word problems, through a process of model specialization. - The key research questions seem to be:  - Can model specialization concentrate the power of smaller models (≤10B params) to improve their performance on a target task like math CoT reasoning?   - What is the tradeoff - do models lose some generic reasoning skills by specializing on a particular task?  - How does specialization change the scaling curve of smaller models - does it lift the performance from a flat curve to a log-linear curve?  - What design choices (base model selection, data formats etc.) are important for effective specialization?- Overall, the paper wants to demonstrate specialized smaller models can attain some emergent abilities like math reasoning that were previously thought to only exist in large 100B+ models. And it aims to provide insights into model specialization approaches and tradeoffs.
