# [Knowledge-aware Alert Aggregation in Large-scale Cloud Systems: a Hybrid   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06485)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Modern cloud systems can trigger an "alert storm", where many correlated alerts are fired due to a single root cause failure. This overwhelms engineers and makes it difficult to resolve issues efficiently. Existing alert aggregation methods have limitations - semantic similarity methods ignore causal rationale of alerts, while statistical methods cannot handle infrequent alerts well. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes \frnm, a novel hybrid approach for online alert aggregation, comprising of:

1) Correlation mining module: Efficiently captures temporal (co-occurrence in time windows) and spatial (propagation sequence based on service topology) correlations between alerts with high confidence. 

2) LLM reasoning module: Leverages large language models (LLMs) to reason about uncertain alert pairs using knowledge from Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Applies in-context learning using historical examples and rules to provide domain knowledge to LLM. Also employs supervised fine-tuning of LLM to learn parameters for the alert aggregation task.

The hybrid design combines the efficiency of correlation mining for frequent alerts, and reasoning capability of LLM for uncertain alerts, ensuring efficiency for large volumes of alerts.

Main Contributions:

- First to introduce detailed SOP knowledge for more effective alert aggregation, allowing reasoning for semantically dissimilar or infrequent alerts

- Novel hybrid \frnm framework specifically designed for online alert aggregation, combining strengths of correlation mining and LLM reasoning

- Extensive evaluation on real-world data from Huawei Cloud demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in alert aggregation and comparable efficiency

- Sharing practical deployment experience of \frnm on production environment of commercial cloud provider

In summary, the paper presents a knowledge-driven, hybrid approach for efficient and accurate online alert aggregation in cloud systems. By correlating alerts across services and layers, it can help engineers resolve failures faster.
