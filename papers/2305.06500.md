# InstructBLIP: Towards General-purpose Vision-Language Models with   Instruction Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we build an effective general-purpose vision-language model that can follow natural language instructions to solve a wide variety of visual tasks, including those not seen during training?The key hypothesis is that by performing comprehensive vision-language instruction tuning on a diverse set of tasks framed as instructions, the model can learn to effectively follow new instructions and generalize to unseen tasks and data distributions. In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates the InstructBLIP framework which performs instruction tuning on top of pre-trained BLIP models. Through techniques like instruction-aware visual feature extraction and balanced dataset sampling, InstructBLIP demonstrates strong generalization on a wide range of held-out vision-language tasks and datasets.So in summary, the central research question is how to create a generalized vision-language instruction following model, and the key hypothesis is that broad and diverse instruction tuning can enable such generalization capability. The InstructBLIP framework is proposed and evaluated as a way to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Here are the main contributions of this paper:- The authors perform a comprehensive and systematic study on vision-language instruction tuning using 26 datasets covering a diverse range of tasks. 13 datasets are used for held-in instruction tuning, and 13 are held out for zero-shot evaluation. - They propose an instruction-aware visual feature extraction mechanism that allows the model to extract flexible and informative visual features tailored to the given instruction text. This improves generalization across different tasks.- They evaluate and open-source InstructBLIP models based on two families of pretrained LLMs - FlanT5 and Vicuna. The models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on all 13 held-out datasets, significantly outperforming prior work like BLIP-2 and Flamingo.- The InstructBLIP models also serve as better initializations for finetuning on downstream tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results on datasets like ScienceQA, OCR-VQA, and A-OKVQA.- Qualitative examples demonstrate InstructBLIP's ability to perform complex reasoning, ground image descriptions in knowledge, and conduct multi-turn visual dialog.In summary, the main contribution is a comprehensive study and strong empirical results showing the effectiveness of instruction tuning for building generalized vision-language models that can solve a diverse range of tasks in a zero-shot setting. The proposed instruction-aware visual feature extraction is an important component of this.

Here is a summary of how this paper on InstructBLIP compares to other related work in vision-language instruction tuning:- This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic study on instruction tuning for vision-language models, transforming 26 datasets into instruction format across diverse tasks. Other works have used fewer datasets and task types.- The paper proposes an instruction-aware visual feature extraction method, where the instruction conditions the image features extraction in addition to the text generation. This is a novel technique not explored by other methods like BLIP-2, LLaVA, etc. - The paper evaluates InstructBLIP models of varying sizes and decoder-only vs encoder-decoder architectures. Most prior works focus on a single model configuration. - InstructBLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on all 13 held-out datasets, outperforming prior models like BLIP-2 and Flamingo by a large margin.- The paper provides an in-depth analysis on various aspects of vision-language instruction tuning, including comparisons to multitask learning and finetuning performance. This provides valuable insights beyond just reporting metrics.- InstructBLIP advances the state-of-the-art in general-purpose vision-language models that can follow arbitrary instructions. The systematic study and model innovations set a strong benchmark for future research in this direction.In summary, this paper provides significant contributions through the scale and rigor of the analysis, novel techniques introduced, thorough evaluation, and advancing the state-of-the-art for instruction-tuned vision-language models.
