# [InstructBLIP: Towards General-purpose Vision-Language Models with   Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06500)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my understanding, the central research question this paper aims to address is: 

How can we build an effective general-purpose vision-language model that can follow natural language instructions to solve a wide variety of visual tasks, including those not seen during training?

The key hypothesis is that by performing comprehensive vision-language instruction tuning on a diverse set of tasks framed as instructions, the model can learn to effectively follow new instructions and generalize to unseen tasks and data distributions. 

In particular, the paper proposes and evaluates the InstructBLIP framework which performs instruction tuning on top of pre-trained BLIP models. Through techniques like instruction-aware visual feature extraction and balanced dataset sampling, InstructBLIP demonstrates strong generalization on a wide range of held-out vision-language tasks and datasets.

So in summary, the central research question is how to create a generalized vision-language instruction following model, and the key hypothesis is that broad and diverse instruction tuning can enable such generalization capability. The InstructBLIP framework is proposed and evaluated as a way to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Here are the main contributions of this paper:

- The authors perform a comprehensive and systematic study on vision-language instruction tuning using 26 datasets covering a diverse range of tasks. 13 datasets are used for held-in instruction tuning, and 13 are held out for zero-shot evaluation. 

- They propose an instruction-aware visual feature extraction mechanism that allows the model to extract flexible and informative visual features tailored to the given instruction text. This improves generalization across different tasks.

## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main method used is instruction tuning of a multimodal vision-language model called InstructBLIP. Specifically, the authors perform comprehensive instruction tuning of InstructBLIP models on a diverse set of 26 publicly available vision-language datasets that are transformed into instruction format. These datasets cover 11 task categories such as image captioning, visual question answering, visual reasoning, etc. During instruction tuning, only the parameters of a Query Transformer module are finetuned while keeping the image encoder and large language model frozen. To enable the model to extract informative visual features tailored to the given instruction, the authors propose an instruction-aware Query Transformer design where the instruction text is provided as input to guide the extraction of image features. The trained InstructBLIP models achieve state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot evaluations across a range of held-out datasets as well as when finetuned on individual downstream tasks. In summary, the key method is comprehensive instruction tuning of multimodal models like InstructBLIP on diverse vision-language datasets to enable generalized zero-shot instruction following.
