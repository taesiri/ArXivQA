# [RAIN: Your Language Models Can Align Themselves without Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07124)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the central research question is whether large language models (LLMs) can be aligned to human preferences and safety goals without any additional training or finetuning, solely through modifications to the inference procedure. The key hypothesis appears to be that by integrating self-evaluation and rewinding mechanisms into the inference process, frozen LLMs can generate safer, more human-aligned responses compared to standard auto-regressive inference. Specifically, the self-evaluation allows the model to appraise its own generations, and the rewinding enables it to revise earlier tokens conditional on that evaluation.The authors introduce an inference approach called RAIN (Rewindable Auto-regressive INference) to test this hypothesis. RAIN alternates between forward generation and backward rewinding phases, guided by the model's self-evaluations. The goal is to show frozen LLMs can accomplish self-alignment without external data or model updates.So in summary, the central research question seems to be whether unfrozen LLMs can be aligned to human preferences through innovations to the inference procedure alone, which they test via the RAIN method. The key hypothesis is that self-evaluation and rewinding will allow for safer, human-aligned generations from frozen models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a novel inference method called RAIN (Rewindable Auto-regressive INference) that allows pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to align themselves with human preferences during inference without requiring any additional training or finetuning. Key points:- RAIN incorporates two main mechanisms - self-evaluation and rewinding - that allow the LLM to evaluate its own generations and make corrections by rewinding its internal state and regenerating. This mimics human behavior of contemplating and correcting oneself.- RAIN does not require any external human labeled data or model finetuning. The self-evaluation is guided by a fixed prompt that communicates the desired human preference.- Experiments show RAIN can significantly improve alignment on helpfulness, harmlessness, sentiment control tasks compared to vanilla autoregressive inference in large models like LLama, without hurting helpfulness.- RAIN also improves robustness against adversarial attacks, reducing attack success rate substantially on models like Vicuna.- The main advantage of RAIN is achieving alignment during inference in frozen large models, which avoids expensive finetuning or modifications to model parameters.In summary, the core contribution is presenting inference-time alignment in frozen LLMs via self-evaluation and rewinding as a practical and effective approach over existing finetuning methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on skimming through the paper, here is a one sentence TL;DR summary: The paper introduces RAIN, a novel inference method for large language models that allows them to align themselves with human preferences without any additional training data or model updates by incorporating self-evaluation and rewinding capabilities.
