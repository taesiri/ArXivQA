# [SNIFFER: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Out-of-Context   Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03170)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is a prevalent issue where authentic images are reused with false or misleading text to deceive audiences. Detecting such misinformation is challenging as the images are real while the deception stems from the contextual manipulation.  
- Existing methods focus on image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have potential for this task but may fail to follow instructions, misunderstand user intent, and hallucinate due to differences from their training data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Sniffer, an MLLM specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation through two-stage instruction tuning.  
- Stage 1 tunes the model to align concepts between images and fine-grained news entities. 
- Stage 2 leverages GPT-4 generated instruction data covering judgments and explanations to adapt the model to the OOC task.  
- Sniffer conducts internal checking for image-text consistency and external checking between text and retrieved evidence, integrated through the LLM module for a unified output.

Main Contributions:
- A data reformation pipeline to convert OOC samples into judgment and explanation instruction format using GPT-4 
- A practical tuning approach to adapt general MLLMs to the OOC detection task  
- Sniffer architecture conducting both internal and external verification for comprehensive reasoning 
- Extensive experiments showing Sniffer exceeds SOTA methods in both detection accuracy and explainability

In summary, the paper addresses key limitations of existing works through an innovatively engineered MLLM solution that sets the new state-of-the-art for out-of-context misinformation detection and explanation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Sniffer, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for detecting and explaining out-of-context misinformation by employing two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP and augmenting it with external knowledge through retrieval and tool usage.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors design a novel data reformation pipeline assisted by GPT-4 to convert given out-of-context (OOC) image-text pairs into an instruction-following format with judgments and explanations. 

2. They propose a practical approach to adapt existing general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for OOC misinformation detection through two-stage instruction tuning. Their task-specific MLLM, Sniffer, enhanced with external tools and retrieval, effectively models both internal image-text clues and external claim-evidence clues for simultaneous OOC detection and explanation.

3. Extensive experiments show that Sniffer significantly outperforms the original MLLM and state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. It also provides accurate and persuasive explanations validated by quantitative and human evaluations.

In summary, the key contribution is developing an explainable OOC misinformation detection model called Sniffer through task-specific tuning of MLLMs and integration of external knowledge. Sniffer achieves superior performance in both detection and explanation capabilities.

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs)  
- Instruction tuning
- Explainable AI
- Fact checking
- Fake news detection
- Image-text consistency
- Claim-evidence relevance
- Knowledge retrieval
- Visual reasoning

The paper focuses on detecting out-of-context misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text. It proposes a multimodal large language model called Sniffer that is specifically tuned for this task through a two-stage instruction tuning process. Sniffer provides both a judgment on the veracity of image-text pairs and an explanation for its decision, making it an explainable AI system. The paper evaluates Sniffer's ability to spot inconsistencies, utilize external knowledge, and generate accurate and persuasive explanations. Overall, the key themes are around adapting language models for explainable fake news and misinformation detection in a multimodal setting.
