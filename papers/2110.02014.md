# [Solving even-parity problems using traceless genetic programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Addressed
The paper proposes a new Genetic Programming (GP) variant called Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP) to evolve solutions for difficult Boolean even-parity problems. Even-parity problems are considered very challenging for blind random search methods. The paper argues that standard GP has difficulties scaling to solve higher-order even-parity problems.

Proposed Solution  
TGP is a hybrid technique combining a specialized representation and build mechanism for GP individuals along with custom genetic operators. The key idea in TGP is that it does not explicitly store the full evolved programs, rather just their output values on fitness cases. This traceless representation greatly reduces the complexity of fitness evaluation. TGP uses specialized crossover and insertion operators compatible with this representation.

The performance of TGP is evaluated on even-3 to even-8 parity problems and compared to published GP results. Parameters like population size, generations and insertion probability are tuned for each problem. Probability of success and computational effort metrics are used to assess the performance.

Main Contributions
- Proposes Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP), a more scalable GP variant for solving difficult Boolean parity problems. TGP does not store entire programs, just their outputs.
- Defines tailored crossover and insertion operators for TGP.
- Shows that TGP can solve higher-order even-parity problems (up to 8) much faster than standard GP.
- Analysis indicates TGP requires 2-3 orders of magnitude lower effort than GP. 
- TGP is able to evolve a solution for even-7 parity in 92 seconds on a 850 MHz machine.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in designing and demonstrating a novel, more efficient form of Genetic Programming. The traceless representation and custom operators in TGP enable it to scale much better than standard GP.
