# [Solving even-parity problems using traceless genetic programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02014)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Addressed
The paper proposes a new Genetic Programming (GP) variant called Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP) to evolve solutions for difficult Boolean even-parity problems. Even-parity problems are considered very challenging for blind random search methods. The paper argues that standard GP has difficulties scaling to solve higher-order even-parity problems.

Proposed Solution  
TGP is a hybrid technique combining a specialized representation and build mechanism for GP individuals along with custom genetic operators. The key idea in TGP is that it does not explicitly store the full evolved programs, rather just their output values on fitness cases. This traceless representation greatly reduces the complexity of fitness evaluation. TGP uses specialized crossover and insertion operators compatible with this representation.

The performance of TGP is evaluated on even-3 to even-8 parity problems and compared to published GP results. Parameters like population size, generations and insertion probability are tuned for each problem. Probability of success and computational effort metrics are used to assess the performance.

Main Contributions
- Proposes Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP), a more scalable GP variant for solving difficult Boolean parity problems. TGP does not store entire programs, just their outputs.
- Defines tailored crossover and insertion operators for TGP.
- Shows that TGP can solve higher-order even-parity problems (up to 8) much faster than standard GP.
- Analysis indicates TGP requires 2-3 orders of magnitude lower effort than GP. 
- TGP is able to evolve a solution for even-7 parity in 92 seconds on a 850 MHz machine.

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in designing and demonstrating a novel, more efficient form of Genetic Programming. The traceless representation and custom operators in TGP enable it to scale much better than standard GP.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new Genetic Programming variant called Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP) that evolves computer programs without explicitly storing them, applies it to solve even-parity problems more efficiently than standard Genetic Programming, and shows through experiments that TGP can solve parity problems up to order 8.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a new Genetic Programming (GP) variant called Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP). The key features of TGP are:

1) It does not explicitly store the evolved computer programs. Instead, TGP individuals only store the output values for each fitness case, saving space compared to storing entire program trees.

2) It uses two specialized genetic operators - crossover and insertion. Crossover operates directly on the output values rather than on program trees.

3) It has lower time complexity for fitness evaluation than standard GP since TGP individuals simply need to be traversed rather than decoded into full programs. 

4) It is shown to efficiently solve even-parity problems, outperforming standard GP. TGP can solve up to 8-bit even parity problems very quickly, while standard GP struggled with more than 5-bit instances.

So in summary, the main contribution is the proposal and demonstration of the TGP technique for evolving solutions without storing complete programs, enabling more efficient evolution especially on problems like even-parity.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the content of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords that appear most relevant are:

- Traceless Genetic Programming (TGP) - The new GP variant proposed in the paper for evolving computer programs without explicitly storing the programs.

- Even-parity problems - The problems used for evaluating TGP, which involve evolving digital circuits to perform even-parity Boolean functions.

- Crossover and insertion - The two genetic operators used with TGP. Crossover recombines parent programs, while insertion adds simple new programs.

- Individual representation - How TGP represents programs just by their output values on fitness cases rather than explicitly as parse trees.

- Computational effort - A metric used to evaluate TGP's performance relative to standard GP in terms of number of individuals that must be processed.

- Boolean functions - The even-parity problems have inputs and outputs represented as Boolean values. Evolving the mapping between inputs and outputs is the challenge.

So in summary, the key ideas have to do with the TGP technique itself, the even-parity problems it was tested on, the genetic operators it uses, its unusual representation, and the metrics and terminology around evaluating its performance.
