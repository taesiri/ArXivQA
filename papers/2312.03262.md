# [Low-Cost High-Power Membership Inference by Boosting Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Membership inference attacks aim to determine if a specific data point was used to train a machine learning model. These attacks are important tools for evaluating privacy risks from training models on sensitive data. Recent methods exhibit mutual dominance depending on factors like number of reference models, lacking robustness. Also, some attacks require large computation budgets, limiting practical privacy auditing. There is a need for consistent, robust attacks under constraints.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a robust membership inference attack (RMIA) that uses a novel likelihood ratio test leveraging both reference models and reference data. This amplifies distinction between population data and training data to effectively differentiate members from non-members. The test measures if a data point $x$ has higher probability relative to a random non-member point $z$ on the target model compared to reference models. RMIA aggregates evidence across comparisons to many $z$ samples.

Main Contributions:

- RMIA outperforms prior attacks by 2-4x higher TPR at low FPRs, with only 1-2 reference models. It exhibits over 25% higher AUC than LiRA with 1 model.

- The offline version surpasses offline LiRA by 28% AUC and 3x TPR at 0% FPR. It nears online attack performance, enabling practical auditing.

- Analysis shows RMIA robustly dominates across model architectures, datasets, DP-SGD, and algorithms (GBDT). Interpretations reveal limitations of prior attacks.

- The formulation lays groundwork connecting ideas from prior arts, explaining unstable behavior based on approximation choices.

In summary, the paper presents RMIA as an effective, robust, and practical membership inference attack using a principled likelihood ratio test that outperforms state-of-the-art consistently across diverse settings.
