# [Low-Cost High-Power Membership Inference by Boosting Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03262)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new membership inference attack called Relative Membership Inference Attack (RMIA) that outperforms prior state-of-the-art attacks. RMIA is designed to maximize the distinguishability between member and non-member data points. It does this by effectively incorporating both population data samples as well as models trained on such data as reference points to compare against the target model. Specifically, RMIA computes a likelihood ratio between the probability of the model generating the target sample versus generating a random non-member sample. This helps RMIA robustly separate members from non-members. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, RMIA demonstrates superior overall performance across different model architectures, training algorithms, and privacy defenses. Notably, unlike some prior arts, RMIA maintains high attack efficacy even when only a very limited number of reference models are available to the adversary due to computation constraints. For instance, with just a single reference model, RMIA substantially outperforms prior attacks in terms of AUC and true positive rate, especially at very low false positive rates. The paper also provides intuitive analysis to interpret prior attacks within its framework.
