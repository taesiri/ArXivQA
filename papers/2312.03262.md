# [Low-Cost High-Power Membership Inference by Boosting Relativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03262)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new membership inference attack called Relative Membership Inference Attack (RMIA) that outperforms prior state-of-the-art attacks. RMIA is designed to maximize the distinguishability between member and non-member data points. It does this by effectively incorporating both population data samples as well as models trained on such data as reference points to compare against the target model. Specifically, RMIA computes a likelihood ratio between the probability of the model generating the target sample versus generating a random non-member sample. This helps RMIA robustly separate members from non-members. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, RMIA demonstrates superior overall performance across different model architectures, training algorithms, and privacy defenses. Notably, unlike some prior arts, RMIA maintains high attack efficacy even when only a very limited number of reference models are available to the adversary due to computation constraints. For instance, with just a single reference model, RMIA substantially outperforms prior attacks in terms of AUC and true positive rate, especially at very low false positive rates. The paper also provides intuitive analysis to interpret prior attacks within its framework.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a robust membership inference attack that effectively incorporates reference models and data to consistently outperform prior attacks across diverse datasets and model constraints.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new membership inference attack called Relative Membership Inference Attack (RMIA). Specifically:

- RMIA introduces a novel framework for constructing membership inference attacks by effectively incorporating both population data and models trained on them as reference points. This allows RMIA to consistently outperform prior attacks across different datasets and model architectures. 

- RMIA demonstrates superior performance over previous state-of-the-art attacks like LiRA and EnhancedMIA in terms of AUC and true positive rate, especially at very low false positive rates. For example, RMIA achieves over 2-4x higher TPR at 0\% FPR compared to prior attacks when using a small number of reference models.

- The paper provides theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of RMIA's formulation over previous attacks. It also investigates the impact of various factors like the number/similarity of reference models, attack parameters, etc. on performance.

- RMIA introduces a practical and robust framework for auditing privacy risks of machine learning models, with low computation requirements. Unlike some prior attacks, RMIA continues to be effective even with few reference models, making it suitable for cost-constrained real-world deployment.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal and comprehensive analysis of the RMIA attack, which substantially improves upon prior work in membership inference attacks against machine learning models.

The paper presents a new membership inference attack called RMIA that aims to achieve high test power even at very low false positive rates.

Concepts like TPR, FPR, AUC, robustness, and pairwise likelihood ratios are central to evaluating the performance of the proposed attack in comparison to prior art.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new membership inference attack called RMIA. How is the construction of the worlds under the null hypothesis in RMIA different from prior attacks? Why does this lead to a more powerful attack?

2. RMIA computes a likelihood ratio to distinguish members from non-members. Explain the intuition behind using the ratio of $\Pr(x|\theta)/\Pr(x)$ versus $\Pr(z|\theta)/\Pr(z)$ and how this enhances attack effectiveness. 

3. The paper computes likelihood ratios in two ways - using Bayes rule versus a direct expansion. Compare and contrast these two methods. In what scenarios does each perform better?

4. The approximation of $\Pr(x)$ is a key component of RMIA when only OUT models are available. Explain the proposed linear approximation method and discuss its limitations. How could it be improved?

5. RMIA queries the target model on augmentations of the input sample $x$ and uses majority voting. Analyze the impact of using varying numbers of augmented queries on attack performance.

6. The paper empirically shows the instability of prior attacks under differing restrictions on resources. Discuss scenarios where RMIA outperforms prior attacks by a large margin and explain why.

7. How does RMIA deal with the trade-off between the $\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters? What is the intuition behind needing to balance these parameters?

8. Explain why computing likelihood ratios relative to random population samples $z$ makes RMIA more robust compared to prior attacks. How does the choice of number of $z$ samples impact results?

9. Discuss how effective RMIA is at attacking models trained with DP-SGD versus standard SGD. Why does DP-SGD make MIAs challenging? How could RMIA be customized for enhanced DP attack?

10. Beyond empirical analysis, can the superior performance of RMIA be theoretically proven compared to prior likelihood-ratio driven attacks? What statistical assumptions would need to be made?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Membership inference attacks aim to determine if a specific data point was used to train a machine learning model. These attacks are important tools for evaluating privacy risks from training models on sensitive data. Recent methods exhibit mutual dominance depending on factors like number of reference models, lacking robustness. Also, some attacks require large computation budgets, limiting practical privacy auditing. There is a need for consistent, robust attacks under constraints.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a robust membership inference attack (RMIA) that uses a novel likelihood ratio test leveraging both reference models and reference data. This amplifies distinction between population data and training data to effectively differentiate members from non-members. The test measures if a data point $x$ has higher probability relative to a random non-member point $z$ on the target model compared to reference models. RMIA aggregates evidence across comparisons to many $z$ samples.

Main Contributions:

- RMIA outperforms prior attacks by 2-4x higher TPR at low FPRs, with only 1-2 reference models. It exhibits over 25% higher AUC than LiRA with 1 model.

- The offline version surpasses offline LiRA by 28% AUC and 3x TPR at 0% FPR. It nears online attack performance, enabling practical auditing.

- Analysis shows RMIA robustly dominates across model architectures, datasets, DP-SGD, and algorithms (GBDT). Interpretations reveal limitations of prior attacks.

- The formulation lays groundwork connecting ideas from prior arts, explaining unstable behavior based on approximation choices.

In summary, the paper presents RMIA as an effective, robust, and practical membership inference attack using a principled likelihood ratio test that outperforms state-of-the-art consistently across diverse settings.
