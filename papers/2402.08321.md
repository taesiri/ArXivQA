# [Exploration by Optimization with Hybrid Regularizers: Logarithmic Regret   with Adversarial Robustness in Partial Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08321)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Partial monitoring (PM) is a framework for online decision-making problems with limited/bandit feedback. It is challenging to make good decisions from such limited feedback.
- Existing algorithms work well either in stochastic environments or adversarial environments, but it is often unclear which environment the problem belongs to. Algorithms that work well in both environments (best-of-both-worlds or BOBW algorithms) are desirable.  
- Existing BOBW algorithms for PM have suboptimal regret bounds, especially in stochastic environments where bounds are $\Omega(\log^2 T)$ and depend poorly on number of actions $k$.

Key Ideas:
- Use a hybrid regularizer in follow-the-regularized leader (FTRL) consisting of log-barrier and complement Shannon entropy terms. This is known to achieve improved regret in bandits but needs new analysis for PM.
- Introduce a novel exploration-by-optimization (ExO) framework and analysis that upper bounds the ExO objective value with this regularizer. The analysis exploits properties of the water transfer operator.
- The feasible region in ExO is chosen independent of $k$ by a careful truncation that preserves dependence on FTRL output. This is key to improving dependence on $k$.

Main Results:
- For locally observable PM, the algorithm achieves $O(\sum_{a \neq a^*} \frac{k^2m^2\log T}{\Delta_a})$ regret in stochastic environments and $O(k^{3/2}m\sqrt{T\log T})$ regret in adversarial environments.
- For globally observable PM, the algorithm achieves $O(\frac{c_{\cal G}^2k\log T}{\Delta^2})$ regret in stochastic environments and $O((c_{\cal G}T)^{2/3}(\log T)^{1/3})$ regret in adversarial environments.
- These are the first PM algorithms with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ stochastic regret and significantly improve dependence on $T,k$.

In summary, the paper makes important progress in designing BOBW algorithms for PM by using hybrid regularizers and novel ExO analyses. The regret bounds in stochastic environments are greatly improved.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes new algorithms with best-of-both-worlds guarantees for partial monitoring that achieve $O(\log T)$ regret bounds in stochastic environments and improved bounds in adversarial environments, for both locally and globally observable games, by using hybrid regularizers and novel analyses tailored to partial monitoring.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes the first best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms for partial monitoring that achieve O(log T) regret bounds in stochastic environments for both locally and globally observable games. This is accomplished through the use of hybrid regularizers consisting of the log-barrier and complement negative Shannon entropy.

2) For locally observable games, it significantly improves upon existing BOBW regret bounds, achieving roughly O(k^2 log T) better dependence on the number of actions k. Specifically, it proves a stochastic regret bound of O(sum_(a≠a*) (k^2 m^2 log T)/Δ_a) where Δ_a is the suboptimality gap of action a.  

3) For globally observable games, it provides the first BOBW algorithm with an O(log T) stochastic regret bound, at the expense of worse dependence on k.

4) It develops a new analysis to bound the optimal value of the exploration by optimization (ExO) objective when using the hybrid regularizer over a truncated probability simplex. This allows optimization over a feasible region independent of k, leading to regret bound improvements.

In summary, it significantly advances the state-of-the-art in BOBW partial monitoring algorithms using new analysis for hybrid regularizers combined with ExO. The key novelty is getting optimal O(log T) stochastic bounds while maintaining adversarial robustness.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Partial monitoring - A framework for sequential decision making problems with limited feedback. The learner aims to minimize cumulative loss based only on limited feedback signals.

- Exploration by optimization (ExO) - A technique to determine action selection probabilities by optimizing an objective that balances exploration and estimation accuracy. A key component of algorithms for partial monitoring. 

- Follow-the-regularized leader (FTRL) - An online learning algorithm where actions are chosen by minimizing a tradeoff between expected cumulative loss and a regularization function. Commonly combined with ExO.

- Hybrid regularizer - A regularization function combining both log-barrier and negative entropy terms. Allows deriving good regret bounds in both stochastic and adversarial settings.

- Best-of-both-worlds algorithms - Algorithms that achieve optimal or near-optimal performance guarantees in both stochastic and adversarial environments, without needing to know the environment.

- Locally/globally observable games - Classes of partial monitoring games categorized by observational properties. Locally observable games have easier structure that allows better regret.

- Regret bounds - Performance guarantees on the difference between the online learner's loss and best fixed action in hindsight. Key metric for measuring performance.

- Self-bounding technique - A method for getting best-of-both-worlds guarantees by combining upper and lower bounds on regret.

The paper develops best-of-both-worlds algorithms for partial monitoring using a novel ExO analysis with hybrid regularizers. The key focus is obtaining tight regret bounds in both stochastic and adversarial settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using a hybrid regularizer consisting of the log-barrier and complement negative Shannon entropy. Why is this combination of regularizers beneficial compared to using just one? How do the properties of each complement each other?

2. The paper shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a stochastic regret bound that scales as $\Delta_a$-wise rather than depending on the minimum suboptimality gap $\Delta_{\min}$. Explain why getting regret bounds in terms of $\Delta_a$ is more desirable and how the method achieves this. 

3. The analysis introduces a novel upper bound on the optimal value of the ExO objective when using the hybrid regularizer. Walk through the key ideas in the proof of Lemma 3.1 and highlight what makes this analysis non-trivial compared to prior work.  

4. How does restricting the probability simplex in the ExO formulation to $\calR(q)$ rather than $\calP'_k(q)$ lead to an improved dependence on the number of actions $k$? Explain the intuition.

5. The regret bound for adversarial environments is $O(\sqrt{\log k})$ times smaller than prior work. Identify which components of the analysis contribute to this improved bound.

6. Discuss the challenges in directly applying the blackbox reduction approach by Dann et al. (2023) for obtaining a BOBW guarantee in partial monitoring games. What complications arise?

7. Compare and contrast the techniques used to prove Theorem 1 versus Theorem 2. What sacrifices were made in Theorem 2 to obtain a $O(\log T)$ regret for globally observable games?

8. How does the introduction of the water transfer operator $W_\nu$ facilitate the proof of the stability bound with the hybrid regularizer? What are its key properties?  

9. The complement negative Shannon entropy in the regularizer provably improves robustness to stochastic corruptions. Intuitively explain why this is the case.

10. The stochastic regret scales in terms of action-dependent gaps $\Delta_a$ rather than the minimum $\Delta_{\min}$. What steps in the analysis lead to this improved dependence? How could this dependance be further sharpened?
