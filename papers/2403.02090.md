# [Modeling Multimodal Social Interactions: New Challenges and Baselines   with Densely Aligned Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Understanding social interactions involving both verbal and non-verbal cues is essential to effectively interpret social situations. 
- However, most prior works focus on single-person behaviors or rely on holistic visual representations in multi-party environments that are not densely aligned to utterances. 
- They are limited in modeling the intricate dynamics of multi-party interactions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces three new challenging tasks to model fine-grained dynamics between multiple people in social deduction games: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction.
- It contributes extensive new data annotations to curate these tasks using videos of social deduction games. 
- A novel multimodal baseline is proposed that establishes dense alignments between language and visual representations. 
- Player visual features are tracked and synchronized with utterances over time. This captures both verbal and non-verbal cues pertinent to social reasoning concurrently.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of three new challenging multimodal tasks: speaking target identification, pronoun coreference resolution, and mentioned player prediction.
- Extensive new data annotations for the tasks using videos of social deduction games.
- A novel multimodal baseline that leverages densely aligned language and visual representations to capture fine-grained social dynamics between multiple interacting people.
- Experiments demonstrating consistent performance improvements over approaches without dense multimodal alignment.
- Public release of the new benchmarks and source code to facilitate further research.
