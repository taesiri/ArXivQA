## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces Achelous++, a versatile water-surface perception framework for autonomous vessels that focuses on multi-task learning through vision-radar fusion while emphasizing low power consumption for edge devices. Achelous++ supports five concurrent perception tasks: object detection, semantic segmentation, drivable area segmentation, waterline segmentation, and radar point cloud segmentation. It incorporates a range of state-of-the-art deep learning components and facilitates easy integration and evaluation of custom models. A key contribution is a novel radar convolution operator to effectively extract features from sparse, irregular radar point clouds projected onto a 2D image plane. The paper also proposes a heterogeneous modalities aware pruning technique to slim down models for faster, lower-power inference. Experiments demonstrate Achelous++'s state-of-the-art accuracy across tasks compared to other fusion and non-fusion based models, while striking an effective balance between speed and power efficiency. The code is publicly available to facilitate further research into multi-modal perception for autonomous marine vehicles. By emphasizing low computational costs, Achelous++ exemplifies an environmentally-conscious approach to perception system design.

- Introduces radar convolution to effectively model radar point cloud features.
- Proposes HA-SynFlow pruning method to prune different modalities based on saliency.

Main Contributions:
- Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on WaterScenes dataset while optimizing speed (up to 28 FPS on AGX Orin) and power (741J per sample on Orin).
- Outperforms parallel single-task models in speed and power consumption.  
- Provides highly flexible framework to develop customized models and evaluation functions.
- Effectively handles small, occluded targets by fusing vision and radar.
- The code is open-sourced to facilitate low-power perception research.

In summary, the paper presents a highly optimized and accurate multi-modal multi-task perception framework for water-surfaces that pushes state-of-the-art while being cognizant of efficiency and environmental impact. The flexibility of the framework and model pruning technique facilitate customized low-power model development.
