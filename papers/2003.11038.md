# [Deformable Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11038)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to incorporate geometry into neural style transfer in a flexible, domain-agnostic way. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a method called deformable style transfer (DST) to transfer both the texture/color aspects of style, as well as geometric aspects like shape and form. Most prior neural style transfer work focuses only on texture/color. The key idea is to spatially warp the content image to align its geometry with that of the style image, guided by correspondences between the two. 

The paper presents DST as a general framework that can build on existing optimization-based style transfer methods by adding this spatial deformation component. A main goal is developing something domain-agnostic that works with any content/style image pair, not requiring special datasets or training like some prior face/portrait-specific techniques.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that incorporating spatial alignment/warping between content and style images can enable style transfer methods to better capture geometric style, rather than just texture/color. The paper proposes and evaluates an approach to achieve this in a flexible way not restricted to a single domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called deformable style transfer (DST) that incorporates geometric deformation into neural style transfer to better capture the style of artistic images. 

Specifically, the key contributions are:

- An optimization-based framework that allows deforming the content image to match the geometry/shape of the style image, in addition to traditional color/texture transfer. This enables capturing geometric aspects of style.

- A method to guide the deformation using sparse correspondences between content and style images found using off-the-shelf algorithms like NBB. The deformation is modeled using differentiable image warping. 

- A joint objective function combining content, style, and deformation losses to transfer both textural and geometric style in a harmonious way.

- Demonstrating the framework on a diverse set of images including portraits, animals, objects etc. The results show DST can dramatically improve perceived stylization without sacrificing content preservation.

- Compared to prior work on geometric style transfer, DST is the first general domain-agnostic approach not restricted to a specific domain like faces or requiring training on paired datasets.

In summary, the key innovation is a flexible optimization framework to incorporate spatial deformation into neural style transfer, enabling open-domain geometric style transfer in a one-shot scenario.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes deformable style transfer (DST), a novel approach that incorporates geometric deformation into style transfer to better match the shape and form of a style image by optimizing stylization parameters and deformation parameters jointly.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper on deformable style transfer presents some key advances compared to prior work on incorporating geometry into neural style transfer:

- It proposes the first domain-agnostic, one-shot method for geometric style transfer. Previous methods like Face of Art and WarpGAN require training on domain-specific datasets of portrait/caricature pairs. This method uses sparse correspondences between the content and style images to guide deformation, without requiring a dataset.

- The deformation is incorporated into the style transfer optimization in a flexible way, alongside traditional texture/color losses. This allows jointly optimizing for stylization and desired spatial deformation rather than a rigid two-stage process.

- The method is demonstrated to work across diverse domains like faces, animals, objects, and scenes. Prior work focused almost exclusively on human faces/portraits. This supports the claim that the approach is more general.

- A user study indicates the proposed deformation framework significantly improves perceived stylization while preserving content on par with standard methods. This helps quantify the benefits.

Some limitations compared to state-of-the-art in specific domains:

- The generic correspondence finding may not be as robust as learned detectors for faces. Results on faces are not yet on par with specialized methods.

- Optimization-based style transfer is slower than feed-forward neural networks. This method may be too slow for real-time uses.

- Relying on sparse keypoints can cause artifacts if matches are incorrect. A dense correspondence field could be more robust.

Overall, I would say this paper carves out a novel portion of the style transfer research landscape by tackling geometry in a general way. The results showcase the potential of this direction while pointing to areas for improvement in future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more robust keypoint matching algorithms for highly stylized images. They note that poor keypoint matches often lead to unsuccessful deformations in their method. Better matching could improve results.

- Exploring more flexible ways to represent geometric style beyond warp fields driven by paired keypoints. They mention it is uncertain if their approach is the most effective for geometric style transfer. Other representations could be developed.

- More accurately encoding the artistic abstraction of shape and form. The authors hope future work continues to explore how to represent geometric style in ways that capture an artist's unique extraction and abstraction of shapes.

- Narrowing down the problem for highly stylized images. This could involve developing correspondence algorithms specifically for matching points between a realistic image and a highly stylized artistic image.

- Generalizing the method to allow deformation guided by more than two images. The paper focuses on transferring between a content and style image, but allowing guidance from multiple style images could be interesting.

In summary, the main future directions mentioned are improving correspondence algorithms for this task, exploring more flexible geometric style representations, better capturing artistic abstraction of shape, and extending the method to leverage more guidance images. The authors see room for improvement in how geometric style is represented and transferred.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents deformable style transfer (DST), a novel approach for incorporating geometry into neural style transfer. DST jointly optimizes texture/color stylization with a spatial deformation that warps the content image to better match the geometry of the style image. This deformation is guided by correspondences between keypoints in the two images. DST combines traditional style and content losses with a deformation loss that encourages aligning the keypoints, and a smoothness regularizer. It works with existing optimization-based style transfer methods like Gatys et al. and STROTSS. DST is the first domain-agnostic approach for geometric style transfer, in contrast to prior face-specific methods. Experiments show DST can dramatically improve perceived stylization without sacrificing content preservation. The work enables style transfer that better captures the artistic abstraction of shape and form.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents deformable style transfer (DST), a novel approach for incorporating geometry into neural style transfer. Existing style transfer methods focus on color and texture transfer but largely ignore geometry, a key aspect of visual style. DST addresses this by jointly optimizing a stylized image along with a spatial deformation that warps the content to better match the geometry of the style image. The deformation is guided by correspondences between keypoints in the content and style. The method can build on any differentiable optimization-based style transfer technique. The overall objective function balances stylization, content preservation, and deformation through hyperparameter weighting. 

DST is demonstrated to effectively capture geometric style aspects in a variety of domains including portraits, animals, objects, and scenes. It does not require training with paired data like some prior face-specific methods. Experiments show DST results are preferred by humans over baseline style transfer lacking deformation, with minimal perceived reduction in content preservation. Limitations are sensitivity to correspondence quality and complexity of spatial deformation. Overall, DST represents an important step toward incorporating notions of shape and geometry into neural style transfer.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes deformable style transfer (DST), an optimization-based approach for transferring both texture and geometry style from one image to another. DST takes a content image and a style image as input. It finds a set of corresponding keypoints between the two images using a method called Neural Best-Buddies. These keypoints specify how to deform the content image to better match the geometry of the style image. DST then jointly optimizes the pixel values of the output image to match the texture style of the style image, while also optimizing deformation parameters to warp the output image so that the keypoints align to the style image. The joint optimization balances preserving content, minimizing texture style differences, and achieving the desired spatial deformation. Through this joint optimization, DST transfers both the texture and geometry style from the style image to the content image.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the limitation of existing style transfer methods which focus primarily on capturing texture and color aspects of style while largely ignoring the geometry and shapes which are also fundamental aspects of visual style. The key question the paper tries to tackle is how to incorporate geometry into neural style transfer in a flexible, one-shot, domain-agnostic manner. 

Some key points:

- Style transfer has focused on texture/color, ignoring shape/geometry which are also integral to artistic style. The paper wants to address this limitation.

- Existing methods that do geometric style transfer rely on training with datasets of images in a particular style or domain (often faces/caricatures). The paper aims for a more general approach.

- The paper proposes deformable style transfer (DST), which incorporates geometry by spatially deforming the content image to match the shape/form of the style image guided by correspondences.

- DST is optimization-based like other one-shot style transfer methods, avoiding the need for training data. It incorporates the deformation loss into the overall objective.

- DST works with any existing style transfer method and improves stylization without sacrificing content preservation, as shown through human evaluation.

In summary, the key focus is developing a way to make style transfer match the geometric style/shape of the style image in addition to texture, without being restricted to a particular domain or requiring training data. DST is proposed as a flexible, optimization-based approach to achieve this in a general setting.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes deformable style transfer (DST), a method to incorporate geometric style into neural style transfer. Existing style transfer methods focus on color and texture style but ignore geometric style. DST adds a spatial warping module to standard style transfer methods to deform the content image and match the geometry of the style image. It optimizes an objective function with three terms - content loss, style loss, and deformation loss based on matching keypoints between the content and style images. The deformation is regularized to avoid artifacts. DST allows one-shot style transfer without training on matched content/style pairs. Experiments show it captures geometric style while preserving content on diverse images. Compared to learning-based face caricature methods, DST produces competitive results despite being more general. A human study indicates DST outputs have much higher perceived style without sacrificing content relative to standard style transfer.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach called Deformable Style Transfer (DST) to incorporate geometry into style transfer algorithms. Existing style transfer methods focus on texture and color but ignore geometry, which is a fundamental aspect of visual style according to art historians. DST takes a content image and a style image as input. It finds correspondences between the two images using a algorithm that matches keypoints based on CNN features. These sparse correspondences are used to define a spatial warp that deforms the content image to better match the style image geometry. The warp is parameterized and incorporated into the optimization-based style transfer objective function, along with the standard content and style losses. The new joint objective is optimized to simultaneously match the texture style, preserve content, and obtain the desired geometric deformation. This allows creating stylized images that capture both the texture and geometric style of the reference style image. DST works in a one-shot setting, without requiring training data of image pairs in a specific domain. Experiments demonstrate it can improve style transfer results for diverse image types like portraits, animals, objects and scenes. A user study confirms the improved stylization without significantly impacting content preservation.
