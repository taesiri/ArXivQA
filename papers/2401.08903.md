# [PPR: Enhancing Dodging Attacks while Maintaining Impersonation Attacks   on Face Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08903)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Face recognition (FR) systems are vulnerable to two types of adversarial attacks: impersonation attacks (fooling the system to recognize an attacker image as a victim) and dodging attacks (preventing the system from recognizing the attacker image as the attacker). 
- Prior attack methods focused on either impersonation or dodging attacks, but not both. However, real-world attackers would want to both impersonate a victim and dodge identification.  
- The paper shows that achieving high success on impersonation attacks does not guarantee success on dodging attacks. This is due to "multi-identity samples" - images that can be recognized as multiple identities by the FR system.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new attack method called Pre-training Pruning Restoration (PPR) that enhances dodging attack success while maintaining impersonation attack success.

- PPR has three main steps:
   1) Pre-train: Generate impersonation adversarial images using existing attacks.
   2) Prune: Identify and remove the less important perturbations to sparsify the adversarial image.
   3) Restore: Add new perturbations in the pruned regions that specifically enhance dodging attack success.

- By pruning pre-trained perturbations and selectively adding new ones, PPR improves dodging without compromising impersonation performance.

Main Contributions:
- Verify existence of multi-identity samples among adversarial images crafted with impersonation attacks. Show these can succeed on impersonation but fail on dodging attacks.
- Propose PPR attack method to improve dodging attack success through adversarial image pruning and restoration while maintaining impersonation success.
- Extensive experiments showing PPR achieves much higher dodging success rates than baseline attacks, without decreasing impersonation success rates.

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of prior impersonation attacks on FR systems regarding dodging attacks, and presents a novel PPR framework to address this limitation and enable stronger real-world attacks. The core ideas are pruning adversarial perturbations and selectively restoring them to improve dodging attack success.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method called Pre-training Pruning Restoration Attack (PPR) that enhances dodging attacks on face recognition while maintaining effectiveness of impersonation attacks by pruning and restoring perturbations on pre-trained adversarial examples.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It verifies the existence of multi-identity samples among adversarial face examples crafted by traditional impersonation attacks and shows that a successful impersonation attack does not necessarily guarantee a successful dodging attack on face recognition systems. 

2. It proposes a novel attack method called Pre-training Pruning Restoration Attack (PPR) that enhances the dodging performance of adversarial face examples while maintaining their impersonation performance. The key ideas are pruning the pre-trained adversarial examples to free up some perturbations and then restoring perturbations in those areas that favor dodging attacks.

3. It conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PPR attack method in improving dodging performance without compromising impersonation performance compared to various baseline attacks.

In summary, the paper makes an important observation about the limitation of traditional impersonation attacks for evasion, and proposes a new attack method called PPR to address this limitation and boost dodging performance while keeping impersonation effectiveness intact. The effectiveness of PPR is validated through experiments.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Face recognition (FR) systems
- Adversarial attacks
- Impersonation attacks
- Dodging attacks
- Multi-identity samples
- Attack success rate (ASR)
- Pre-training Pruning Restoration Attack (PPR)
- Adversarial example pruning
- Sparsity ratio
- Embedding space
- Decision boundaries

The paper focuses on adversarial attacks against face recognition systems, specifically impersonation attacks where an adversarial example is misclassified as a target victim, and dodging attacks where the example evades identification as the attacker. A key observation is that impersonation success does not guarantee dodging success due to "multi-identity samples." The proposed PPR attack enhances dodging attack performance by pruning and restoring perturbations in the adversarial examples. Key metrics assessed are impersonation and dodging attack success rates. The analysis examines decision boundaries in the face embedding space to explain differences in attack performance.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel attack method called Pre-training Pruning Restoration Attack (PPR). Can you explain in detail the key ideas behind this attack method and what motivated its development? 

2. The paper talks about the existence of "multi-identity samples" in face recognition. What are multi-identity samples and what causes them to exist? Why is their existence relevant for developing the PPR attack?

3. The PPR attack involves three main stages - pre-training, pruning, and restoration. Can you walk through what happens in each stage and why each stage is important? What is the purpose of the pruning stage in particular?

4. How exactly does the PPR attack allow improving dodging attack performance while maintaining impersonation attack performance? What is the reasoning behind why this method can achieve both objectives? 

5. What are the key hyperparameters involved in the PPR attack algorithm, such as sparsity ratio? How sensitive is the attack performance to choices of these hyperparameters? 

6. The paper compares PPR to several baseline attack methods. What were those baseline methods and what specifically does PPR improve over them? Why can't those baseline methods achieve the same performance?

7. The paper talks about the inherent tradeoff between impersonation and dodging attack performance. Using ideas from the paper, can you explain the causes of this tradeoff and why it exists?  

8. Can you analyze why traditional impersonation attacks often fail at dodging attacks in black-box settings based on the decision boundaries illustrated in Figure 5?

9. What differences would you expect in how the PPR attack performs on white-box vs. black-box models? What adjustments might be needed for white-box attack?

10. The paper focuses on face recognition, but do you think the core ideas of PPR could be generalized to other domains? What kinds of adaptations would be needed?
