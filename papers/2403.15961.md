# [SAT Encoding of Partial Ordering Models for Graph Coloring Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15961)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies two graph coloring problems - the Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) which aims to color the vertices of a graph with the minimum number of colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, and the Bandwidth Coloring Problem (BCP), which is a generalization of GCP where each edge has a weight and the coloring must satisfy a minimum "distance" between colors based on edge weights. 

- Exact approaches based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) have shown promising results for these problems. The paper reviews common ILP formulations like the assignment-based model and partial ordering-based models as well as SAT encodings of them.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes new SAT encodings for the partial ordering-based ILP models to solve GCP and BCP. For GCP, it also integrates symmetry breaking constraints to eliminate symmetric equivalent solutions.

- For BCP, a modification of the partial ordering SAT/ILP model is proposed that needs only 1 constraint per edge/color compared to the classical assignment model resulting in an asymptotically smaller formulation size.

Main Contributions:
- Experimentally evaluated SAT encodings on the DIMACS benchmark set for GCP. Results show the new SAT encoding solves more instances than state-of-the-art including assignment-based SAT, set cover ILPs and other methods. It is particularly effective for sparse graphs.

- For BCP, the new SAT encoding clearly dominates published exact methods solving more benchmark instances to optimality. Several previously open instances from literature solved for the first time. Show strong correlation between smaller formulation size and solver performance.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions around new SAT encodings for graph coloring based on partial ordering models. Both theoretically and empirically it demonstrates advantages of the proposed techniques to advance state-of-the-art.
