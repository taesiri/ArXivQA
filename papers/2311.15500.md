# [Function-constrained Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15500)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel method for constrained program synthesis using large language models (LLMs). The key idea is to constrain the LLM to only use a set of user-provided functions when generating code, allowing it to leverage custom code. A prompting approach is developed that maximizes the LLM's use of the given functions. When constrained code generation fails, the method automatically generates modular sub-functions to aid subsequent attempts, iteratively building a library of reusable components. Through experiments on datasets like HumanEval and APPS, the authors demonstrate that constraining models like GPT-3.5/4 significantly hurts performance, but providing relevant sub-functions helps recover much of the lost accuracy. For example, when constrained to a set of 21 custom functions, GPT-3.5 sees a 11.5% drop on HumanEval, but providing a single automatically-generated sub-function recovers performance to 73.1%. A key benefit is the method generates reusable and modular sub-functions as a byproduct. The authors also introduce a “half-shot” evaluation approach that adds formatting instructions to prompts, getting better estimates of coding abilities. Overall, the method enables leveraging user-provided code in LLM program synthesis and handling failures through iterative sub-function generation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a method for iteratively generating modular sub-functions to aid large language models in successfully implementing target algorithms when constrained to user-provided code snippets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) A methodology that constrains large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to generate programs using only user-provided code snippets (functions) given in the prompt context. This allows users to explicitly specify which functions the LLM can and cannot use.

2) An iterative process to generate modular sub-functions when the constrained LLM fails to generate working code. The sub-functions aid subsequent attempts at code generation by providing missing functionality that the model needs. This results in a library of reusable sub-functions as a byproduct.

3) Introduction of a "half-shot" evaluation paradigm that provides stricter formatting instructions to LLMs to minimize avoidable syntax errors that could be misinterpreted as poor coding ability in traditional zero-shot evaluations.

In summary, the key innovation is constraining LLMs to user-provided code snippets and automatically generating helpful sub-functions when the model fails, enabling the iterative development of a reusable function library. The "half-shot" evaluation provides a more accurate estimate of coding abilities.

The paper introduces a technique to allow large language models to leverage user-provided code when solving programming tasks. It also presents a method to iteratively generate modular sub-functions that can aid future code generation attempts when the initial code produced by the LLM is inadequate. Key ideas include constraining LLMs to use specific code, handling failures through sub-function generation, and a "half-shot" evaluation approach. The end goal is reusable and modular sub-functions that can solve related tasks, imitating a software team.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the concept of "half-shot" evaluation to provide tighter estimates of language models' coding abilities. Can you explain more about why typical "zero-shot" evaluation can be problematic and how "half-shot" evaluation addresses this issue? 

2. When constraining the language models to use only the set of provided "replica" functions, what techniques were used in the prompting to maximize the likelihood that the models would use those functions and avoid reverting to native functions they are more familiar with?

3. When the constrained language model fails to generate functional code, the method relies on generating "sub-functions" to provide additional context. What is the rationale behind this approach? Why would adding modular sub-functions help improve the success rate?

4. The process of generating the sub-functions to aid the constrained language model is a key contribution. Can you walk through the specifics of how the sub-function generation prompt is constructed and what elements it contains? 

5. When integrating the automatically generated sub-functions back into the code generation flow, the sub-functions are distinguished as a separate set $V^*$. Why is this distinction important rather than just adding them into the full function set $V$?

6. The results show that providing sub-functions generated by GPT-4 result in better performance than even hand-written sub-functions provided by a human expert. What might explain why the GPT-generated sub-functions are more effective?

7. One experiment varies the number of sub-functions provided to analyze the optimal amount. Why doesn't providing all sub-functions match the expected average one-at-a-time accuracy? What does this reveal?

8. Beyond the quantitative accuracy results measured, what differences were observed qualitatively between the code generated by constrained vs unconstrained models? Provide some examples.

9. The replica functions aim to replicate common Python standard library functions under different names. What were the criteria used when developing these replicas? Why use different names?

10. The method relies on an iterative process to progressively build up a library of reusable sub-functions. In what ways does this approach mimic how software development efficiency tends to scale with experience in teams?
