# [Cross-Attention Fusion of Visual and Geometric Features for Large   Vocabulary Arabic Lipreading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11520)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Lipreading involves recognizing spoken words by analyzing lip movements in videos. It has many applications but faces challenges due to similarities in lip movements across words, appearance variations, and lack of large Arabic lipreading datasets. Prior works in other languages fuse visual and geometric lip features but use basic concatenation lacking ability to capture essential mutual information.

Proposed Solution: This paper introduces an efficient cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate visual and facial landmark features for large vocabulary Arabic lipreading. It also presents the first large-scale Lip Reading in the Wild for Arabic (LRW-AR) dataset. 

The proposed architecture consists of:
1) Video preprocessing to crop mouth regions and obtain facial landmarks
2) Visual-feature network with 3D and 2D ConvNets to extract visual features
3) Geometric-feature network with graph attention networks to encode landmark features 
4) FusionNet with multi-head cross-attention to align and fuse the visual and landmark features
5) Sequence decoder network using a Temporal ConvNet to classify input video

Main Contributions:
- First large Arabic lipreading dataset LRW-AR with 20K videos of 100 words uttered by 36 speakers
- Novel cross-attention fusion approach to effectively combine visual and geometric lip features to improve accuracy
- Comprehensive experiments highlighting superiority of the fusion approach, achieving 85.85% accuracy on LRW-AR
- First deep learning lipreading system for large Arabic vocabulary at the word level, providing insights into feasibility and effectiveness of lipreading for Arabic language

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in advancing Arabic visual speech recognition through an efficient cross-modal fusion strategy and a large-scale lipreading dataset. The high performance of 85.85% accuracy demonstrates this approach's effectiveness for the Arabic language.
