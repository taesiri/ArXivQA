# [A StrongREJECT for Empty Jailbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10260)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying significant weaknesses in existing jailbreak evaluation methods, which often overestimate the effectiveness of jailbreaks. 

2. Showing that some jailbreaks actually make models less capable, even on benign tasks, by substantially decreasing performance on the MMLU benchmark.

3. Proposing a new benchmark, StrongREJECT, that provides more balanced and accurate assessments of jailbreak techniques. StrongREJECT has an improved question set and automatic grading algorithm that better reflects expert human judgment.

4. Using the improved StrongREJECT benchmark to evaluate a range of published jailbreaks, finding that most are less effective than prior grading schemes suggested. The new benchmark also reveals cases where jailbreaks reduce model quality even for an "uncensored" model like Dolphin.

5. Underscoring the importance of unbiased, accurate jailbreak evaluations and providing the research community with a robust new benchmark to achieve this.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 This paper focuses on evaluating jailbreak techniques for large language models (LLMs). Based on my review, the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Jailbreaks
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Benchmarking
- Evaluation methods
- Response quality
- Autograders
- Robustness
- Misuse potential
- Harmful content

The core goal is to develop an improved benchmark called "StrongREJECT" to evaluate jailbreaks more accurately compared to prior methods. The key ideas involve creating better datasets of forbidden prompts and using a new autograder that better matches human assessments. The paper analyzes weaknesses in existing approaches and demonstrates how StrongREJECT provides a more balanced perspective.

Some other notable terms highlighted are competing objectives, mismatched generalization, roleplay attacks, injection attacks, obfuscation, performance impacts of jailbreaks, and responsible disclosure. But the main focus is on jailbreak evaluation through the proposed StrongREJECT benchmark.
