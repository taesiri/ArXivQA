# [Efficient Pruning of Large Language Model with Adaptive Estimation   Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10799)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have become crucial for many generative downstream tasks, but their massive scale poses challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices. 
- Structured pruning is a common method to address this, but general approaches often use coarse-grained importance estimation methods for pruning the complex multi-layer decoder structures in LLMs. This leads to reduced accuracy on specific downstream tasks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an adaptive fusion method that seamlessly integrates both coarse-grained and fine-grained importance estimations for structured pruning of LLM decoder layers. 
- It models the importance of each decoder sub-structure in an end-to-end pruning framework. 
- The coarse-grained estimation captures global relevance of structures while fine-grained estimation provides local gradient update details. The fusion is adaptive based on task-specific demands.

Key Contributions:
- Identifies limitation of using generic importance estimation across all LLM decoder layers containing diverse operators like MLP, Attention etc.
- Introduces adaptive modeling to fuse coarse-grained and fine-grained importance assessment of coupled structures in LLMs.
- Achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy improvements of 1.1-2% on mainstream LLM benchmark datasets like LLaMa-7B, Vicuna-7B, Baichuan-7B and Bloom-7b1.
- Enhances robustness of importance estimation for coupled structures through the end-to-end pruning process.

In summary, the paper presents an adaptive fusion technique for structured pruning that combines coarse-grained and fine-grained estimations to effectively compress LLMs while preserving or improving accuracy across diverse downstream tasks. The adaptive nature optimizes the pruning by aligning it with model intricacies and task characteristics.
