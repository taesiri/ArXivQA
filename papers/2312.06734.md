# [DiffCast: A Unified Framework via Residual Diffusion for Precipitation   Nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06734)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Precipitation nowcasting aims to predict future radar echo sequences given current observations. It is challenging due to the chaotic evolution nature of precipitation systems, which are governed by both global deterministic motion trends and local stochastic variations in particle growth/decay. Existing methods either model the system fully deterministically or fully stochastically, leading to blurry forecasts or positionally inaccurate forecasts.  

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes DiffCast, a flexible framework to model both the global determinism and local stochastics. It decomposes the system into a deterministic motion trend and stochastic residual. A motion predictor captures the global trend while a residual diffusion model handles local variations. 

Key ideas:
(1) Decompose system into deterministic motion and stochastic residual with a residual mechanism. 
(2) Motion predictor acts as a deterministic backbone to capture global motion trends.
(3) Residual diffusion model incorporates stochasticity to enhance details.
(4) Jointly train the motion and diffusion models end-to-end.

Contributions:
(1) First framework to model both deterministic and stochastic aspects of precipitation systems.
(2) Flexible framework that can equip any motion predictor backbones.
(3) Novel residual diffusion design using multi-scale temporal features as conditions.
(4) State-of-the-art results on four real-world radar datasets. The framework significantly boosts existing backbone predictors.

In summary, this paper makes both methodology and performance contributions for precipitation nowcasting by proposing a flexible framework to decompose and model the global determinism and local stochastics with residual diffusion. Experiments verify its effectiveness.
