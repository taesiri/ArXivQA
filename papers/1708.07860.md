# [Multi-task Self-Supervised Visual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07860)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to effectively combine multiple self-supervised learning tasks to train a single visual representation. The key hypotheses are:- Combining diverse self-supervised tasks will lead to better feature representations compared to using any single task alone, because different tasks will induce complementary features. - Explicitly encouraging the network to separate the features needed for different tasks (via the lasso technique) will further improve the learned representation. - Modifying inputs so tasks receive more similar inputs ("harmonization") will reduce conflicts between tasks and also improve the joint representation.In particular, the paper investigates combining four different self-supervised tasks - relative position, colorization, exemplar learning, and motion segmentation. It hypothesizes that jointly training on these diverse tasks will produce a unified visual representation that outperforms each individual task, and approaches the performance of fully supervised pre-training on ImageNet classification. The lasso technique and input harmonization are proposed as methods to further reduce conflicts between different self-supervised tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is developing methods for combining multiple self-supervised visual learning tasks to train a single visual representation. Specifically:- They provide an apples-to-apples comparison of four different self-supervised tasks (relative position, colorization, exemplar, and motion segmentation) using the ResNet-101 architecture. - They show that combining multiple self-supervised tasks via a multi-task learning framework improves performance over individual tasks alone on ImageNet classification, PASCAL object detection, and NYU depth prediction.- They propose methods to mitigate conflicts between tasks, including "input harmonization" to make inputs more similar across tasks, and lasso regularization to encourage the network to factorize features.- Their best combined self-supervised model nearly matches ImageNet pre-training on PASCAL detection and matches it on NYU depth prediction, demonstrating self-supervised learning can approach fully supervised pre-training.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating that combining diverse self-supervised tasks is an effective approach for learning visual representations without manual labels, closing the gap with supervised pre-training. The methods for mediated combination of tasks are an additional contribution.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper investigates methods for combining multiple self-supervised visual learning tasks to train a single deep neural network representation, finding that deeper networks work better, combining diverse tasks improves performance, and the gap to supervised pre-training is nearly closed on detection and fully closed on depth prediction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper reports on results from experiments training deep neural networks with multiple self-supervised learning tasks, and evaluating the learned representations on standard computer vision benchmarks. Here is a summary of how it relates to other work in self-supervised learning:- It provides an in-depth study and apples-to-apples comparison of several major self-supervised learning methods on the same deep neural network architecture (ResNet-101). Prior works often used different base architectures, making comparisons difficult. - It shows that combining multiple self-supervised tasks during pre-training leads to better transfer performance compared to individual tasks. This confirms the intuition that diverse pre-training signals are beneficial.- The performance of the multi-task self-supervised model comes very close to supervised pre-training on ImageNet classification for PASCAL object detection, and matches it for NYU depth prediction. This narrows the gap between self-supervised and supervised pre-training.- It proposes methods like input harmonization and lasso regularization to try to learn more unified representations from diverse self-supervised tasks. However, these give minimal improvements over naively combining tasks.- Compared to concurrent work in 2017, this paper achieves stronger performance by using a deeper ResNet architecture and training for longer. But the concepts are similar to earlier papers on combining self-supervised losses.- Later work has built on these ideas to achieve even better performance by using more data, architectural improvements like selective kernels, and new pretext tasks like rotation prediction. But this paper provided an important proof of concept.In summary, this paper significantly advanced self-supervised learning by conducting a rigorous large-scale study, showing the benefits of multi-task learning, and almost matching supervised pre-training. It laid the foundation for subsequent progress in self-supervised representation learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest the following future research directions in the paper:- Adding more self-supervision tasks: The authors note that new self-supervision tasks have been proposed during the preparation of the paper, such as in Fernando et al. (2016). Adding more diverse tasks could potentially lead to learning more general and useful features.- Adding more evaluation tasks: The authors suggest replacing the depth prediction task with an alternative shape measurement task like surface normal prediction, which may be more informative. Evaluating on more diverse tasks could better probe the generality of the learned features.- Experiments with different network architectures: The authors suggest trying VGG-16, which has less correlation between layers, or even deeper networks like ResNet-152 and DenseNet to analyze the relationship between network depth and self-supervision performance.- Experiments with larger datasets: It is an open question whether using larger self-supervision datasets could improve performance. - Dynamic task weighting: The authors propose exploring methods to dynamically weight the importance of different self-supervision tasks during optimization to improve learning.- Block-level lasso regularization: For the lasso experiments, the authors suggest investigating block-level weightings using group sparsity regularization.- No supervised pre-training: The results show self-supervision may eventually replace or augment supervised pre-training, which is a direction for future work.In summary, the main future directions are: exploring more tasks, architectures, and datasets; dynamically weighting tasks; improved regularization techniques; and reducing reliance on supervised pre-training. The authors aim to further close the gap between self-supervised and fully supervised methods.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:The paper investigates methods for combining multiple self-supervised learning tasks to train a single visual representation. The authors implement and compare four different self-supervised tasks (relative position, colorization, exemplar, and motion segmentation) using ResNet-101 architecture. They evaluate the learned representations on ImageNet classification, PASCAL object detection, and NYU depth prediction.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper explores methods for combining multiple self-supervised learning tasks to train a single visual representation. Self-supervised learning involves training neural networks on "pretext" tasks where the training labels can be generated automatically without human annotation. The authors implement and compare four self-supervised tasks - relative position, colorization, exemplar learning, and motion segmentation. They evaluate the learned representations on ImageNet classification, PASCAL object detection, and NYU depth prediction. The authors first compare the four self-supervised tasks individually using a ResNet-101 architecture. They find that deeper networks work better for self-supervision. They then show that naively combining multiple self-supervised tasks, even via a simple multi-head architecture, improves performance over individual tasks. The gap between models pre-trained on ImageNet classification versus the four self-supervised tasks is nearly closed on PASCAL detection and eliminated on NYU depth prediction. The authors propose methods to mediate task combinations, including "input harmonization" to make inputs consistent across tasks, and lasso regularization to separate features. However, these provide only small gains. The results demonstrate the promise of multi-task self-supervised learning to reduce reliance on labeled data.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

The paper proposes a multi-task learning approach for self-supervised visual representation learning. The key points are:- They implement and compare four different self-supervised tasks (relative position prediction, colorization, exemplar learning, motion segmentation) using ResNet-101 on three evaluation benchmarks (ImageNet classification, PASCAL detection, NYU depth prediction). - They show that combining multiple self-supervised tasks in a multi-task learning setup consistently improves performance over individual tasks alone. A simple shared-trunk architecture is used where each task has its own head network.- To mitigate conflicts between tasks, they propose two techniques: 1) Input harmonization, where network inputs are modified to be more similar across tasks (e.g. converting relative position patches to grayscale). 2) Lasso regularization on linear combinations of features from different layers, which encourages factorization of representations.- In experiments, combining four self-supervised tasks nearly matches ImageNet pre-training performance on PASCAL detection and outperforms it on NYU depth prediction. The proposed conflict mitigation techniques provide small gains.In summary, the key idea is combining diverse self-supervised tasks in a multi-task learning framework to learn more general visual representations without manual labels. The results demonstrate this approach is highly effective, rivaling fully supervised pre-training.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The key points about the problem addressed in this paper are:- The paper is investigating methods for combining multiple self-supervised learning tasks to train a single visual representation. Self-supervised tasks are those where the training data does not need manual labels, such as predicting the relative position of image patches.- Current unsupervised learning methods for training neural networks are not very effective compared to supervised pre-training on large labeled datasets like ImageNet. The paper wants to explore if combining multiple self-supervised tasks can help close this gap.- The paper notes that different self-supervised tasks may learn different kinds of visual features. So combining multiple diverse tasks may lead to more general and useful feature representations compared to any single task alone. - The paper wants to provide an "apples-to-apples" comparison of different self-supervised tasks using the same deep architecture (ResNet-101). Previous works have used different architectures and evaluation tasks, making the methods hard to compare.- The paper explores both "naive" combinations of self-supervised tasks with shared trunk and task-specific heads, as well as more mediated combinations using techniques like input harmonization and lasso regularization to encourage sharing or separation of features.In summary, the key problem is how to combine multiple self-supervised learning tasks effectively to train a neural network to learn generally useful visual representations without requiring manual labeling of data. The paper explores and compares various techniques for doing this combination.
