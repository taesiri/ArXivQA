# [Sheet Music Transformer: End-To-End Optical Music Recognition Beyond   Monophonic Transcription](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art end-to-end optical music recognition (OMR) has primarily focused on monophonic music transcription. However, many real-world music scores are polyphonic (multi-voice) and complex, which current OMR methods struggle to handle without simplifications or adaptations. There is a need for OMR methods that can transcript complex polyphonic scores.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the Sheet Music Transformer (SMT), the first end-to-end OMR model designed to transcript complex polyphonic music scores without relying solely on monophonic strategies. 

- The SMT uses a Transformer-based image-to-sequence framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder extracts visual features from the input sheet music image. The decoder uses an autoregressive language model to predict a digital music encoding transcription from the encoder features.

- A key contribution is the incorporation of 2D positional encodings to retain spatial layout information from the score image, allowing the model to capture polyphonic structures.

Main Contributions:

- First end-to-end OMR model capable of transcribing complex scores beyond monophony without simplifications or adaptations.

- Introduction and evaluation of the SMT on polyphonic pianoform scores and string quartet scores. Results surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating competence on intricate music structures.

- Analysis of different encoder architectures for feature extraction from sheet music images, finding that a ConvNeXT backbone achieved the best results.

- Creation of a polyphonic adaptation of a widely-used OMR dataset to enable model evaluation beyond monophonic transcription.

Overall, the SMT represents a significant advance in end-to-end OMR capabilities and robustness for handling real-world polyphonic scores. The model shows promise in moving towards universal OMR transcription.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes the Sheet Music Transformer, the first end-to-end neural network approach for optical music recognition that is able to directly transcribe complex polyphonic musical scores into digital encodings without relying solely on monophonic transcription strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing the Sheet Music Transformer (SMT), the first image-to-sequence-based approach for music transcription that is able to deal with transcripts beyond the monophonic level. The experiments demonstrate that this approach performs better than current state-of-the-art solutions.

2) Exploring and analyzing different configurations for feature extraction in order to produce a model that is better suited to complex music layouts. 

3) Creating an adaptation of a well-known music dataset for end-to-end Optical Music Recognition (OMR) that goes beyond monophonic-level transcription.

So in summary, the main contribution is introducing the SMT model for polyphonic music transcription, evaluating it on complex music scores, and showing it outperforms existing approaches. The other contributions are analyzing different feature extractors for the SMT and creating a more complex dataset to evaluate polyphonic transcription.
