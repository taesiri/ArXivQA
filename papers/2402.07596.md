# [Sheet Music Transformer: End-To-End Optical Music Recognition Beyond   Monophonic Transcription](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- State-of-the-art end-to-end optical music recognition (OMR) has primarily focused on monophonic music transcription. However, many real-world music scores are polyphonic (multi-voice) and complex, which current OMR methods struggle to handle without simplifications or adaptations. There is a need for OMR methods that can transcript complex polyphonic scores.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose the Sheet Music Transformer (SMT), the first end-to-end OMR model designed to transcript complex polyphonic music scores without relying solely on monophonic strategies. 

- The SMT uses a Transformer-based image-to-sequence framework with an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder extracts visual features from the input sheet music image. The decoder uses an autoregressive language model to predict a digital music encoding transcription from the encoder features.

- A key contribution is the incorporation of 2D positional encodings to retain spatial layout information from the score image, allowing the model to capture polyphonic structures.

Main Contributions:

- First end-to-end OMR model capable of transcribing complex scores beyond monophony without simplifications or adaptations.

- Introduction and evaluation of the SMT on polyphonic pianoform scores and string quartet scores. Results surpass state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating competence on intricate music structures.

- Analysis of different encoder architectures for feature extraction from sheet music images, finding that a ConvNeXT backbone achieved the best results.

- Creation of a polyphonic adaptation of a widely-used OMR dataset to enable model evaluation beyond monophonic transcription.

Overall, the SMT represents a significant advance in end-to-end OMR capabilities and robustness for handling real-world polyphonic scores. The model shows promise in moving towards universal OMR transcription.
