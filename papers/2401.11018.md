# [Communication Efficient and Provable Federated Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11018)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across edge devices without sharing private user data. However, there are privacy concerns as models may still leak sensitive information.
- Users should have the "right to be forgotten" and remove their private data's impact on the FL model. This is known as federated unlearning.
- Existing federated unlearning methods have limitations in efficiency, applicability, and lack theoretical guarantees on completely removing data's influence.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes an algorithmic framework for efficient and provable federated unlearning.
- They introduce a rigorous definition of "exact" federated unlearning which requires the unlearned model to be statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without the deleted data.
- They identify total variation (TV) stability as a key property for efficient exact unlearning. This measures an FL algorithm's robustness to data changes. 
- They propose FATS, a communication-efficient and TV-stable federated averaging algorithm using local SGD and periodic averaging.
- Efficient sample-level and client-level unlearning algorithms are developed for FATS.

Main Contributions:
- First formulation of exact federated unlearning and its connection to TV stability.
- Communication-efficient FATS algorithm for learning that is TV stable.
- Matching sample and client-level unlearning algorithms for FATS.  
- Theoretical guarantees that the framework achieves exact unlearning with reasonable convergence rates for learning and unlearning.
- Empirical evaluation showing superiority over baselines in accuracy, efficiency, and unlearning efficacy.

In summary, the paper presents an end-to-end framework for efficient and provable federated unlearning to fully eliminate specific data samples' or clients' influence on the global model.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a communication-efficient framework with theoretical guarantees for federated unlearning to enable removing the influence of specific clients' data or clients themselves from the global model, while preserving utility and ensuring exact unlearning provability.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a general framework for communication efficient and provable federated unlearning. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Providing a rigorous definition of "exact" federated unlearning, which guarantees that the unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the one trained without the deleted data.

2) Identifying total variation (TV) stability as a key property for efficient exact federated unlearning. The paper shows that a TV-stable federated learning algorithm only needs to retrain a small fraction of unlearning requests.

3) Devising a TV-stable federated learning algorithm called FATS, which incorporates local SGD with periodic averaging to reduce communication cost. Matching unlearning algorithms are also developed for FATS.

4) Providing theoretical analysis to demonstrate the proposed learning and unlearning algorithms achieve exact federated unlearning with reasonable convergence rates for both the original and unlearned models.

5) Conducting comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework over existing methods. The results confirm superior performance in terms of accuracy, communication cost, computation cost, and unlearning efficacy.

In summary, the main contribution lies in being the first work to tackle communication efficiency and unlearning provability coherently for federated unlearning. The paper offers an end-to-end systematic solution with theoretical guarantees.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Federated learning - Training machine learning models collaboratively across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers while keeping data localized.

- Federated unlearning - Eliminating the impact of specific clients or data points on a federated learning model upon request, to enforce data privacy rights like the right to be forgotten.  

- Exact federated unlearning - Guaranteeing that the unlearned model is statistically indistinguishable from the model trained without the deleted data from scratch.

- Communication efficiency - Minimizing communication costs between devices and server in federated learning/unlearning frameworks.

- Total variation (TV) stability - A type of algorithmic stability measuring the sensitivity of model parameters to changes in the dataset. Used to enable efficient exact federated unlearning.

- Sample-level unlearning - Removing the effect of a specific data point from the global model.

- Client-level unlearning - Removing the effect of a specific client device's entire dataset from the global model.

- Machine unlearning - The problem of removing the effects of deleted or outdated data from a trained machine learning model.

So in summary, the key focus is developing a communication-efficient framework for federated machine unlearning that provably eliminates the influence of selected data points or client devices on the global model. Total variation stability and exact unlearning guarantees are central to this framework.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new formal definition of "exact federated unlearning". How does this definition differ from prior notions of federated unlearning in the literature? What are the key components it captures?

2. The authors propose using total variation (TV) stability as a core metric to enable efficient and provable federated unlearning. What are the intuitions behind why TV stability helps federated unlearning? What are other potential stability measures one could consider and what would be their limitations?

3. The proposed federated learning algorithm FATS incorporates elaborately designed client sampling and local mini-batch sampling strategies to achieve both sample-level and client-level TV stability. Can you explain the rationale behind how adjusting these hyper-parameters helps control the TV stability? 

4. How does the notion of TV stability guide the design of efficient unlearning algorithms for FATS? Specifically, what is the connection between TV stability parameters ρS, ρC and the probability of needing to recompute for unlearning?

5. The convergence analysis shows the average-squared gradient norm bound for FATS consists of two terms - one corresponding to the stability cost and one convergence error term. What is the trade-off captured by these two terms and how should one balance them in practice?

6. The convergence bound suggests setting local iterations E proportional to communication rounds T to the power of 1-α. What is the implication of choosing different α values between 0 and 1? What constraints need to be satisfied?

7. Compare and contrast the sample-level unlearning algorithm FATS-SU and the client-level unlearning algorithm FATS-CU. What are the key differences in the verification and recomputation strategies?

8. The time complexity analysis shows the expected running time scales linearly with the stability parameters ρS or ρC. Intuitively explain why higher stability also leads to slower unlearning.

9. The space complexity analysis suggests a simple implementation to reduce storage overhead. Can you describe this approach and explain why it still preserves the time complexity guarantees?

10. The experiments aim to evaluate accuracy, communication cost, computation cost and unlearning efficacy. What are the key results that demonstrate FATS outperforms existing federated unlearning baselines across these metrics?
