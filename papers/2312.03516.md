# [Clustering by Contour coreset and variational quantum eigensolver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03516)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers. It utilizes a new coreset method called Contour coreset specifically designed for quantum algorithms paired with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The Contour coreset overcomes limitations of existing coresets like imbalanced sampling and long construction times. It distributes coreset points evenly across clusters and dataset regions through deterministic sampling. When integrated with VQE for clustering, the Contour coreset achieved over 10\% higher accuracy and up to 0.1 lower standard deviation compared to using other coresets like BFL16, ONESHOT and Lightweight coreset. Furthermore, the paper shows mathematically and through simulations that solving the first-order Taylor approximated Hamiltonian of the 2-means clustering objective with VQE can obtain around 5\% higher accuracy than the commonly used zeroth-order approximation, especially for unevenly distributed datasets. Extensive simulations demonstrated the VQE paired with Contour coreset outperforms existing quantum clustering approaches with QAOA and other coresets. The proposed techniques in this paper highlight the potential for customized coresets and algorithms to significantly boost quantum algorithm performance.
