# [Clustering by Contour coreset and variational quantum eigensolver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03516)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current methods for solving k-means clustering on quantum computers combine pre-existing classical coresets with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). However, these coresets are not designed for quantum algorithms leading to poor accuracy.
- There is no coreset tailored to the characteristics of quantum algorithms. Existing coresets rely on probabilistic sampling which performs poorly with the limited qubits in quantum computers.
- QAOA requires deep circuits which are noisy and struggle with parameter optimization in NISQ devices.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a new coreset called Contour Coreset specifically designed for quantum k-means clustering. It uses deterministic sampling to evenly distribute coreset points across the dataset.
- Solve the clustering problem with Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) which is more suitable for NISQ devices compared to QAOA.
- Derive the first-order Taylor approximation of the Hamiltonian to better handle uneven cluster sizes.

Main Contributions:
- Propose VQE+Contour Coreset approach that outperforms QAOA+Coreset methods in accuracy (10% higher) and standard deviation (up to 0.1 lower)
- Develop Contour Coreset tailored to quantum algorithms that uses deterministic sampling and distributes points evenly across clusters
- Show that first-order Hamiltonian with VQE achieves higher accuracy than zero-order, especially for uneven clusters
- Identify optimal VQE parameters like optimizer, entanglement strategy, number of repetitions etc.
- Demonstrate robustness of VQE approach in presence of noise compared to fluctuations in QAOA

In summary, the paper presents a superior quantum technique for k-means clustering by designing a new coreset matched to quantum constraints and leveraging VQE's noise resilience. The proposed techniques significantly advance quantum machine learning capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers by combining a tailored Contour coreset technique with the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, demonstrating higher accuracy and consistency compared to existing methods involving quantum approximate optimization algorithm and generic coresets.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a new coreset method called "Contour coreset" specifically designed for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers. The Contour coreset is optimized to work well with limited qubits and unevenly distributed datasets.

2. It shows that combining the Contour coreset with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm achieves higher accuracy and lower standard deviation in solving the 2-means clustering problem compared to using existing coresets with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). 

3. It derives the first-order Taylor approximated Hamiltonian for the 2-means to MAX-CUT transformation and shows that solving this Hamiltonian with VQE leads to higher clustering accuracy compared to the commonly used zeroth-order approximation, especially for uneven datasets.

4. It analyzes the optimal parameters and settings for implementing the VQE algorithm to solve the clustering problem, including the number of qubits, optimizer, entanglement strategy etc.

5. It demonstrates the effectiveness of using a quantum-tailored coreset technique like Contour coreset to boost the performance of quantum algorithms compared to just using off-the-shelf classical coresets.

In summary, the key innovation is the development of the Contour coreset specifically for quantum clustering and showing its advantages combined with VQE to outperform existing quantum methods for this problem.

9. The paper empirically shows improved performance of the Contour coreset but does not provide a theoretical analysis. What kinds of mathematical bounds or properties would strengthen the validity of this new technique?
