# [Clustering by Contour coreset and variational quantum eigensolver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03516)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers. It utilizes a new coreset method called Contour coreset specifically designed for quantum algorithms paired with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The Contour coreset overcomes limitations of existing coresets like imbalanced sampling and long construction times. It distributes coreset points evenly across clusters and dataset regions through deterministic sampling. When integrated with VQE for clustering, the Contour coreset achieved over 10\% higher accuracy and up to 0.1 lower standard deviation compared to using other coresets like BFL16, ONESHOT and Lightweight coreset. Furthermore, the paper shows mathematically and through simulations that solving the first-order Taylor approximated Hamiltonian of the 2-means clustering objective with VQE can obtain around 5\% higher accuracy than the commonly used zeroth-order approximation, especially for unevenly distributed datasets. Extensive simulations demonstrated the VQE paired with Contour coreset outperforms existing quantum clustering approaches with QAOA and other coresets. The proposed techniques in this paper highlight the potential for customized coresets and algorithms to significantly boost quantum algorithm performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers, combining a custom Contour coreset technique and variational quantum eigensolver algorithm which achieves higher accuracy and consistency compared to existing quantum methods using off-the-shelf coresets and quantum approximate optimization algorithm.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a new coreset technique called "Contour coreset" that is specifically designed for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers. The Contour coreset overcomes limitations of existing coreset methods when applied to quantum algorithms, such as imbalance sampling and lack of thorough sampling with limited coreset points.

2) It shows that combining the Contour coreset with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm outperforms existing approaches of using QAOA and other coresets. Specifically, the VQE + Contour coreset approach achieves over 10% higher accuracy and up to 0.1 lower standard deviation compared to QAOA + other coresets across a variety of datasets.

3) It identifies the optimal settings for solving the 2-means clustering problem using the VQE algorithm, such as using the first-order Taylor approximated Hamiltonian, the ISRES optimizer, linear entanglement strategy etc. 

4) It derives and tests using the second-order Taylor approximated Hamiltonian with the VQE algorithm, which has not been done in prior work. Although solving the second-order Hamiltonian did not improve performance, the derivation itself is a new contribution.

In summary, the key innovation is in proposing a quantum-tailored coreset method and showing empirically that it outperforms existing techniques when combined with VQE for solving the 2-means clustering problem on quantum computers.
