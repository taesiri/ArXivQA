# [Multi-Cultural Commonsense Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10689)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to appropriately react to social and cultural conventions and norms. This limits their capabilities for tasks like human-computer dialogue that require cultural awareness and sensitivity.  
- Prior work has collected some cultural knowledge resources, but these have very limited scope and scale (largest is Candle KB with 60K assertions).

Proposed Solution - \ourmethod{}:  
- A 2-stage methodology to efficiently distill large-scale, high-quality cultural commonsense knowledge (CCSK) from LLMs using iterative prompting and consolidation.

Key Points:
- Leverages GPT-3.5's pretraining corpus by prompting for assertions about concepts and cultures separately. New concepts/cultures from outputs are fed back iteratively to increase coverage.
- Consolidates raw asserted candidates via clustering and abstractive summarization to reduce noise, stereotypes and redundancies. Frequency signals from clusters provide assertion rankings.

Results and Contributions:  
- Obtains 167K high-quality CCSK assertions covering 30K concepts and 11K cultural groups, far surpassing prior resources.
- Augmenting dialogue systems with \ourmethod{} CCSK significantly improves response quality, specificity and cultural sensitivity based on human evaluation.
- Release CCSK dataset and 5K narrative-dialogue pairs for further research into cultural dialogues.

In summary, the key novelty is a scalable methodology for distilling explicit, transparent and controllable cultural knowledge from language models, with demonstrations of value for enhancing cultural awareness in conversational AI systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a methodology called Mango for efficiently distilling high-quality, culture-specific commonsense knowledge from large language models, obtaining 167K assertions that surpass prior resources and can improve the cultural sensitivity of dialogue systems when explicitly injected.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The \ourmethod{} methodology for efficiently distilling cultural commonsense knowledge (CCSK) from large language models (LLMs), at high precision and recall.

2. Running the \ourmethod{} method with GPT-3.5 to obtain 167K assertions for 30K concepts and 11K cultures, substantially surpassing prior CCSK resources in size and quality. 

3. An extrinsic evaluation showing that injecting \ourmethod{} assertions significantly improves the specificity and cultural sensitivity of responses from language models in intercultural dialogue tasks, as judged by human annotators.

So in summary, the paper presents a new methodology to extract high-quality cultural commonsense knowledge from LLMs, constructs a large-scale CCSK dataset using this methodology, and shows the usefulness of this knowledge in improving language models for intercultural dialogues.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Cultural commonsense knowledge (CCSK)
- Large language models (LLMs) 
- Knowledge distillation
- Intercultural dialogues
- GPT-3.5
- Assertion generation
- Assertion consolidation 
- Assertion clustering
- Cultures
- Concepts
- Extrinsic evaluation
- Next utterance generation
- Full dialogue generation

The paper presents the \ourmethod{} methodology to efficiently distill high-quality and high-coverage cultural commonsense knowledge from large language models. It conducts intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, using GPT-3.5 to generate a CCSK dataset surpassing prior resources. Experiments show injecting CCSK into prompts can improve performance of LLMs on intercultural dialogue tasks. The key terms reflect the main themes and contributions around cultural knowledge acquisition, dialogue systems, and leveraging capabilities of LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What are the key differences between the assertion generation and assertion consolidation phases in the proposed CCSK distillation workflow? What is the purpose of having these two distinct phases?

2. How does the proposed method systematically capture more diverse cultural groups compared to prior work? What are some examples of the new types of cultural groups captured? 

3. Why does the proposed method prompt the LLM separately for concepts and cultures instead of giving concept-culture pairs? What are the advantages of this approach?

4. How does iterative assertion generation with new concepts and cultures in each round lead to higher coverage? Provide some examples of new concepts or cultures generated in later rounds.

5. Explain the 3-step divide-and-conquer clustering approach used in assertion consolidation and why it is more efficient than clustering all assertions together.

6. What is the purpose of generating cluster representative sentences? How does this provide signals about the relative importance of assertions?

7. Analyze and compare the strengths and weaknesses of using web-based extraction vs LLMs for CCSK acquisition. Under what circumstances would each approach be preferred?

8. How suitable is the proposed embedding-based method for retrieving relevant CCSK assertions to augment dialogue systems? What enhancements could make the retrieval more contextually precise?  

9. Critically evaluate the human evaluation protocol used for the dialogue tasks. What other metrics could be used to complement the human judgments?

10. Discuss the broader societal impacts, both positive and negative, of developing large-scale computational models of cultural knowledge. What steps could be taken to mitigate risks?
