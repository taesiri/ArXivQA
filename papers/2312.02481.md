# [Learning to Holistically Detect Bridges from Large-Size VHR Remote   Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02481)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes GLH-Bridge, a large-scale dataset for holistic bridge detection in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery (RSIs). GLH-Bridge comprises 6,000 VHR RSIs with sizes ranging from 2048x2048 to 16,384x16,384 pixels, sampled globally across bridges spanning diverse backgrounds. It contains nearly 60K bridges manually annotated with oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) and horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs), surpassing existing datasets in terms of image size, instance quantity and diversity. The authors argue that current methods struggle on large-size VHR RSIs due to GPU memory limitations and use cropping strategies causing label fragmentation, motivating the new task of holistic bridge detection. To address this, they propose the HBD-Net with a separate detector-based feature fusion (SDFF) architecture and shape-sensitive sample re-weighting (SSRW) strategy. SDFF utilizes separate detectors for different scales to extract multi-scale features, while SSRW balances the regression loss to handle extreme aspect ratios. Based on GLH-Bridge, benchmarks for OBB and HBB tasks are established, with HBD-Net achieving the highest accuracy. Cross-dataset generalization experiments also showcase GLH-Bridge's strong generalization ability. Overall, this paper makes key contributions of the large-scale GLH-Bridge dataset to enable holistic bridge detection research, the HBD-Net tailored for this novel task, and extensive benchmarks demonstrating empirical effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a large-scale bridge detection dataset of 6,000 large VHR remote sensing images spanning 2K to 16K pixels with 59K annotated bridges across diverse backgrounds, and an efficient holistic bridge detection network leveraging separate detectors and inter-layer feature fusion to handle such large images on a single GPU.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes GLH-Bridge, the first large-scale dataset for bridge detection in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. The dataset contains 6,000 VHR images with sizes up to 16,384x16,384 pixels and over 59,000 manually annotated bridges across diverse backgrounds.

2. It presents a new challenging and meaningful task - holistic bridge detection in large-size VHR remote sensing images. This requires detecting bridges holistically without cutting them off due to image cropping limitations.

3. It proposes an efficient network called HBD-Net tailored for holistic bridge detection in large images. HBD-Net has a separate detector-based feature fusion (SDFF) architecture to handle large images and a shape-sensitive sample re-weighting (SSRW) strategy to balance regression loss.

4. It establishes benchmark results on the GLH-Bridge dataset for both oriented bounding box (OBB) and horizontal bounding box (HBB) tasks. Experiments show HBD-Net achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.

5. It demonstrates through cross-dataset experiments that models trained on GLH-Bridge generalize well to other datasets, validating its generalization capability.

In summary, the key contribution is the large-scale GLH-Bridge dataset and the holistic bridge detection task and method it enables.
