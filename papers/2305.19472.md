# [PlaSma: Making Small Language Models Better Procedural Knowledge Models   for (Counterfactual) Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19472)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can we develop smaller, more efficient language models with strong capabilities for procedural and counterfactual planning?

The key points related to this question appear to be:

- Procedural planning (decomposing high-level goals into coherent, ordered steps) is an important task but currently relies on large, expensive models. 

- The authors propose a framework called PlaSma to impart planning abilities to smaller LMs through "symbolic procedural knowledge distillation" and a "verifier-guided decoding algorithm."

- They introduce a new task called "counterfactual planning" which requires revising plans to accommodate realistic constrained situations. 

- Experiments show their approach allows much smaller LMs (100s of millions of parameters vs billions) to match or exceed the performance of larger teacher models on planning tasks.

So in summary, the central hypothesis appears to be that with the right training framework, distillation, and inference algorithms, orders of magnitude smaller LMs can be competitive with giant LMs on procedural and counterfactual planning. The paper aims to demonstrate this capability.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can smaller language models be endowed with procedural knowledge and (counterfactual) planning capabilities that are comparable to large language models?

The key points related to this question are:

- The paper introduces an approach called PlaSma that uses symbolic procedural knowledge distillation and an inference-time algorithm to impart planning abilities to small language models. 

- The authors argue that while large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on procedural planning tasks, their computational costs and issues with reproducibility limit wider adoption.

- PlaSma aims to show that much smaller, more accessible models can be competitive with large models on planning through knowledge distillation and tailored decoding.

- The paper proposes a novel counterfactual planning task that requires adapting plans to constrained, real-world situations. This tests models' ability to reason about counterfactuals.

- Through experiments on planning and counterfactual planning, the authors demonstrate that their distilled small models (770M to 11B parameters) improve over the original large teacher model and approach the performance of models 16x larger.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that smaller, more efficient models can match large model performance on planning tasks when equipped with the right training framework and inference algorithms. The results provide evidence that this is achievable through the proposed PlaSma approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Presenting a novel framework called PlaSma for imparting procedural planning capabilities in small language models, through symbolic procedural knowledge distillation and an inference-time decoding algorithm. 

2. Introducing a new task called Counterfactual Planning that involves revising a plan to accommodate realistic counterfactual scenarios and constraints.

3. Creating a large-scale procedural planning dataset called CoPlan through knowledge verbalization from large language models. The dataset contains goals, plans, conditions, and counterfactual plans.

4. Showing through experiments that much smaller models (770M-11B parameters) distilled using the proposed framework can compete with and often surpass their larger teacher models on procedural planning tasks, including the proposed counterfactual planning.

5. Demonstrating the application of the distilled small models to embodied agents through significantly improved planning performance in a simulated household environment compared to prior work using GPT-3.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel framework to impart procedural planning abilities in small LMs, which includes multi-task distillation objectives, guided decoding, a new counterfactual planning task, and an accompanying diverse procedural planning dataset. The results show smaller models can achieve comparable or better performance than large models on planning tasks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in procedural planning:

- The focus on using smaller, more accessible models sets it apart from much prior work that relies on large language models like GPT-3. Developing methods to impart planning abilities to smaller models could make the technology more widely usable.

- Introducing the novel counterfactual planning and plan revision tasks is an interesting extension beyond the standard goal-based planning setup. Generating plans that can adapt to changed situations is an important direction.

- The overall framework of knowledge distillation and inference-time decoding seems quite unique for this task. Many prior approaches formulate planning as a text generation problem and don't incorporate additional structures.

- The proposed dataset collection process leverages LLMs in a creative way to obtain a large dataset without expensive human annotation. This could enable scaling up the data for future research.

- Evaluation in the VirtualHome simulated environment demonstrates the applicability of the method to embodied agents. This is a useful validation of real-world viability.

- In terms of limitations, there isn't much analysis of the diversity or coverage of the collected goals and plans. Ensuring variety is important.

Overall, the work introduces valuable innovations in terms of the tasks, models, and methodology. If the promises around accessibility hold up, it could expand applications of AI planning technology. Testing generalization and biases will be important future directions.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new approach called PlaSma for imparting procedural planning capabilities to small language models. The key ideas are symbolic procedural knowledge distillation and an inference-time decoding algorithm. For knowledge distillation, a large teacher model first generates procedural knowledge in the form of goals, plans, conditions and counterfactual plans. This data is then used to train smaller student models via task-specific and multi-task distillation objectives. To enable more structured reasoning during inference, they incorporate a step-wise verifier into the decoding process to guide beam search towards more coherent and accurate plans. The approach is evaluated on original and proposed counterfactual planning tasks. The results show that much smaller models can effectively compete and often surpass the performance of their larger teacher models and baselines like GPT-3. Overall, the work provides a promising direction for developing smaller yet powerful models for procedural planning through symbolic knowledge transfer and inference-time algorithms.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents PlaSma, a novel approach to impart procedural planning capabilities in small language models. PlaSma uses symbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the implicit knowledge in small models and an inference-time algorithm to enable more structured reasoning. The authors introduce three procedural planning tasks: goal-based planning, counterfactual planning, and plan revision. For data collection, they use GPT-3's few-shot abilities to generate a large dataset of goals, plans, conditions and counterfactual plans called CoPlan. This dataset is used to train smaller student models via task-specific and multi-task distillation objectives. To improve the coherence and logical sequencing of the generated plans, they incorporate a step-wise verifier into beam search during decoding. Experiments show that much smaller models distilled with PlaSma outperform their larger teacher models in both standard and counterfactual planning settings. The best 11B parameter student matches human performance and is competitive with 175B models on the goal-based planning task. In counterfactual planning, the distilled student achieves 93% validity according to humans. Overall, PlaSma provides an effective approach to impart planning abilities in small, accessible language models through symbolic knowledge distillation and inference-time algorithms.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents PlaSma, a novel framework to impart planning abilities to small language models through symbolic procedural knowledge distillation and an inference-time decoding algorithm. The authors first collect a large-scale procedural planning dataset, CoPlan, by eliciting plans, conditions, and counterfactual plans from large teacher models.
