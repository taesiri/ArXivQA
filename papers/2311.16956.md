# [Adaptive Step Sizes for Preconditioned Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16956)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for adaptively controlling the step size in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms. The key insight is to leverage estimable quantities related to the nonlinearity (smoothness) of the optimization problem as well as the variance in the stochastic gradient directions. Specifically, the authors develop techniques to numerically estimate the Lipschitz constant for the gradient as well as the local variance, using only information available during the SGD iterations. These estimates are then combined in a particular way to determine an adaptive step size for each iteration. Theoretical analysis shows that this adaptive scheme enjoys strong convergence guarantees for quadratic problems, including linear convergence in the interpolating case and sublinear convergence in the non-interpolating case. Practical experiments on quadratic problems and image classification tasks demonstrate that the method is truly adaptive, matches or exceeds state-of-the-art convergence rates, and requires almost no hyperparameter tuning. A key advantage is the ability to automatically adapt to unknown problem parameters like strong convexity. The framework is also compatible with preconditioning techniques. Overall, this paper presents an efficient, adaptive approach to controlling step size in SGD that is simple to implement yet provides strong theoretical and empirical performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive step sizes in stochastic gradient descent by utilizing numerically traceable quantities - the Lipschitz constant for gradients and a notion of local variance in search directions - to obtain an algorithm with provable convergence guarantees on quadratic problems that exhibits truly problem-adaptive behavior on classical image classification tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions:

1. It proposes a novel approach to adaptive step sizes in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by utilizing quantities that can be numerically estimated during training - specifically the Lipschitz constant for gradients and a notion of local variance in the search directions.

2. Based on a modified variance bound, it develops an adaptive SGD algorithm with step sizes independent of the strong convexity parameter. It shows this algorithm converges linearly to a stagnation level proportional to the noise at the minimizer. 

3. It introduces an additional estimator for the local variance and incorporates it into the step size selection. This allows for an algorithm with robust convergence guarantees - linear convergence in the interpolating case and convergence of order 1/k in the non-interpolating case.

4. It provides both theoretical convergence results for quadratic problems and experimental validation on image classification tasks. The adaptive nature of the method is demonstrated on various problems without hyperparameter tuning.

5. The framework developed allows these adaptive step size selection techniques to be incorporated into stochastic second-order methods using preconditioning.

In summary, the main contribution is a principled, adaptive approach to controlling SGD step sizes based on numerically estimable quantities. This results in a nearly hyperparameter-free algorithm with strong convergence guarantees and experimental performance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the adaptive step size control method for stochastic gradient descent proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes adapting the step size based on estimating the Lipschitz constant L and the variance in the search direction. What is the intuition behind using these specific quantities to control the step size? How do they relate to the convergence behavior of SGD?

2. Explain the variance bound proposed in Lemma 3 and how it differs from previous bounds. Why is a variance bound that does not depend on the strong convexity parameter μ desirable? 

3. The paper distinguishes between the "interpolating" and "non-interpolating" settings based on the noise at the minimizer. How do these two settings lead to qualitatively different convergence behavior for SGD? How does the proposed adaptive scheme address both cases?

4. Discuss the heuristic behind using the difference between $f_{\xi_k}(w_{k+1})$ and $f_{\xi_{k+1}}(w_{k+1})$ to estimate the local variance. What assumptions does this rely on and what are its limitations?

5. The exponential smoothing technique is used to obtain stable estimates of the key quantities over time. Explain this approach and discuss how the choice of the damping factor γ affects the estimation.

6. The paper mentions using a "global phase" and "local phase" for nonconvex problems like neural networks. Explain the motivation and implementation of this idea to leverage SGD's ability to escape local minima early on. 

7. Theoretical results are proved for quadratic stochastic optimization problems. What are the challenges in extending the analysis to more complex nonconvex problems like neural networks?

8. Discuss some of the practical safeguarding approaches mentioned such as rejecting steps, upper/lower limits on estimates, and fallbacks to line search. How robust are these in practice?

9. What are some ways the basic SGD algorithm could be enhanced using ideas like momentum, variance reduction, or second order methods? Would the adaptive scheme integrate well?

10. Quantitative comparisons against optimally tuned SGD were mentioned as future work. What experiments would you suggest to benchmark the performance and quantify the reduction in hyperparameter tuning?
