# [Fusion of Diffusion Weighted MRI and Clinical Data for Predicting   Functional Outcome after Acute Ischemic Stroke with Deep Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Accurately predicting long-term functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke is challenging but important for facilitating early intervention and mitigating patient/family burden. Physician assessments vary and models relying solely on clinical data or brain images have limitations. There is a need for better prognostic models combining imaging and clinical data.

Methods:
The authors propose a deep neural network for multimodal fusion, combining diffusion-weighted MRI and 62 clinical variables, to predict disability at 3 months post-stroke. The model has two stages. Stage 1 focuses on representation learning using contrastive losses applied separately on individual modalities (ADC, DWI images; clinical data) as well as jointly after hierarchical fusion. This results in discriminative features that cluster data points from the same patient outcome closer together. Stage 2 transfers learned features for classification via a convolutional or fully-connected layer. 

Dataset: 
3297 acute ischemic stroke patients with 3-month modified Rankin Scale (disability outcomes) from a hospital in Taiwan.

Key Results:
The model achieves AUC 0.87, F1-score 0.80, accuracy 80.45% on test data, outperforming past multimodal fusion models for stroke outcome prediction and vision/medical imaging tasks. Ablations highlight benefits of contrastive losses and fusion. Diffusion-weighted MRI can effectively replace less generalizable NIHSS with comparable accuracy when combined with other clinical variables.

Contributions:  
1) Novel hierarchical fusion strategy for multimodal representation and classification learning  
2) Demonstrates state-of-the-art prognostication performance on a large real-world acute ischemic stroke dataset
3) Shows potential for diffusion-weighted MRI to substitute physician assessments prone to variability
