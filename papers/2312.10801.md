# [Scope Compliance Uncertainty Estimate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10801)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates limitations of SafeML, an approach for monitoring machine learning models at runtime by statistically comparing training data and operational data. SafeML has three main limitations: 
1) Reliance on design parameters that affect robustness 
2) Assumptions of data distributions  
3) High computational complexity 

Proposed Solution:
To address these limitations, the paper proposes three main contributions:

1) Non-parametric bootstrap power analysis: Removes distribution assumptions by using bootstrapping to determine number of samples needed for reliable statistical distance measures between datasets.

2) New ECF-based distance measure (Epps-Singleton Test): Based on empirical characteristic function rather than empirical cumulative distribution function to increase computation speed.

3) Scope Compliance Uncertainty Estimators (SCUEs): Convert binary SafeML output to continuous uncertainty estimate that is bounded and can be integrated with other uncertainty methods. SCUEs correlate statistical distance measures on calibration data with model inaccuracy.

Experiments: 
The proposals are evaluated on image classification using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. The bootstrap power analysis is validated on synthetic data. SCUEs are constructed for different corruption types and evaluated versus accuracy distributions. SCUEs achieve uncertainty estimation, outperforming previous SafeML thresholds.

Main Contributions:
1) Non-parametric power analysis method
2) New ECF-based statistical distance measure
3) Continuous uncertainty estimators improving on SafeML limitations

The paper enhances SafeML to make it more robust, efficient and compatible with other safety methods through these contributions.
