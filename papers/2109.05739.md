# CEM: Commonsense-aware Empathetic Response Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we leverage commonsense knowledge to enhance empathetic response generation in dialogue systems?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) In addition to identifying the user's emotion, cognitive understanding of the user's situation is also important for generating empathetic responses. 2) Providing dialogue systems with commonsense knowledge could help them better understand the user's situation and feelings.3) This additional commonsense-based understanding can lead to more informative and empathetic responses compared to models that mainly rely on detecting emotion.Specifically, the authors propose that commonsense knowledge can be used to draw more implications about the user's reactions, intentions, desires etc. based on what they explicitly share. Gaining this additional affective and cognitive information can then allow dialogue systems to express empathy in a more human-like manner.The paper introduces CEM, a novel empathetic dialogue model that leverages commonsense inferences from ATOMIC to acquire additional user state knowledge. It demonstrates through experiments on the EmpatheticDialogues dataset that CEM can generate more diverse, relevant and empathetic responses compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.In summary, the central hypothesis is that commonsense reasoning, in conjunction with emotion recognition, is an effective technique to enhance empathetic response generation in open-domain dialogue systems. The paper aims to demonstrate this through the proposal and evaluation of CEM.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. They propose to leverage commonsense knowledge to improve the understanding of interlocutors' situations and feelings, which is an important part of cognitive empathy. 2. They introduce CEM, a novel approach for empathetic response generation that uses various types of commonsense reasoning to enhance the empathy expression in generated responses.3. They evaluate CEM on the EmpatheticDialogues benchmark dataset and show through both automatic and human evaluations that it can generate more informative and empathetic responses compared to previous methods. In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating how incorporating commonsense knowledge into empathetic response generation can lead to better modeling of cognitive empathy and thus generate more natural and human-like empathetic responses. The proposed CEM model serves as a concrete instantiation of this idea.
