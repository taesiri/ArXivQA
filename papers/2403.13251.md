# [A Rule-Compliance Path Planner for Lane-Merge Scenarios Based on   Responsibility-Sensitive Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13251)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Lane merging is a critical and challenging task for autonomous vehicles (AVs), requiring complex decision-making amidst dynamic traffic conditions. 
- Current AV lane merging algorithms have issues like trajectory oscillation and ambiguity in right-of-way, due to limited prediction and adaptation capabilities.
- Additional challenges come from interpreting unpredictable human driver behaviors and variances in traffic laws across regions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a rule-compliance path planning (RCPP) framework to address some of these challenges and promote safer, more efficient lane merging.

- An extended Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model is introduced to clarify right-of-way priority and define desired cooperative commands between vehicles.

- A potential field (PF) based sigmoid planner is then used to generate smooth lane change trajectories that eliminate amplitude of trajectory oscillations.

Key Contributions:
- The extended RSS model establishes rules to regulate both non-cooperative and cooperative lane merge behaviors between vehicles, aiming to resolve right-of-way ambiguity.

- The PF-based sigmoid planner enables generation of more stable, efficient merge trajectories compared to traditional isotropic potential field methods.

- Simulations demonstrate the RCPP framework achieves superior performance over previous approaches in metrics like merging time, path length and eliminating trajectory oscillation issues.

- By enhancing predictability and rule compliance, the RCPP approach helps progress AVs towards safer integration with human drivers under prevailing traffic systems.

In summary, the paper addresses key challenges in AV lane merging through a novel RCPP method combining an extended RSS model and PF-based sigmoid planner to deliver more safe, efficient and stable merge behaviors.
