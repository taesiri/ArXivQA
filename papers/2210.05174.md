# [BoxTeacher: Exploring High-Quality Pseudo Labels for Weakly Supervised   Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05174)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve weakly supervised instance segmentation using only bounding box annotations. Specifically, the authors explore whether high-quality pseudo mask labels generated from box-supervised methods can be leveraged to train instance segmentation models more effectively. 

The key hypothesis is that while box-supervised methods can produce some high-quality masks, simply using these pseudo masks in a naive self-training approach is not very effective due to issues with noisy/low-quality masks hurting training. The authors propose a new training framework called BoxTeacher to better exploit these pseudo mask labels.

In summary, the main research question is: can high-quality pseudo masks generated from box supervision be exploited to significantly improve weakly supervised instance segmentation? The authors propose BoxTeacher as a method to effectively leverage these noisy pseudo mask labels.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting BoxTeacher, an end-to-end training framework for high-performance weakly supervised instance segmentation. The key ideas are:

- It leverages a sophisticated teacher model to generate high-quality pseudo mask labels from box annotations, along with mask-aware confidence scores to estimate the mask quality. 

- It proposes noise-aware losses (pixel loss and affinity loss) to train the student model on noisy pseudo masks while reducing the impact of low-quality masks.

- The student and teacher are trained collaboratively - the student provides gradients to update the teacher via exponential moving average, while the teacher generates better pseudo labels to improve the student. This mutual improvement pushes the limits of box-supervised instance segmentation.

- Experiments show BoxTeacher significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art box-supervised methods on COCO, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets. It narrows the gap with fully supervised methods, achieving 36.5 mask AP on COCO using ResNet-101 backbone.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting an effective end-to-end training approach to exploit noisy pseudo masks for weakly supervised instance segmentation, through collaborative learning between the teacher and student models. The proposed techniques enable much improved performance from box annotations alone.
