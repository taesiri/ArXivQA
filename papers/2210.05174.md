# [BoxTeacher: Exploring High-Quality Pseudo Labels for Weakly Supervised   Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05174)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to improve weakly supervised instance segmentation using only bounding box annotations. Specifically, the authors explore whether high-quality pseudo mask labels generated from box-supervised methods can be leveraged to train instance segmentation models more effectively. 

The key hypothesis is that while box-supervised methods can produce some high-quality masks, simply using these pseudo masks in a naive self-training approach is not very effective due to issues with noisy/low-quality masks hurting training. The authors propose a new training framework called BoxTeacher to better exploit these pseudo mask labels.

In summary, the main research question is: can high-quality pseudo masks generated from box supervision be exploited to significantly improve weakly supervised instance segmentation? The authors propose BoxTeacher as a method to effectively leverage these noisy pseudo mask labels.
