# [Compositionality in algorithms for smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13865)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main goals of this paper are:1. To provide a categorical perspective on the Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) algorithm for hidden Markov models using the concept of optics from category theory. 2. To prove compositionality results that show different ways of composing the building blocks of BFFG correspond to equivalent optics. Specifically, the main results are Theorem 3 on equivalence for sequential composition and Theorem 4 on equivalence for parallel composition.3. To connect the compositional structure of BFFG to sampling from the smoothing distribution in a hidden Markov model. Theorems 3 and 4 imply compositionality for common sampling algorithms like Forward Filtering Backward Sampling.In summary, the paper aims to give a categorical understanding of BFFG and related smoothing algorithms, establishing formal compositionality results using the language of optics. This provides a foundation for modular implementation and helps clarify the algorithms' structure. The categorical perspective abstracts away details to focus on compositionality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a categorical perspective on the Backward Filtering Forward Guiding (BFFG) algorithm for Bayesian smoothing in state space models. The key contributions are:1. BFFG is interpreted as an optic, a concept from category theory for modeling systems with bidirectional data flow. The backward and forward passes in BFFG correspond to the backward and forward maps in an optic.2. Compositionality results are proven for BFFG. In particular, it is shown that composing the building blocks of BFFG sequentially or in parallel results in equivalent optics. This allows flexible composition while preserving the overall smoothing distribution.3. The results are connected to well-known algorithms like the Kalman filter and Forward Filtering Backward Sampling. Compositionality for these algorithms follows directly from the main results.4. BFFG is also analyzed under a sampling perspective, where weighted samples are propagated rather than measures. This is useful for Bayesian computation. Again, compositionality is established.5. Overall, the categorical viewpoint provides a clean framework for understanding BFFG and its compositional properties. Representing BFFG as an optic elucidates its bidirectional data flow and makes implementation using basic categorical concepts straightforward. The theoretical results on compositionality guarantee consistency across different compositions.In summary, this paper demonstrates the benefits of applying category theory to elucidate the structure of BFFG and related Bayesian smoothing algorithms. The categorical abstractions allow focusing on the essence of these procedures.
