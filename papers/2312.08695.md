# [CPST: Comprehension-Preserving Style Transfer for Multi-Modal Narratives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08695)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces the concept of comprehension-preserving style transfer (CPST) for multi-modal visual narratives like comics and manga. It highlights the challenges of style transfer for such media due to distinct layout, visual, and text style features that interact in complex ways to communicate narrative meaning. The authors propose a framework that involves separating the visual scenes, text, and layout into separate channels with masked images, applying parallel neural style transfer modules to each channel, and blending the results while preserving panel sequence coherence. They create an annotated dataset combining Western comics and Japanese manga, and evaluate style transfer results using visual story cloze tests to measure preservation of inter-panel semantic coherence. Key findings show that narrative comprehension models perform better on style transferred sequences when content masking and composition similarity matching are used compared to direct style transfer. This work sets a baseline for style transfer that considers narrative semantics in visual storytelling mediums like comics and manga, with potential impact on interactive narratives and camera control for story environments.
