# [Sparse but Strong: Crafting Adversarially Robust Graph Lottery Tickets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06568)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an adversarially robust graph sparsification (ARGS) technique to generate graph lottery tickets that are robust against structure poisoning attacks on graphs. The authors first analyze existing lottery ticket techniques and show their vulnerability to such attacks. They then study the impact of attacks on graph properties, finding that adversarial edges tend to connect nodes with very different features, unlike natural graphs. The ARGS method incorporates multiple loss terms to remove both adversarial and redundant edges - a cross-entropy loss on train nodes captures adversarial edges around labeled data, a feature smoothness loss removes edges between dissimilar nodes, and a cross-entropy loss guided by an MLP classifier on test nodes provides extra signal. ARGS iteratively prunes edges and model parameters based on this loss. The resulting sparse graph and model subnet can be retrained using both train and test nodes for improved robustness. Evaluations demonstrate ARGS effectively removes adversarial edges and allows the retraining of lottery tickets that are more robust to poisoning attacks versus standard lottery tickets.
