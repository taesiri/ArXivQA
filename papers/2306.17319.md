# [ReMaX: Relaxing for Better Training on Efficient Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17319)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we improve the training of mask transformers for efficient panoptic segmentation?More specifically, the authors aim to address the issue that the training objective of panoptic segmentation leads to highly unbalanced losses, making it difficult to train mask transformer models, especially efficient architectures. Their central hypothesis is that adding relaxation to the mask and class predictions during training can help stabilize and accelerate training for panoptic segmentation with mask transformers.The two key ways they propose to add relaxation are:1) Relaxation on Masks (ReMask): Using an auxiliary semantic segmentation branch during training to calibrate the panoptic mask predictions and reduce false positives.2) Relaxation on Classes (ReClass): Softening the one-hot class labels by weighting them based on predicted mask overlaps with ground truth masks.Through these relaxation techniques, the authors aim to improve training stability, speed, and performance for efficient mask transformers on panoptic segmentation tasks. Evaluating the impact of these proposed relaxation methods is the central focus of this paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is introducing two novel techniques called Relaxation on Masks (ReMask) and Relaxation on Classes (ReClass) to better train mask transformer models for efficient panoptic segmentation. Specifically, the key ideas are:- ReMask adds an auxiliary semantic segmentation branch during training to help guide and stabilize the learning of panoptic segmentation. This relaxes the training by reducing false positive mask losses.- ReClass softens the one-hot class labels for each predicted mask based on its overlap with ground truth masks. This accounts for the fact that predicted masks may cover multiple classes during training. - By applying these simple relaxations during training, without increasing inference cost, the method achieves significantly faster convergence and better accuracy.- ReMaX achieves new state-of-the-art results for efficient models on COCO, ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets, especially for mobile backbones like MobileNetV3.In summary, the core contribution is proposing training-time mask and class relaxations to enable better learning of panoptic segmentation for efficient models, and achieving superior results. The relaxations help to stabilize and speed up training convergence.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents ReMaX, a new method to relax the training of mask transformers for efficient panoptic segmentation by adding auxiliary branches for semantic segmentation prediction and softened ground truth classes, which improves performance and training stability without increasing inference cost.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in the field of panoptic segmentation:- The paper focuses on improving the training of mask transformer models for panoptic segmentation, especially for efficient models. This is an important area of research as efficient panoptic segmentation has many real-world applications.- The paper proposes two novel training relaxation techniques called ReMask and ReClass to stabilize and accelerate training. These techniques help address the issue of unbalanced losses during training that many prior mask transformer papers have faced.- The paper shows state-of-the-art results on COCO, ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets using efficient models like MobileNetV3. Many prior works focused on bigger models so this work helps democratize panoptic segmentation. - Compared to other works on efficient panoptic segmentation like YOSO, MaskConver, and EfficientPS, this paper takes a different approach of improving the training process rather than the model architecture.- The proposed techniques are simple but effective. They do not introduce any overhead during inference. This makes the method easy to implement and integrate into existing frameworks.- The paper includes comprehensive experiments and visualizations to analyze the impact of the proposed relaxation techniques. The gains are shown to be consistent across datasets and backbones.- The work builds upon state-of-the-art mask transformers like kMaX-DeepLab and Mask2Former. So it demonstrates the broader applicability of the ideas beyond one specific mask transformer model.In summary, this paper makes an important contribution in improving training for panoptic segmentation, especially for efficient models. The relaxation techniques are simple, novel and complementary to existing work on model architecture modifications or training tricks. The consistent gains across settings are promising.
