# [ReMaX: Relaxing for Better Training on Efficient Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17319)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we improve the training of mask transformers for efficient panoptic segmentation?More specifically, the authors aim to address the issue that the training objective of panoptic segmentation leads to highly unbalanced losses, making it difficult to train mask transformer models, especially efficient architectures. Their central hypothesis is that adding relaxation to the mask and class predictions during training can help stabilize and accelerate training for panoptic segmentation with mask transformers.The two key ways they propose to add relaxation are:1) Relaxation on Masks (ReMask): Using an auxiliary semantic segmentation branch during training to calibrate the panoptic mask predictions and reduce false positives.2) Relaxation on Classes (ReClass): Softening the one-hot class labels by weighting them based on predicted mask overlaps with ground truth masks.Through these relaxation techniques, the authors aim to improve training stability, speed, and performance for efficient mask transformers on panoptic segmentation tasks. Evaluating the impact of these proposed relaxation methods is the central focus of this paper.
