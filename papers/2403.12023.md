# [Aligning Learning with Communication in Shared Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12023)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Shared autonomy systems allow humans to collaborate with robots by providing high-level inputs, while the robot handles low-level motion control and automation.
- Prior shared autonomy systems focus on either (i) learning to infer the human's intent and provide assistance, or (ii) communicating the robot's internal state back to the operator. 
- This paper hypothesizes that humans will interact differently with shared autonomy systems when the robot communicates what it has learned, compared to settings without communication.

Proposed Solution:
- Conduct user studies to measure how robot communication affects human inputs during shared autonomy.
- Develop a modified learning algorithm for shared autonomy that accounts for the changes in human behavior caused by communication. 
- Combine communication and learning within a unified shared autonomy framework.

User Studies:
- Online and in-person studies showed humans provide fewer inputs when robot communicates its belief over goals.
- Suggests humans are more likely to release control when robot is correct, intervene when incorrect.
- Additional in-person study compared proposed approach against baselines.

Modified Learning Algorithm:
- Updates model of human's cost function based on effect of communication.  
- If robot's belief is correct, human minimizes effort. If incorrect, human provides more inputs.
- Robot's actions optimize this updated cost function.

Contributions:
- Showed via user studies that communication changes how humans interact during shared autonomy.
- Developed method to align robot learning with effects of communication.  
- Demonstrated that combining learning and communication improves subjective and objective performance.

In summary, the key insight is that communication fundamentally alters human behavior in assistive settings. By recognizing these changes, robots can better infer human intent and provide more seamless assistance.
