# [Perceptive self-supervised learning network for noisy image watermark   removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing image watermark removal methods rely on supervised learning which requires clean reference images that are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. 
- Collected images often contain noise which makes watermark removal more challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- A perceptive self-supervised learning network (PSLNet) for removing watermarks from noisy images.

- Uses a parallel network with two sub-networks:
   - Upper network: Removes noise and watermarks sequentially using task decomposition
   - Lower network: Simultaneously removes noise and watermarks using degradation model

- Obtains self-supervised image pairs (watermarked image and reference watermark image with same noise distribution) without need for clean references.

- Enhances clarity via:
   - Interactions between sub-networks to improve structural information
   - Fusing outputs of sub-networks for pixel enhancement 

- Uses a mixed perceptual loss to incorporate texture information.

Main Contributions:

- First self-supervised method for non-reference image watermark removal
- Novel network design combining task decomposition and degradation model ideas
- Interaction and fusion of sub-networks to enhance visual quality
- Mixed perceptual loss to improve texture information

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing watermarks from noisy images with blind noise levels and transparency. Demonstrates effectiveness over existing methods.

In summary, the key novelty is a self-supervised network design that can effectively remove watermarks from real-world noisy images without requiring clean reference images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a perceptive self-supervised learning network (PSLNet) using a parallel architecture to effectively remove noise and watermarks from images in a self-supervised manner without requiring reference clean images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

1) A self-supervised method is proposed to address image watermark removal without requiring reference images, which are typically difficult to obtain in practice. 

2) The proposed PSLNet method uses both task decomposition and degradation model ideas for removing watermarks in noisy images. It utilizes a parallel network architecture with an upper network for sequential noise and watermark removal, and a lower network for simultaneous removal.

3) Interactions between the upper and lower networks, along with image fusion, are used to enhance the structural information and clarity of the obtained clean images. This helps improve the visual effects for noisy image watermark removal.  

4) A mixed loss incorporating both structural and texture information, implemented using a perceptual network, is proposed. This helps achieve a more robust model for noisy image watermark removal.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of the PSLNet architecture and associated techniques to effectively address the problem of noisy image watermark removal without access to reference images, through the use of self-supervision and enhanced structural/texture information. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.
