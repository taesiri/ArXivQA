# [Perceptive self-supervised learning network for noisy image watermark   removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02211)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing image watermark removal methods rely on supervised learning which requires clean reference images that are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. 
- Collected images often contain noise which makes watermark removal more challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- A perceptive self-supervised learning network (PSLNet) for removing watermarks from noisy images.

- Uses a parallel network with two sub-networks:
   - Upper network: Removes noise and watermarks sequentially using task decomposition
   - Lower network: Simultaneously removes noise and watermarks using degradation model

- Obtains self-supervised image pairs (watermarked image and reference watermark image with same noise distribution) without need for clean references.

- Enhances clarity via:
   - Interactions between sub-networks to improve structural information
   - Fusing outputs of sub-networks for pixel enhancement 

- Uses a mixed perceptual loss to incorporate texture information.

Main Contributions:

- First self-supervised method for non-reference image watermark removal
- Novel network design combining task decomposition and degradation model ideas
- Interaction and fusion of sub-networks to enhance visual quality
- Mixed perceptual loss to improve texture information

- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing watermarks from noisy images with blind noise levels and transparency. Demonstrates effectiveness over existing methods.

In summary, the key novelty is a self-supervised network design that can effectively remove watermarks from real-world noisy images without requiring clean reference images.
