# [Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) inevitably exhibit hallucinations and factual errors due to the inability to secure accuracy solely from their parametric knowledge. 
- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved documents. If retrieval fails, RAG can expose LLMs to inaccurate knowledge, exacerbating hallucinations and errors.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), which improves the robustness and self-correction ability of RAG systems.

- A lightweight retrieval evaluator assesses relevance of retrieved documents and quantifies a confidence degree. Based on this, three knowledge retrieval actions are triggered:
  - Correct: Refine retrieved documents into precise key information.
  - Incorrect: Discard retrieved documents. Conduct web search for new complementary knowledge.  
  - Ambiguous: Combine refined retrieved documents and web knowledge.

- Additional operations like search query rewriting and external knowledge selection filter out irrelevant information from web search results.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes first corrective strategies to improve robustness of RAG systems against inaccurate retrieved documents.
- Designs CRAG method with retrieval evaluator and triggered actions for self-correction.
- Integrates web search to harness expansive nature of web and complement initial retrieved documents.
- Experiments couple CRAG with RAG methods and demonstrate significant gains across various datasets and generation tasks.
- Shows CRAG's adaptability to RAG methods and generalizability across short and long form generation.

In summary, the paper tackles inaccurate knowledge retrieval in RAG systems via targeted corrective mechanisms and web augmentation. This enhances robustness and self-correction abilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), a plug-and-play method to improve the robustness of retrieval-augmented generation by evaluating retrieval quality, triggering corrective actions like web search, and refining retrieved knowledge.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1) This paper studies the scenarios where the retriever returns inaccurate results and makes the first attempt to design corrective strategies for RAG to improve its robustness.

2) A plug-and-play method named CRAG (Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation) is proposed to improve the ability of automatic self-correction and efficient utilization of retrieved documents. 

3) Experimental results extensively demonstrate CRAG's adaptability to RAG-based approaches and its generalizability across short- and long-form generation tasks.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a method called CRAG that can correct inaccurate retrieval results and improve the robustness of retrieval-augmented generation systems. It does this through techniques like a retrieval evaluator, web search augmentation, and optimized knowledge utilization. Experiments show CRAG can significantly boost the performance of existing RAG methods across different text generation tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the retrieval evaluator quantitatively estimate the relevance of retrieved documents to determine a confidence score and trigger different actions? What metrics or techniques are used?

2. The paper mentions utilizing web searches when incorrect documents are retrieved. What strategies are used to formulate effective search queries? How is the expansive nature of the web harnessed?  

3. The decompose-then-recompose algorithm for refining retrieved documents is a key contribution. Can you elaborate on how this algorithm works to filter out irrelevant information at a granular level?

4. How does Corrective RAG determine the level of granularity when decomposing retrieved documents into knowledge strips? What heuristic rules are used?

5. One strength claimed is generalizability across tasks. How does the method adapt for short-form vs long-form generation tasks? What modifications are made?

6. How does the method specifically handle scenarios where no reliable retrieved documents are available as knowledge sources? What backup strategies are in place?

7. The flexibility to replace the underlying language model is noted. What architectural considerations enable seamless switching of the generator component? 

8. How are the upper and lower confidence thresholds determined for triggering the three actions? What metrics guide this decision-making?

9. For the "ambiguous" action, what strategies optimize combining the internal and external knowledge sources into a unified representation?

10. Self-CRAG is proposed by integrating into Self-RAG. What modifications were required for this integration? How do the two methods synergize?
