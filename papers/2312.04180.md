# [AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online   Labor Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04180)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper develops a conceptual framework and empirical analysis to understand the evolving relation between artificial intelligence (AI) and jobs. It proposes that AI performance for any task depends on four factors: task learnability, statistical resources, computation resources, and learning techniques. By visualizing occupations as sets of tasks and comparing the current AI performance to the level required to substitute humans, the paper argues there are three phases in the AI-jobs relation: decoupled, honeymoon, and substitution. It then conjectures the existence of an inflection point for each occupation after which further AI progress negatively affects workers. Empirically analyzing the launch of ChatGPT's impact on translation and web development jobs on an online labor platform, the paper finds results consistent with translation jobs having passed the inflection point but not web development jobs. More studies examining the AI-jobs relation for diverse occupations are called for to understand automation's employment impacts.
