## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a Q-learning reinforcement learning approach to solve the continuous control problem of robot inverted pendulum balancing. The control policy is trained in simulation using an accurate mathematical model derived from real system data. The model parameters are estimated by fitting a curve to the damped oscillatory motion of the free pendulum. The trained policy is then transferred to the real robotic system for evaluation. The approach demonstrates feasibility in balancing the inverted pendulum on the physical robot for a period of time, although it eventually fails due to unmodeled dynamics. The use of simulation provides multiple advantages such as faster training, reduced hardware damage risk, and flexibility to start from various initial conditions. While a discrete action space Q-learning method suffices to control this continuous system, future work involves improving robustness by incorporating more real world data. Overall, this study shows promise in using tabular Q-learning for continuous robot control problems given an accurate dynamical model.
