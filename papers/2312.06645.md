# [Beyond Classification: Definition and Density-based Estimation of   Calibration in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06645)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper tackles the challenge of defining and estimating calibration error specifically for object detection tasks. The authors propose a general framework that unifies existing definitions of calibration in object detection by introducing a similarity measure and link function to flexibly parameterize the notion of a "correct" detection. They then derive a consistent and differentiable estimator of the calibration error based on kernel density estimation, which can assess the calibration of common detectors like Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet and FCOS. Through extensive experiments on COCO, Cityscapes and Pascal VOC datasets, they demonstrate their estimator's effectiveness against competing methods, and show it can be integrated as an auxiliary loss during training to reduce calibration error while maintaining detection performance. Key results include: formulating a principled definition of calibration error tailored to object detection's structured output space; devising the first consistent, differentiable estimator of calibration error for this task; and presenting a calibration-regularized training approach that finetunes off-the-shelf detectors to improve calibration, without sacrificing average precision or requiring full retraining. The proposed mathematical framework enables both reliable evaluation and mitigation of miscalibration for object detectors deployed in safety-critical applications.
