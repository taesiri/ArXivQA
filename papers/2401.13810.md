# [Automated Root Causing of Cloud Incidents using In-Context Learning with   GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13810)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Root cause analysis (RCA) is critical for identifying underlying issues in cloud service incidents to prevent recurrences and reduce downtime. However, the process relies heavily on manual effort.
- Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show promise for automating RCA, but fine-tuning them requires substantial GPU resources and continuous updating as new data emerges.

Proposed Solution:  
- An in-context learning approach to equip vanilla GPT models with incident domain knowledge without fine-tuning, using historical incidents as examples in the model input.

Key Contributions:
- First study showcasing feasibility of using vanilla GPT models like GPT-4 for accurate RCA through in-context learning.
- Extensive experiments on 100K+ production incidents demonstrate 24.8% average improvement over fine-tuned GPT-3 and 49.7% over zero-shot GPT-4.
- Human evaluation with incident owners reveals 43.5% better correctness and 8.7% improvement in readability over fine-tuned model.
- Avoid high costs of fine-tuning huge datasets while achieving even better performance than fine-tuned models.

In summary, this paper introduces an innovative in-context learning method to empower vanilla large language models for automated root cause analysis without model fine-tuning. Rigorous experiments and human validation demonstrate clear improvements in effectiveness and practicality over existing fine-tuned models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using incident summarization before building the retrieval index. What is the rationale behind summarizing incidents before indexing and how does it help with retrieval performance?

2. The paper compares in-context learning with a traditional retrieval augmentation approach using chunked incidents. What are the key differences between these two approaches and why does in-context learning perform better? 

3. The paper experiments with different orders for arranging the in-context examples - descending relevance, ascending relevance and randomized. Why does order seem to have minimal impact on performance?

4. When varying the number of in-context examples, performance peaks at 20 examples then declines. What causes this decline in performance with more examples? How can this issue be addressed?

5. For the human evaluation, why does linking incidents to other responsible incidents negatively impact performance? How can the approach account for dependencies between linked incidents?

6. When comparing semantic vs lexical metrics, why is the relative improvement lower for semantic metrics when using in-context learning? How can semantic performance be further improved?

7. The paper mentions the approach relies on coherence of root causes between similar incidents. How can the approach be adapted for completely new incidents without similar prior examples? 

8. How feasible would it be to continuously update the retrieval index and in-context examples to account for emerging and outdated knowledge? What challenges exist?

9. The paper focuses on production incidents - could the approach be applied to test failures or developer submitted issues? Would any adaptations be required?

10. How do the computational requirements of this in-context learning approach compare to fine-tuning large language models? What are the practical benefits?
