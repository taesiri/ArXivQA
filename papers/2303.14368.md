# [FlexNeRF: Photorealistic Free-viewpoint Rendering of Moving Humans from   Sparse Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14368)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we achieve photorealistic free-viewpoint rendering of moving humans from monocular videos, especially in cases where only sparse views are available? 

The key hypothesis seems to be:

By jointly learning a pose-dependent motion field and a complementary pose-independent temporal deformation within a neural radiance field (NeRF) framework, and applying novel consistency constraints and losses, it is possible to address the challenges of free-viewpoint rendering from sparse monocular video.

Specifically, the paper proposes:

- A novel approach to jointly optimize a canonical pose along with complementary pose-dependent and pose-independent deformations to map input frames to the canonical space.

- Using a cyclic consistency loss to regularize the learned deformations by mapping between canonical and observed spaces.

- A temporal consistency loss to leverage contextual information from neighboring frames.

- Additional losses on intermediate outputs like segmentation masks.

The central goal is to show this approach can achieve high quality free-viewpoint rendering from sparse monocular video of complex human motions, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, especially as the number of input views becomes smaller.

In summary, the key research question is how to achieve high quality free-viewpoint rendering from sparse monocular video of humans. The central hypothesis is that jointly learning pose-dependent and pose-independent deformations along with novel consistency losses can address this challenging problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- It proposes FlexNeRF, a novel method for photorealistic free-viewpoint rendering of moving humans from monocular videos. 

- It proposes to jointly optimize a canonical pose configuration, with a pose-dependent motion field and a pose-independent temporal deformation complementing each other.

- It introduces a novel cyclic consistency loss and temporal consistency loss to regularize the estimated deformation fields. 

- It adds additional losses on intermediate representations like segmentation masks to further improve training.

- It shows experimentally that FlexNeRF significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, especially when the input views are sparse.

In summary, the key novelty is the joint optimization framework combining pose-dependent and pose-independent deformations for modeling humans, along with novel regularization losses. This allows high quality free-viewpoint rendering from sparse input views of complex human motions.
