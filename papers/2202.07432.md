# [A precortical module for robust CNNs to light variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07432)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can a simple mathematical model of the low visual pathway in mammals be used to improve the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, specifically with regards to variations in global light intensity and contrast?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) A simplified mathematical model of the visual pathway, focusing on the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and primary visual cortex (V1), can capture the key components relevant for modeling issues like light/contrast adaptation. 2) The structure of CNNs for image classification mirrors the cortical portion of the visual pathway, but does not fully take into account the precortical structures (retina, LGN) responsible for adapting to light/contrast changes.3) Adding a "precortical" module, inspired by the mathematical modeling of retina/LGN, to a CNN architecture will improve robustness to variations in light and contrast not seen during training.The paper aims to develop the simplified mathematical model, demonstrate the parallels to CNN structure, introduce a sample precortical module, and validate through experiments on image datasets that this module improves CNN robustness as hypothesized.
