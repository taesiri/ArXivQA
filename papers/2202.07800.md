# [Not All Patches are What You Need: Expediting Vision Transformers via   Token Reorganizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07800)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to accelerate Vision Transformer (ViT) models by reducing redundant computations on less informative image patches/tokens. 

The key hypothesis is that not all image patches contribute equally to the ViT's predictions - some contain semantically meaningless backgrounds while others contain more useful visual content. Hence, the paper proposes a method to identify and fuse less informative patches during training, reducing computations for multi-headed self-attention and feedforward layers while preserving accuracy.

In summary, the main research question is how to expedite ViT models by reorganizing image patches/tokens, and the hypothesis is that fusing less informative patches identified by patch-token attention can maintain accuracy while decreasing computational costs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a token reorganization method to identify and fuse image tokens in Vision Transformers (ViTs). The method identifies attentive image tokens that are important for predictions and fuses inattentive tokens to reduce computations in ViTs. 

2. Incorporating this token reorganization into the training procedure of ViTs. This allows ViTs to be trained to focus on attentive tokens and reduces redundant computations.

3. Demonstrating two benefits of the proposed method:

(a) Reducing computation cost of inference for ViTs by fusing inattentive tokens, while maintaining accuracy. For example, inference speed of DeiT-S is increased by 50% with only 0.3% drop in ImageNet accuracy.

(b) Enabling ViTs to take in more image tokens from higher resolution images at the same computational cost. This improves accuracy since more informative tokens are processed. For instance, DeiT-S accuracy is improved by 1% on ImageNet with no increase in computations.

4. Introducing an inattentive token fusion method to fuse information from non-attentive tokens into a new token, instead of completely discarding them. This further improves performance.

5. Showing consistent improvements on computational efficiency and/or accuracy on ImageNet classification using DeiT and LV-ViT models. The proposed method does not introduce extra parameters.

In summary, the core contribution is a way to reorganize and reduce image tokens in ViTs to improve efficiency and/or accuracy, with experimental validation on standard benchmarks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method to reorganize image tokens in Vision Transformers by identifying and preserving the most attentive tokens while fusing less informative tokens, which speeds up inference and allows handling more input tokens under the same computational budget.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on Vision Transformers:

- It focuses specifically on accelerating Vision Transformers through token reorganization, which is a novel approach compared to other work on speeding up ViTs that has looked more at architectural modifications or inference-time optimization. 

- The method dynamically selects a subset of image tokens during training based on their attentiveness, rather than using a static or predefined selection. This allows the model to learn which tokens are most important.

- It incorporates the token reorganization directly into ViT model training, rather than requiring a separate pre-trained model like some prior work. This results in an end-to-end trainable approach.

- The proposed EViT method is compatible with different ViT architectures like DeiT and LV-ViT. It accelerates them without changing the core Transformer structure. Other research has introduced new ViT variants with different designs.

- It shows acceleration results on large-scale image classification as the main task. Some related work focused more on smaller datasets or transfer learning scenarios.

- The experiments demonstrate EViT can provide a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Many other ViT methods aim to improve accuracy but may increase computational cost.

Overall, this paper introduces a novel way to speed up Vision Transformers by selectively reducing tokens, validated through extensive experiments. The approach is complementary to other innovations in ViT architecture and training.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring different strategies for identifying the most "attentive" tokens to keep, beyond just using the attention from the [CLS] token. The authors suggest the tokens-to-tokens attention could be one possibility.

- Investigating more efficient ways to obtain high-quality attention masks to guide the token selection, perhaps using ideas from self-supervised pre-training like DINO. The quality of the masks correlates with model performance.

- Adapting the proposed token reorganization method to other Vision Transformer architectures, especially ones without a [CLS] token like PVT. The approach is general and could likely be applied in other ViT models. 

- Training ViT models with the proposed EViT method on larger datasets and for more epochs to further close the gap with regular ViTs. The efficiency gains allow training EViT models for longer.

- Applying the token selection idea to other modalities like text or audio, where attention is also key. The overall idea of selective computation based on attention could transfer.

- Exploring dynamic token reorganization during inference, adapting the computations based on each input, rather than just using a fixed strategy.

- Combining the proposed approach with other ViT efficiency methods like model distillation or quantization to push efficiency even further.

So in summary, the authors highlight improving token selection, generalizing across architectures, training for longer, transferring to other modalities, and combining techniques as interesting future directions stemming from this work. The overall idea of using attention to guide selective computation in Transformers has a lot of promise.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called EViT to accelerate Vision Transformer (ViT) models by reorganizing image tokens during training. The key idea is to identify "attentive" tokens that contribute most to the model's predictions, while fusing "inattentive" tokens that are less important. Specifically, the attentiveness of each token is determined by its attention score from the class token. The top-k attentive tokens are preserved, while the other inattentive tokens are fused into one token to reduce computation in the self-attention and feedforward layers. Experiments on ImageNet classification show EViT can speed up inference of DeiT-S by 50% with only a 0.3% drop in accuracy. EViT also allows training with more image tokens from higher resolution images, improving DeiT-S accuracy by 1% with the same computation cost. The method is shown to work well on ViT variants like LV-ViT too. Overall, EViT reaches a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off by reorganizing image tokens based on their attentiveness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called EViT to accelerate Vision Transformer (ViT) models for image classification. The key idea is to reorganize the image tokens that are fed into the ViT model by identifying and preserving only the most attentive tokens while fusing the inattentive ones. 

Specifically, EViT uses the attention values from the class token to the image tokens to determine the attentiveness or importance of each image token. The top-k most attentive tokens are preserved while the remaining inattentive tokens are fused into a single token. This token reorganization is performed between the self-attention and feedforward layers of the ViT encoder. By reducing the number of tokens, EViT speeds up the subsequent self-attention and feedforward computations in the ViT model. Experiments show EViT can accelerate inference of ViT models like DeiT by 50-85% with minimal loss in accuracy (e.g. only 0.3% drop for DeiT-S on ImageNet). Additionally, when trained on higher resolution images, EViT improves accuracy of ViTs like DeiT-S by 1% under the same computational budget. Overall, EViT provides an effective way to expedite ViT models by reorganizing image tokens based on their attentiveness.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a token reorganization method called EViT to expedite Vision Transformers (ViTs). EViT works by identifying the most "attentive" image tokens in each ViT encoder layer based on their attention values from the class token. The attentive tokens are kept while the inattentive ones are fused into a single token, thereby reducing the number of tokens fed into subsequent Transformer layers. This reduces the computational cost of multi-head self-attention and feedforward network modules in ViT encoders. EViT incorporates this token reorganization into ViT training, allowing it to learn which tokens are more informative. It gradually reduces tokens as the network goes deeper, focusing computations on more discriminative patches while preserving semantics. EViT improves efficiency without changing the ViT architecture or introducing new parameters. It can speed up inference at fixed computation budgets, or improve accuracy if given more tokens from higher resolution images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper aims to accelerate Vision Transformer (ViT) models for visual recognition tasks like image classification. The key ideas and contributions are:

- Observing that not all image patches (tokens) contribute equally to the final prediction in ViT models. Some tokens like background patches may be less informative.

- Proposing a token reorganization method to identify and fuse less informative (inattentive) tokens during ViT's feedforward pass, which reduces the computation cost of subsequent self-attention and feedforward layers.

- The identification of inattentive tokens is guided by the attention scores between image tokens and the class token. The inattentive tokens are fused into a single token to preserve some information.

- The proposed method called EViT improves efficiency of ViT models from two aspects: (1) Under the same amount of input tokens, EViT reduces computation cost of ViT for faster inference while maintaining accuracy; (2) Under the same computation budget, EViT takes more tokens as input (from higher-res images) for better accuracy.

- EViT is evaluated on ImageNet classification using DeiT and LV-ViT backbones. Results show it can accelerate inference by 50% with minimal accuracy drop, or improve accuracy with no additional computation cost.

In summary, the key idea is to identify and remove/fuse non-informative tokens in ViT models to improve efficiency, using a token reorganization technique guided by self-attention. The paper focuses on adapting ViT models for better speed-accuracy trade-offs.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called EViT to expedite Vision Transformers (ViTs) by identifying and reorganizing image tokens during the feedforward process. The key idea is that not all image patches contribute equally to the ViT prediction, so some less informative patches can be discarded to reduce computation. Specifically, EViT computes the attention between the class token and image tokens to determine the importance of each image token. The top-k most attentive image tokens are preserved while the rest are fused into one token. In this way, EViT reduces the number of tokens fed into the subsequent ViT layers, decreasing the computation cost of multi-head self-attention and feedforward networks. Experiments on ImageNet classification using DeiT and LV-ViT backbones show EViT can achieve significant speedup (e.g. 50% for DeiT-S) with minimal accuracy drop (e.g. 0.3% for DeiT-S). EViT also enables training with more image tokens from higher resolution images, improving accuracy by 1% for DeiT-S without increasing computation. Overall, the proposed token reorganization method provides an effective way to accelerate ViT models by reducing redundant computation on less informative image tokens.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called EViT to expedite Vision Transformers (ViTs) by reorganizing image tokens during model training. The key idea is to identify and preserve the most attentive tokens that contribute positively to model predictions while fusing insignificant tokens to reduce computation. Specifically, the attentiveness of each token is measured by its attention score with the class token in the self-attention mechanism. The most attentive tokens are kept and the rest are fused into one token before feeding into the next Transformer block. This token reorganization allows reducing the amount of computation in multi-head self-attention and feedforward networks while maintaining model accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet classification show EViT can accelerate inference of ViTs like DeiT and LV-ViT by 50-70% with minimal accuracy drop. It also enables training ViTs on higher resolution images to improve accuracy without increasing computation cost. The proposed token reorganization brings no extra parameters and can be easily integrated into various ViT models.
