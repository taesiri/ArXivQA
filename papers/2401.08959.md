# [Towards Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for Ranking Policies with   Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08959)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional probabilistic learning to rank (LTR) models for recommender systems optimize for immediate rewards based on logged feedback but cannot maximize long-term user rewards. 
- Reinforcement learning (RL) methods can maximize long-term rewards but suffer from lack of online interactions, difficulty in learning ranking policies, and issues with sparse/partial feedback.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel off-policy value ranking (VR) algorithm based on an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that unifies probabilistic LTR and RL to address the limitations of both. 
- The framework includes an M-step that trains a policy network using knowledge transferred from a reward regression network trained in the E-step. This allows learning from sparse/partial rewards.
- For sequential recommendation, the algorithm estimates a posterior policy that relative ranks state-action values instead of estimating absolute values. This avoids overestimation and is more suited to ranking.  

Main Contributions:
- An EM framework that unifies probability LTR and RL, enabling learning from both ranking feedback and rewards.
- Techniques to address challenges of sparse/partial rewards and lack of negative feedback.
- An off-policy VR method that can maximize long-term rewards for sequential recommendation without online interactions.
- Theoretical analysis showing VR reduces overestimation bias and variance compared to Q-learning. 
- Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrating state-of-the-art performance of VR with improved accuracy, effectiveness in multi-objective optimization, and robustness across datasets and models.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel approach to integrate the strengths of LTR and RL that can optimize both immediate and long-term rewards for recommender systems in an off-policy manner. Both theoretically and empirically it addresses key challenges faced by existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm based on an Expectation-Maximization framework that can simultaneously maximize long-term rewards and optimize the ranking metric for sequential recommendation without requiring online interactions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes an EM framework that can learn from sparse and partial reward signals by unifying probability and reinforcement ranking principles. 

2) It extends the EM framework to sequential settings and proposes an off-policy value ranking (VR) algorithm that can maximize long-term rewards without online interactions while achieving good ranking performance.

3) It provides theoretical analysis showing that the proposed VR algorithm can reduce overestimation bias and estimation variance compared to standard Q-learning. 

4) It conducts extensive experiments on two real-world datasets with three state-of-the-art recommendation backbones, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving ranking performance over strong baselines.

5) It performs simulated online experiments in the RecSim environment which further validate that the proposed VR algorithm can learn good policies without actual online interactions.

In summary, the main contribution is an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm for ranking that can effectively learn from logged bandit feedback to maximize long-term rewards while optimizing ranking metrics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework effectively unify probability learning to rank (LTR) and reinforcement learning (RL) for recommendation? What is the intuition behind formulating a generative model with binary optimality variables?

2) Explain the key challenges in applying EM to learn from partial/sparse rewards and lack of negative signals in recommendations. How does the paper address these challenges through reward extrapolation and ranking regularization?

3) What is the key insight behind modeling state transitions in the sequential recommendation setting? How does the proposed off-policy value ranking (VR) algorithm approximate the posterior for action selection?

4) Discuss how VR optimizes for the ranking metric by learning relative value functions instead of absolute state-action values. How does this differentiate from standard Q-learning? 

5) Analyze theoretically how VR helps in reducing overestimation bias compared to Q-learning methods. Also discuss how the M-step bounds variance from importance sampling.

6) Critically evaluate the multi-objective optimization experiments. Does assigning different rewards lead to improved overall performance? How does VR balance tradeoffs?

7) What role does the discount factor play in weighting current and future rewards? How sensitive is overall performance to this factor? 

8) How do the distillation parameters α and β control knowledge transfer between teacher and student policies in VR? What trends do you observe by varying them?

9) Compare offline and online experimental results. Why does DQN perform poorly online? How can VR effectively adapt to distribution shifts?

10) Discuss limitations of the current approach and open problems that still need to be addressed in learning recommender systems without user interaction data.
