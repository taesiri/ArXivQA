# [Using Large Language Models for Student-Code Guided Test Case Generation   in Computer Science Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07081)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- In computer science education, test cases play an important role in assessing students' programming knowledge and providing personalized feedback. However, manually constructing test cases is labor-intensive and requires expert knowledge.  
- Existing works on automated test case generation focus on software testing, not on measuring student knowledge in educational settings. Generating test cases for students, especially novice programmers, is significantly different than for professional developers.
- Therefore, there is a need for an automated process to generate test cases as assessments and provide feedback tailored for students.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a large language model (LLM)-based approach to automatically generate test cases guided by representative student code samples.
- Their iterative refinement method selects a pair of buggy and correct student codes to prompt the LLM to generate test cases. The LLM generates test cases such that the correct code passes all test cases, while the buggy code passes only a subset based on its score.
- A code compiler executes the codes against the generated test cases to provide feedback to the LLM to refine the test cases. This feedback loop helps improve the quality of test cases.

Contributions:
- A fully automated LLM and compiler-based approach for student code-guided test case generation.
- Evaluation on a real-world student coding dataset showing their method can generate test cases that accurately reflect student performance.
- Released test cases for 50 programming problems to enable future educational data mining research leveraging test cases.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel automated technique using LLMs to generate programming assignment test cases tailored toward assessing students' knowledge and provides empirical evidence showing its promise.
