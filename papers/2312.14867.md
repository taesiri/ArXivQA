# [VIEScore: Towards Explainable Metrics for Conditional Image Synthesis   Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14867)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating conditional image generation models remains challenging due to limited metrics that align with human judgment. Existing metrics lack task awareness, explainability, and the ability to properly assess the desired aspects of synthetic images. Overreliance on human evaluation also faces issues like scalability and subjectivity.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes VIEScore, a Visual Instruction-guided Explainable metric that leverages large language models (LLMs) to evaluate conditional image synthesis tasks.

- VIEScore takes an instruction, image, and conditions as input. It then outputs a score and rationale explaining the judgment, enabling interpretability.

- GPT-4v is used as the backbone, requiring no training or fine-tuning. Custom rating instructions are created for different tasks to provide comprehensive assessment.  

Main Contributions:
- VIEScore achieves high correlation (0.3) with human ratings across 7 conditional image tasks, approaching inter-human correlation (0.45).

- GPT-4v significantly outperforms other open-source LLMs in assessing synthetic images, showing its potential as an automatic evaluator.

- VIEScore matches human correlation on generation tasks but struggles more on editing tasks, highlighting challenges in detecting minor image edits.

- Compared to metrics like CLIP Score and LPIPS, GPT-4v better aligns with human perspectives and model rankings, demonstrating capabilities beyond existing automatic methods.

- The paper provides insights on limitations of current LLMs in image evaluation and future directions to match human-level performance.

In summary, the paper introduces a promising framework towards explainable and automatic evaluation of conditional image synthesis that approaches human-level judgment.
