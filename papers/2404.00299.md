# [HOI-M3:Capture Multiple Humans and Objects Interaction within Contextual   Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Most current methods for modeling human-object interactions (HOI) focus on isolated individuals and objects, due to lack of data for multi-person multi-object scenarios. Capturing motions of multiple humans and objects is challenging due to severe occlusions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces HOI-M$^3$, a large-scale dataset with accurate 3D tracking labels for both humans and objects, covering interactions between multiple humans and multiple objects.

- The data is captured using a dome with 42 synchronized cameras plus object-mounted inertial sensors. A robust pipeline is used for segmentation, calibration, human pose estimation and inertial-aided multi-object tracking.

- The dataset contains over 199 sequences, 181M frames, covering interactions of 31 subjects with 90 objects across 5 daily life scenarios.

Main Contributions:
- HOI-M$^3$ is the first multi-person multi-object HOI dataset with accurate 3D motion capture. It features multiple humans and objects, high capture quality, large scale (20 hours, 181M frames), and multimodal data.

- The paper presents two novel tasks with baseline methods: 
   1) Monocular capture of multiple HOI using a single-shot approach to estimate poses of multiple humans and objects
   2) Unstructured generation of multiple HOI using conditional diffusion models

- Extensive experiments demonstrate HOI-M$^3$ is challenging and can facilitate future research on analyzing and modeling multi-person multi-object interactions and behaviors.

- The dataset, code and models will be released to the community to stimulate research on human-object interaction perception and generation.
