# [Goal-Conditioned Predictive Coding as an Implicit Planner for Offline   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03406)

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a two-stage framework that decouples trajectory representation learning and policy learning for offline reinforcement learning. The key points are:- They propose a two-stage framework that separates trajectory representation learning and policy learning. This provides a unified view to compare different design choices such as training objectives, architectures, etc.- They introduce a specific design called Goal-Conditioned Predictive Coding (GCPC) within this framework. GCPC introduces bottlenecks that transfer representations between the two stages. The bottlenecks are trained to perform implicit planning by predicting future states conditioned on goals. - They conduct experiments on AntMaze, FrankaKitchen and Gym Locomotion environments. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and show that:   - Sequence modeling can help decision making by learning useful trajectory representations.   - Goal-conditioned predictive coding is an effective objective for representation learning. The resulting bottlenecks serve as implicit planners to guide policy learning.   - Decoupling representation learning and policy learning is beneficial as the optimal objectives for the two stages can be different.In summary, the key contribution is proposing the two-stage framework to separately learn trajectory representations and policies, with a specific design GCPC that introduces bottlenecks for implicit planning. This is shown empirically to enable strong performance on various offline RL benchmarks.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:- It proposes a two-stage framework that decouples trajectory representation learning and policy learning. This provides a unified view to compare different design choices like training objectives, architectures, etc. for offline RL. - It investigates the impact of different sequence modeling objectives like masked autoencoding for trajectory representation learning. Most prior works focus on joint training.- It introduces goal-conditioned predictive coding (GCPC) to learn latent representations about the future that serve as an "implicit planner" to guide policy learning. This is a novel approach compared to prior methods.- It demonstrates strong empirical performance of GCPC across multiple benchmarks like AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, and Gym Locomotion environments. This shows the approach is widely applicable.- In contrast to some recent works that question the necessity of sequence modeling for offline RL, this paper provides evidence that proper sequence modeling can effectively aid decision making in certain tasks.- It decouples representation learning and policy learning, allowing mismatches between optimal objectives for the two stages. Many prior works aim for joint end-to-end training.Overall, the key novelties are the proposed framework, the GCPC approach leveraging predictive coding and implicit planning, and the insights on effective sequence modeling objectives for offline RL. The experiments validate the competitiveness and generalizability of the methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Exploring end-to-end training of the two-staged framework for trajectory representation learning and policy learning. Currently these two stages are trained separately in a pipeline. End-to-end training could potentially improve performance.- Deploying the learned latent representations in open-loop evaluation settings. The current work focuses on closed-loop evaluation of policies. Testing the utility of the representations more broadly could be interesting. - Learning temporal abstractions and hierarchical policies using the latent representations. The current work looks at flat policies, hierarchical policies could potentially handle more complex tasks.- Increasing the dataset size and number of evaluation seeds for the FrankaKitchen environment. The authors note the small dataset size may have led to high variance in results. Expanding the data and evaluation could yield more robust conclusions.- Evaluating the approach on a wider variety of tasks and environments beyond the ones studied here. Assessing generalizability is an important direction.- Mitigating the limitations around only using the latent representations as an input conditioning mechanism. Exploring other ways to leverage the representations could be beneficial.- Exploring different self-supervised objectives beyond the masking strategies studied here. Other pretext tasks may further improve the learned representations.- Studying the effects of offline dataset collection methods. The authors note performance depends on how datasets are collected. More controlled studies of this could be enlightening.In summary, the main suggested directions are around exploration of end-to-end training, hierarchical policies, broader evaluation, mitigating current limitations, and further analysis of different self-supervised objectives and dataset collection strategies.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a two-stage framework to investigate the role of sequence modeling in offline reinforcement learning. The first stage learns useful trajectory representations using masked autoencoding objectives on a transformer model. The second stage trains a simple policy network using these representations along with current states and goals. They find that predictive coding objectives like MAE-F and MAE-RC produce the best trajectory representations, as they encode implicit plans about the future. These latent plans provide crucial guidance for long-horizon tasks. They introduce a specific instantiation called Goal-Conditioned Predictive Coding (GCPC) which uses bottlenecks to transfer learned representations between stages. GCPC shows strong performance on AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, and Gym Locomotion benchmarks. The results demonstrate sequence modeling can aid decision making by learning powerful trajectory representations, especially for long-horizon sparse reward tasks. The work provides insights into preferred training objectives and architecture designs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes a two-stage framework to investigate the role of sequence modeling in offline reinforcement learning (RL). In the first stage, a sequence model called TrajNet is trained to learn useful representations from offline trajectories using objectives like masked autoencoding. In the second stage, these learned representations are used to help train a policy network called PolicyNet in a supervised manner on the offline data. By decoupling trajectory representation learning from policy learning, this framework allows exploration of different objectives and architectures for each stage. The authors introduce a specific instantiation called Goal-Conditioned Predictive Coding (GCPC) where the TrajNet compresses trajectories into bottlenecks that are conditioned on goals and encode the future. Experiments on AntMaze, FrankaKitchen, and Gym Locomotion environments show GCPC achieves strong performance, demonstrating the efficacy of learning latent future representations with TrajNet to guide policy learning in PolicyNet. Overall, the two-stage framework provides a useful paradigm for studying sequence modeling in offline RL, and shows the potential of learned trajectory representations to aid policy optimization, especially for long-horizon tasks.
