# [GeoT: Tensor Centric Library for Graph Neural Network via Efficient   Segment Reduction on GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03019)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become very popular for processing graph-structured data. However, most existing GNN systems use graph-centric designs which have limitations in leveraging advanced tensor compilers for performance. 
- Tensor-centric GNN frameworks are needed but face challenges in efficiently implementing the key "segment reduction" operation required for message passing in GNNs. Main challenges are:
    1) Supporting the diverse design space needed for variable node feature lengths
    2) Adapting heuristics to dynamic inputs
    3) Enabling format-agnostic fusion with existing frameworks

Proposed Solution - GeoT:
- The paper introduces GeoT, a tensor-centric library for accelerating GNNs via efficient segment reduction on GPUs. 

Key Contributions:

1. Customized tiling algorithms and advanced thread workload mapping for segment reduction, supporting the diverse design space needs of GNNs better.

2. A data-driven decision tree method to automatically select optimal configurations based on input, avoiding costly manual tuning while achieving comparable performance.

3) Format-agnostic support for fusing the messaging and aggregation phases in GNNs, unlike prior graph-centric GNN systems. This enables integration with tensor compilers.

Results:
- On average across benchmarks, GeoT achieves 1.80x speedup for segment reduction, 1.80x speedup for SpMM fusion operation, and 1.68x end-to-end speedup for full GNN models over strong baselines.

- The decision tree method approaches optimal tuning performance with near-zero overhead. Fusion support is seamless and outperforms mainstream sparse format approaches.

- GeoT advances the state-of-the-art in supporting tensor-centric optimizations for accelerating graph neural networks.
