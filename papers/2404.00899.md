# [TM-TREK at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Towards LLM-Based Automatic Boundary   Detection for Human-Machine Mixed Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00899)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing work on detecting machine-generated text focuses on classifying entire texts as human-written or machine-generated, but neglects mixed texts containing both types of content. 
- There is a need to identify boundaries between human-authored and machine-generated segments within mixed texts.

Proposed Solution:
- Transform the boundary detection problem into a token classification task, with labels indicating human-written or machine-generated tokens.
- Use large language models (LLMs) like Longformer, XLNet and BigBird that can capture long-range dependencies in long text sequences.
- Enhance performance via an ensemble of diverse LLMs and voting on their predictions.
- Explore additional factors like extra layers on top of LLMs, specialized loss functions and pretraining techniques.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate LLMs' capability for token-level boundary detection in mixed texts.
- Present a benchmark on the new SemEval 2024 Task 8 dataset and achieve 1st place in the competition subtask.  
- Examine multiple factors impacting boundary detection performance:
    - Extra LSTM/BiLSTM layers further improve performance.
    - Segmentation-aware loss functions like dice loss reduce error.
    - Pretraining on related tasks also boosts capabilities.
- Provide insights to advance future research on detecting boundaries in human-machine mixed texts.

In summary, this paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for identifying transitions between human and machine content in mixed texts, proposes enhancements via model ensembling and other techniques, and shares valuable findings to guide future work.
