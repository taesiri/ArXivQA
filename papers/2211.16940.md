# [DiffPose: Toward More Reliable 3D Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16940)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we develop a more reliable 3D human pose estimation method that can handle the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty in estimating 3D poses from monocular images/videos?

The key hypothesis is that formulating 3D pose estimation as a reverse diffusion process, where an indeterminate pose distribution is progressively denoised into a determinate pose distribution, can allow the model to naturally handle the uncertainty and ambiguity in 3D pose estimation.

In summary, the paper proposes a new diffusion-based framework called DiffPose to tackle the challenge of uncertainty and ambiguity in monocular 3D pose estimation. The core idea is to model 3D pose estimation as a reverse diffusion process that transforms an uncertain indeterminate pose distribution into a determinate pose distribution with low uncertainty in a step-wise manner.
