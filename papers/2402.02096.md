# [Decomposition-based and Interference Perception for Infrared and Visible   Image Fusion in Complex Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) techniques make implicit assumptions that fusion is conducted in high-quality scenes without complex environmental interferences. However, in many real-world applications like automatic driving and scene analysis, the images can be degraded by extreme weather, blur, noise, overexposure, fire etc. This poses challenges for fusion algorithms to produce optimal results. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a new IVIF framework explicitly designed to handle complex scenes with multiple interferences. The key ideas are:

1) Light transmission-aware decomposition model: Pixels in the visible image are classified based on the degree of scattering during light transmission to identify interfering pixels. This facilitates separating detail/energy information.

2) Adaptive denoising: An adaptive scheme is proposed during fusion of high-frequency components to balance noise reduction and detail preservation. Significance information fusion uses monogenic phase consistency (MPC).

3) New weighted fusion rule: A Gabor filter based approach is proposed to extract low-frequency information along different directions. Fusion weights are calculated based on variance and entropy.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to address complex scene fusion for IVIF with capability to handle adverse weather, noise, blur, overexposure and fire.

2) Novel light transmission based decomposition technique to accurately classify interfering pixels in complex scenes. 

3) Adaptive detail denoising scheme balancing noise suppression and detail retention.

4) New low-frequency fusion rule using Gabor filter responses across directions and statistical features.

5) Comprehensive experiments on complex scenes and downstream tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over existing methods.

The paper makes key contributions in making IVIF more robust to practical challenges through its specialized algorithm designed for complex scenes.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new infrared and visible image fusion method for complex scenes that can adaptively identify and process interfering pixels from sources images, enabling high-quality fusion even under extreme conditions like haze, noise, heavy rain, fire, etc.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) It proposes a novel framework for infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF), specifically engineered to handle complex and challenging scenes with interferences like haze, noise, heavy rain, fire, etc. 

2) It introduces a light transmission-aware decomposition model that can accurately classify interfering pixels within complex scenes. It also develops an adaptive denoising scheme for high-frequency components to balance noise reduction and detail preservation.

3) It intentionally degrades the source images to varying extents to emulate a wide array of intricate scenes encountered in real-world settings. Experiments show the proposed algorithm successfully fuses images under severe conditions, outperforming many current methods.

In summary, the key contribution is a new IVIF approach specialized for fusing images captured in complex real-world environments with multiple interferences, which existing techniques fail to handle effectively. The method can identify and suppress interfering information while preserving essential details.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF): The overall focus of the paper is on fusing infrared and visible images to create comprehensive fused images that take advantage of the complementary strengths of both modalities.

- Complex scenes: The paper emphasizes dealing with complex real-world scenes containing interferences like noise, blur, overexposure, fire, rain, snow, etc. This sets it apart from methods tailored only for clean images.

- Decomposition models: The paper proposes decomposition of the visible image into components like contrast layer, structure layer, high/low frequencies to help identify and process interfering pixels. 

- Transmission map: A key aspect is estimating transmission maps to quantify light scattering and absorption, allowing better separation of interfering vs non-interfering content.

- Adaptive denoising: An adaptive scheme is proposed to balance noise reduction and detail preservation in fusing high-frequency components.

- Downstream tasks: Performance is evaluated on downstream tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection, salient object detection, and depth estimation.

In summary, the key focus is on infrared-visible fusion that is robust to complex real-world conditions, enabled by transmission-based decomposition and adaptive interference processing.
