# [Decomposition-based and Interference Perception for Infrared and Visible   Image Fusion in Complex Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02096)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) techniques make implicit assumptions that fusion is conducted in high-quality scenes without complex environmental interferences. However, in many real-world applications like automatic driving and scene analysis, the images can be degraded by extreme weather, blur, noise, overexposure, fire etc. This poses challenges for fusion algorithms to produce optimal results. 

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a new IVIF framework explicitly designed to handle complex scenes with multiple interferences. The key ideas are:

1) Light transmission-aware decomposition model: Pixels in the visible image are classified based on the degree of scattering during light transmission to identify interfering pixels. This facilitates separating detail/energy information.

2) Adaptive denoising: An adaptive scheme is proposed during fusion of high-frequency components to balance noise reduction and detail preservation. Significance information fusion uses monogenic phase consistency (MPC).

3) New weighted fusion rule: A Gabor filter based approach is proposed to extract low-frequency information along different directions. Fusion weights are calculated based on variance and entropy.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to address complex scene fusion for IVIF with capability to handle adverse weather, noise, blur, overexposure and fire.

2) Novel light transmission based decomposition technique to accurately classify interfering pixels in complex scenes. 

3) Adaptive detail denoising scheme balancing noise suppression and detail retention.

4) New low-frequency fusion rule using Gabor filter responses across directions and statistical features.

5) Comprehensive experiments on complex scenes and downstream tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over existing methods.

The paper makes key contributions in making IVIF more robust to practical challenges through its specialized algorithm designed for complex scenes.
