# [Detecting Everything in the Open World: Towards Universal Object   Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11749)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to develop a universal object detection model that can generalize to detect novel objects and categories without needing to be retrained. 

The key points are:

- Traditional object detectors rely on human annotations and training on closed datasets, limiting their ability to generalize to novel objects in the open world. 

- The authors propose UniDetector, a framework to train a detector that can utilize images from heterogeneous sources and label spaces, and generalize to detect novel categories not seen during training.

- UniDetector aligns visual and language spaces through image-text pretraining to provide sufficient information for learning universal representations. 

- It uses a partitioned structure to train on images from different datasets with different label spaces.

- It decouples the training of the proposal generation and classification stages to better leverage their distinct properties.

- It uses a class-agnostic localization network (CLN) to produce generalized region proposals. 

- It calibrates the predicted probabilities to reduce bias towards seen categories.

- Experiments show UniDetector can detect over 7k categories, the largest number measured. It outperforms supervised methods on novel classes without seeing any images.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that by utilizing diverse training sources and aligning vision and language spaces, the model can generalize to detect novel objects in the open world without needing to be retrained. The proposed techniques enable training and inference for universal object detection.
