# [AgentBoard: An Analytical Evaluation Board of Multi-turn LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13178)

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces AgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark and open-source evaluation framework for analytically evaluating large language model agents across diverse tasks and environments. It features progress rate metrics to capture incremental advancements, an analytical toolkit to deeply understand model capabilities, and an interactive web panel for visualization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing AgentBoard, a benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored for the analytical evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents. Specifically, AgentBoard provides:

1) A diverse set of 9 tasks across 1013 environments covering areas like embodied AI, games, web, and tools to evaluate LLM agents. The environments are carefully designed to be multi-round and partially observable. 

2) A fine-grained progress rate metric to capture incremental advancements of agents on tasks instead of just relying on final success rates.

3) An analytical evaluation toolkit and dashboard that enables assessing agent performance across dimensions like grounding accuracy, performance on hard vs easy examples, long-range interactions, sub-skill analysis, etc through interactive visualizations.

In summary, AgentBoard advances the evaluation of LLM agents through its systematic benchmark spanning diverse tasks and environments as well as its comprehensive analytical evaluation framework to gain deeper insights into agent abilities. The goal is to facilitate interpretability and further progress in developing LLM agents.

The paper introduces AgentBoard, a benchmark and analytical evaluation framework for assessing large language models as generalist agents. It emphasizes multi-turn interactions in partially observable environments across diverse tasks, and proposes a progress rate metric to capture finer-grained performance. The framework also enables analytical evaluation through interactive visualization to gain deeper insights into model capabilities. The tasks span embodied AI, games, web, and tools. Overall, the key focus is on analytical assessment of LLMs as agents beyond just success rate to drive progress.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I would ask about the method proposed in the paper:

1. How exactly did you define and calculate the progress rate metric? What considerations went into the design to ensure it accurately captures incremental advancements towards task completion?

2. Could you elaborate on how you adapted existing environments like BabyAI and ScienceWorld to be partially observable and involve longer, multi-turn interactions? What specific changes did you make? 

3. You mention annotating necessary subgoals for several tasks to track progress rates. What process did you follow to identify and validate these subgoals? How did you ensure the subgoals represented meaningful progress?

4. The fine-grained progress tracking seems highly valuable. In tasks where defining explicit subgoals was difficult, were there other strategies you considered for approximating progress, like state similarity metrics? 

5. What were some key challenges faced in unifying and standardizing observations, actions, and metrics across the diversity of tasks? How did you balance customization for each environment vs. overarching consistency?

6. Could you explain more about how you implemented the sliding window approach for long interactions that exceed the context limit? How do you determine priority for the most recent vs. initial interactions?

7. You highlight enhanced error handling and feedback as a contribution for some environments. What types of invalid actions or edge cases proved challenging for agents? How do the improved responses facilitate more rational, multi-step reasoning?

8. The interactive visualization panel provides extensive analyses into model performance. What visualization capabilities got the most usage during your evaluations? What insights did they reveal that metrics alone could not capture? 

9. You find code LLMs demonstrate better performance on several tasks, suggesting benefits from their training methodology. What specific abilities do you hypothesize code incorporation improves compared to general LLMs?

10. The benchmark focuses exclusively on text-based environments currently. What considerations would be necessary to expand the framework to multimodal settings with visual, audio, etc. inputs and outputs?
