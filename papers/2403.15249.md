# [Spectral Motion Alignment for Video Motion Transfer using Diffusion   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15249)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Spectral Motion Alignment for Video Motion Transfer using Diffusion Models":

Problem:
- Existing video diffusion models can generate realistic videos from text prompts, allowing customization of motion and appearance. However, accurately distilling and transferring motion patterns remains challenging. 
- Using consecutive frame residuals as motion vectors (as in VMC) lacks global context and is vulnerable to framewise distortions.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Spectral Motion Alignment (SMA), a novel framework to refine and align motion vectors using Fourier and wavelet transforms. 

- It includes two main components:
  1) Spectral global motion alignment: Uses 1D wavelet transform on motion vectors to capture multi-scale motion dynamics and global frame transitions.
  2) Spectral local motion refinement: Uses 2D Fourier transform to align amplitude/phase spectrum of motion vectors while prioritizing low frequencies, since high frequencies may contain non-motion artifacts.

- SMA incorporates frequency-domain regularization at both global and local levels to learn comprehensive motion patterns while reducing spatial artifacts.

Main Contributions:
- Introduces a frequency-domain motion alignment framework that is orthogonal to existing pixel-domain objectives for motion distillation.
- Achieves accurate motion transfer while adding negligible computational overhead. Demonstrates wide compatibility by integrating SMA with various diffusion models.
- Extensive experiments validate SMA's ability to capture complex motions and improve state-of-the-art video customization frameworks like VMC, MotionDirector, Tune-A-Video etc. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate clear improvements.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions in motion learning for video generation models by proposing harmonic global and local frequency-domain alignment objectives within a computationally efficient framework.
