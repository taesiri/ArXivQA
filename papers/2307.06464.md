# [Assessing the Ability of ChatGPT to Screen Articles for Systematic   Reviews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06464)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Can ChatGPT be used to assist in screening articles for systematic reviews? 

More specifically, the authors investigate:

1. How consistent are the decisions made by ChatGPT in screening articles?

2. How does the classification performance of ChatGPT compare to traditional classifiers used in systematic review automation? 

3. How generalizable are the decisions made by ChatGPT across different systematic reviews?

The overall goal is to assess the viability of using ChatGPT, a large language model, to help automate the screening phase of conducting systematic literature reviews. The screening phase is typically very laborious and time-consuming, so automating it with AI could provide major efficiency gains. The authors test ChatGPT's performance in making screening decisions compared to other machine learning classifiers and across multiple systematic review datasets.

In summary, the central research question is whether ChatGPT can effectively assist with the screening task for systematic reviews, in terms of consistency, classification performance, and generalizability. The authors aim to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities on this problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is developing an approach to assess the ability of ChatGPT to screen articles for systematic reviews. Specifically, the paper:

- Proposes using ChatGPT, a large language model, to automate the screening of articles for inclusion in systematic reviews. This could help address the challenges of manual screening such as effort and errors.

- Evaluates the consistency, classification performance, and generalizability of ChatGPT for screening articles across multiple datasets from published systematic reviews. 

- Compares ChatGPT to traditional machine learning classifiers like SVM and Naive Bayes that have been used for systematic review automation.

- Finds that ChatGPT achieves comparable performance to traditional classifiers without any training on the datasets. Its decisions are also highly consistent across multiple runs.

- Shows that ChatGPT's performance generalizes to datasets with different characteristics like inclusion ratio and reviewer conflicts. However, its accuracy varies across datasets exhibiting different performance profiles.

- Discusses implications such as the potential to automate rapid reviews, enable small team reviews, and the need to carefully integrate ChatGPT into review tools based on its performance profile.

In summary, the main contribution is an exploratory study that provides initial evidence for the viability of using large language models like ChatGPT to automate the screening phase of systematic reviews, which has traditionally been challenging to automate. The paper systematically assesses ChatGPT's capabilities on this task.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper assesses the ability of ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, to screen articles for inclusion in systematic literature reviews and finds it performs comparably to traditional machine learning methods without requiring additional training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- This paper focuses specifically on assessing ChatGPT's ability to screen articles for systematic reviews. Much of the existing research on using AI/ML for systematic review screening has focused more broadly on developing and evaluating various models, rather than evaluating a specific system like ChatGPT. So this provides a more in-depth look at ChatGPT's capabilities.

- The study design using multiple datasets from published systematic reviews is a strength, as it allows evaluating performance across different topics and corpus characteristics. Many existing studies only use a single dataset. Comparing across datasets provides more insight into the generalizability of ChatGPT.

- The analysis goes beyond overall accuracy metrics to look at consistency, recall, specificity, precision, etc. This provides a more nuanced view of ChatGPT's strengths and weaknesses. Many existing studies just report overall accuracy or AUC. 

- The comparison to traditional ML classifiers (logistic regression, SVM, etc.) trained specifically for each dataset provides useful context for interpreting ChatGPT's performance. The fact that an untrained ChatGPT achieves similar overall performance is noteworthy.

- However, the study is limited to systematic reviews in software engineering. Evaluating additional domains could further elucidate the generalizability of the findings.

- The study doesn't compare to other state-of-the-art NLP systems besides ChatGPT. Comparing to other pretrained language models could reveal insights into model architecture/design choices.

Overall, this paper provides one of the most comprehensive evaluations of using ChatGPT for systematic review screening to date. The multiple dataset comparison and analysis of different performance metrics add significant value compared to much of the existing research. Expanding the evaluation to additional domains and models could further strengthen the conclusions. But this is an important early benchmark for ChatGPT's capabilities on this task.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Investigate the use of other large language models (LLMs) besides ChatGPT for automated screening in systematic reviews, such as Anthropic's Claude, DeepMind's Chinchilla, Meta's OPT, and Allen Institute for AI's Anthropic. Compare their performance to ChatGPT.

- Evaluate ChatGPT on a broader and more diverse set of datasets from different domains beyond software engineering to analyze its generalization capabilities.

- Explore additional prompt engineering techniques beyond the template developed in this study to further optimize the performance of ChatGPT. Look into few-shot learning prompts. 

- Integrate an LLM into existing systematic review tools like ReLiS to develop hybrid human-AI systems. Study the collaboration between human reviewers and LLMs.

- Conduct user studies to evaluate the usability of LLM-powered tools for systematic reviews and their acceptance by researchers.

- Develop functionality in tools to automatically customize the systematic review process based on the observed performance profile of the LLM on a corpus to mitigate risks.

- Explore the use of LLMs for automating other stages of the systematic review process beyond screening, such as query formulation, quality assessment, and data extraction.

- Study the use of LLMs for rapid systematic reviews by entirely automating the screening and using the saved effort for snowballing and validation.

- Develop community standards and best practices around the use of LLMs for evidence synthesis to ensure rigor, transparency, and ethical AI.

In summary, the authors propose future work around evaluating other LLMs, testing generalizability, improving prompts, integration into tools, user studies, automating the full process, rapid reviews, and developing standards.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper assesses the ability of ChatGPT to screen articles for systematic reviews (SRs). The authors investigate the consistency, classification performance, and generalizability of ChatGPT's decisions compared to traditional classifiers on 5 datasets from published SRs. The results show that ChatGPT screens articles consistently, with performance comparable to trained classifiers. Its recall is high, meaning it rarely misses articles to include, while its specificity is moderate, meaning it excludes most irrelevant articles. The comparable performance translates across datasets with different characteristics. However, performance profiles vary: on datasets with typical SR corpus profiles, ChatGPT is conservative including articles; on a dataset with many reviewer conflicts, ChatGPT is too aggressive excluding articles. Overall, the study concludes that ChatGPT is a viable option to assist in screening articles for SRs, achieving good performance without training. But dataset profiles influence its tendencies to include or exclude articles.

Overall, the study provides encouraging evidence that large language models like ChatGPT have potential to aid in evidence synthesis activities like SRs. The authors suggest integrating ChatGPT into SR tools, while accounting for its specific performance profiles on different corpus types. They also discuss implications like enabling rapid reviews and small team/solo SRs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper follows the Data Science method, which is a data-centric analysis approach. The authors first collect five datasets from the ReLiS tool, which contain articles screened for systematic literature reviews along with inclusion/exclusion decisions. They then set up baseline machine learning classifiers (logistic regression, complement naive Bayes, support vector machines, random forest) trained specifically on each dataset. Next, they engineer a prompt template for ChatGPT to screen articles. This prompt contains a context about the review, instructions for ChatGPT, and the title/abstract of the article to screen. They optimize the prompt by sampling datasets and tuning ChatGPT's hyperparameters like temperature. Finally, they run experiments with the baselines and ChatGPT on the datasets, and compare their performance using metrics like recall, precision, specificity, and Matthews correlation to assess ChatGPT's viability in screening articles. The focus is on ChatGPT's consistency, classification performance, and generalization across datasets.
