# [DyBluRF: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields from Blurry Monocular Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10103)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) methods rely on sharp input images to accurately represent dynamic scenes. When faced with motion blur in the input images, these methods struggle to generate high-quality novel views. Handling motion blur in dynamic scene representation remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution (DyBluRF):
The authors propose DyBluRF, a dynamic radiance field approach that can synthesize sharp novel views from a monocular video affected by motion blur. The key ideas are:

1) Model camera and object motion to account for motion blur. The camera trajectory is modeled by estimating poses at discrete timestamps in the exposure time. Object motion is represented by predicting discrete cosine transform (DCT) trajectories. 

2) Perform cross-time rendering using DCT trajectories to establish temporal consistency across frames. This strengthening scene coherence over time.

3) Introduce data-driven depth and optical flow constraints from blurry images through extreme value constraints (EVC). This mitigates inaccuracies in depth/flow predictions.

4) Employ a static scene model to complement the dynamic model for better novel view synthesis quality.

Contributions:

- First dynamic neural radiance field method specifically designed to handle motion blur in input images.

- Novel motion blur formulation using camera poses and DCT trajectories.

- Cross-time rendering approach to ensure consistent temporal coherence. 

- EVC technique to impose reliable constraints from blurry depth/flow predictions.

- Curated datasets of dynamic scenes with motion blur for comparative analysis.

Experiments show DyBluRF outperforms existing dynamic NeRF methods on blurry inputs and generates high-quality novel views that are sharp and temporally consistent.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

DyBluRF is a dynamic radiance field method that can synthesize sharp novel views from a monocular video of a dynamic scene affected by motion blur by modeling both camera and object trajectories over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work include:

1) It introduces DyBluRF, the first dynamic neural radiance field model specifically designed to effectively handle motion-blurred monocular video inputs of dynamic scenes.

2) It proposes a dynamic scene representation method based on modeling the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) trajectories of objects, which simulates motion blur caused by object movements along the predicted trajectories.

3) It presents a cross-time rendering approach that establishes relationships across different exposure times to ensure global temporal consistency of the predicted DCT trajectories in the dynamic scene. 

4) It proposes an effective way to incorporate optical flow and depth maps derived from blurry images to impose constraints on the neural radiance field using Extreme Value Constraints (EVC), mitigating the impact of inaccuracies in those data priors.

In summary, the key contribution is the introduction of the first method to synthesize sharp novel views of dynamic scenes from monocular videos affected by motion blur, through jointly modeling camera and object motion blur as well as ensuring spatial-temporal consistency.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Dynamic neural radiance fields (dynamic NeRF) - The paper focuses on extending neural radiance fields to handle dynamic scenes with motion blur. This involves representing both spatial and temporal information.

- Motion blur - The key challenge this paper aims to address is handling input videos containing motion blur, which degrades the performance of existing dynamic NeRF methods.

- Camera trajectory modeling - To account for motion blur, the method models the camera trajectory within the exposure time by estimating camera poses at discrete timestamps.  

- Object motion trajectories - The approach represents object motion using global Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) trajectories rather than directly establishing inter-frame relationships like optical flow.

- Cross-time rendering - A technique introduced in the paper to ensure consistent temporal relationships across the frames by integrating information across different exposure times.

- Data-driven constraints - Using predicted but inaccurate depth and optical flow from blurry images, with an extreme value constraint (EVC) formulation, to provide constraints.

- Spatial-temporal consistency - A key focus of the method is maintaining spatial-temporal consistency to generate high quality novel views from blurry inputs.

In summary, the key terms cover dynamic scene representation, handling motion blur inputs, and ensuring spatial-temporal consistency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes modeling camera motion by discretizing the exposure time into multiple timestamps and learning camera poses at these timestamps. How is this modeling of camera motion different from previous dynamic NeRF methods? What are the advantages of this approach?

2. The paper models object motion using predicted DCT trajectories rather than using scene flow between adjacent frames. What is the rationale behind using DCT trajectories over scene flow? What are the challenges in using scene flow under blurry input conditions? 

3. Explain the cross-time rendering approach proposed in the paper and how it helps enforce temporal consistency. Why is cross-time rendering performed across the entire temporal range rather than just between adjacent frames?

4. What is extreme value constraint (EVC) and how does it help in incorporating inaccurate depth and optical flow predictions from blurry images? Explain the working principle behind EVC.  

5. The static model with a blending weight is used along with the dynamic model in the approach. What is the motivation behind using this static model? How does it aid the overall representation?

6. Walk through the complete rendering pipeline, explaining how the camera motion, object motion, static model, and cross-time rendering components fit together.

7. The paper claims the approach works well even with sharp inputs. What adaptations are made to handle sharp inputs? Analyze the quantitative results in both sharp and blurry input scenarios.  

8. What are the limitations of the proposed approach? When does it start to struggle in handling motion blur in dynamic scenes?

9. The paper introduces a new dataset of dynamic scenes with motion blur. What was the rationale behind curating a new dataset? What are its distinguishing characteristics?

10. The approach combines multiple loss terms including rendering loss, cross-time rendering loss, scene flow loss etc. Analyze the contribution of each loss term through the quantitative ablation study.
