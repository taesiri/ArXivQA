# [DaFoEs: Mixing Datasets towards the generalization of vision-state   deep-learning Force Estimation in Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Precisely estimating contact forces between surgical tools and tissue during minimally invasive robotic surgery (MIRS) is challenging but important for safe interaction and avoiding tissue damage. 
- Existing solutions like force sensors or physical/mathematical models have limitations in scalability, cost, accuracy across different systems.
- Vision-based deep learning methods show promise but overfit to training data and lack generalization. Lack of large, diverse labeled datasets is also an issue.

Proposed Solution: 
- Present a new vision-haptic dataset (DaFoEs) for soft tissue interaction using a teleoperated robot and commercial instruments.
- Propose a pipeline to mix this dataset with an existing one (dVRK) to improve dataset diversity for training deep networks. Includes data generalization techniques for handling different state vectors, image sources etc.  
- Design neural network architectures combining convolutional (CNN) or vision transformer (ViT) visual encoders with MLP or recurrent (LSTM) decoders to exploit temporal context.
- Show training on mixed datasets improves generalization compared to single datasets. Recurrent models perform best overall and at force peaks.

Main Contributions:
- New diverse vision-haptic surgical dataset (DaFoEs) released publicly
- Technique to mix datasets from different systems/domains to improve deep network generalization 
- Analysis showing improved performance from dataset mixing, especially for recurrent and ViT architectures
- Demonstrates potential of using multiple datasets to move towards a general solution for sensorless force estimation in surgery

The paper highlights dataset mixing and recurrent models as promising directions for sensorless force estimation. Creating more surgical datasets and exploring techniques like simulated data augmentation could further improve generalization.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using a dataset mixing approach to improve generalization of force estimation models. What are some of the key challenges and considerations when combining multiple datasets for model training? How did the authors address issues like differences in state vectors, image quality, etc.?

2. The recurrent neural network models with LSTM decoders seem to perform the best overall. Why do you think the temporal modeling capacity of RNNs provides better force estimation, especially at force peaks? What modifications could be made to further optimize the RNN architectures?

3. The paper explores both convolutional (ResNet50) and transformer (ViT) encoders. What are the relative tradeoffs of these visual encoders? When might one perform better than the other for force estimation? How could they be ensembled?

4. Data augmentation is used, including some "kinematic aware" augmentations that transform the visual and state data consistently. What other data augmentation techniques could further improve model generalization? How much augmentation is too much?

5. The results show model performance varies significantly across training modes (random, stiffness isolation, etc.) and choice of occluded parameters. What does this suggest about the models' robustness? How could more robust models be learned?

6. The model results are only evaluated on a single interaction sequence. How should model evaluation be expanded to better estimate real-world surgical performance? What metrics beyond RMSE should be considered?

7. What types of surgical systems, environments, and interactions would be valuable to add to the datasets to improve model generalization further? Would simulation data be helpful? In vivo data?

8. The state vector relies heavily on robot kinematics and commands. How could additional state data modalities like video-based kinematics further improve estimation accuracy?

9. The paper mentions challenges in sensor selection and data collection for vision-based force estimation research. What novel sensing and data collection methods could unlock further advances?

10. How far away do you think this approach is from being clinically viable? What practical implementation challenges need to be solved first? How might collaborative datasets and models help?
