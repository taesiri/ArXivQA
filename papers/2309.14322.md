# [Small-scale proxies for large-scale Transformer training instabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14322)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question of this paper is: how can we reproduce and study training stability and instability in Transformer models at smaller scales, without access to massive compute resources required for very large models?The authors aim to investigate known issues that lead to training instability at scale, such as the growth of logits in attention layers and divergence of output logits. They show these instabilities can also occur in small models trained at high learning rates, allowing them to be studied without large compute resources. The paper then explores how various optimizer and model interventions affect the sensitivity of final loss to changes in learning rate across scales. Techniques studied include warm-up, weight decay, μParam, and combining methods to achieve stability across orders of magnitude of learning rates.Finally, the authors examine whether instabilities can be predicted before they emerge by looking at scaling trends of model characteristics like activation and gradient norms. They use this to anticipate issues like attention logit growth at larger scales, and search for new potential instabilities in their default settings.In summary, the central aim is to develop techniques to reproduce and understand training stability of Transformers without access to massive compute, by studying small models and scaling trends of model characteristics. This could open up opportunities for more researchers to make impactful contributions in this area.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: how can we reproduce and study training instability in Transformer models at smaller scales, without access to massive compute resources required for very large models?The key hypothesis seems to be that by training small Transformers at high learning rates, it is possible to elicit and study instabilities that have been reported when training giant models. The paper shows this is indeed feasible for two known issues - growth of attention logits and divergence of output logits. It further explores how various optimizations like warmup, weight decay, qk-layernorm etc. affect the learning rate sensitivity and training stability across different scales. Finally, the paper tries to predict and identify potential instabilities that may occur when scaling up, by examining the scaling trends of model characteristics like activation norms and gradient norms. The goal is to develop tools to anticipate and study issues with Transformer training stability without large-scale runs.In summary, the paper aims to develop techniques to reproduce and gain insights into Transformer training instability at smaller scales, instead of only observing them in rare large model runs. This enables more methodical investigation of what causes them and how to address them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents an investigation of training instabilities when scaling up Transformer models. The main contributions are:1. It shows that two known instabilities that emerge at large scale - attention logit growth and output logit divergence - can be reproduced and studied in small models by training at high learning rates. Mitigations that were effective at large scale are also effective for these instabilities in small models.2. It introduces a useful metric called "learning rate (LR) sensitivity" to summarize how sensitive the final validation loss is to changes in learning rate. This metric is used to evaluate the effect of various interventions like warmup, weight decay, and muParam on training stability. 3. It demonstrates that the scaling behavior of model characteristics like gradient norms can be used to predict instabilities before they emerge. Specifically, the attention logit growth instability is predicted by extrapolating the scaling of the max attention logits.  4. It finds that default hyperparameters may need adjustment at larger scales, as gradient norms decrease with scale such that the AdamW epsilon becomes too large. This causes gradient collapse, which is related to parameter norm growth.Overall, the paper enables the study of Transformer training stability without large-scale resources by reproducing instabilities in small models and introducing useful techniques like measuring LR sensitivity. It also sets a precedent for predicting instabilities from scaling trends of model characteristics.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on training stability for large Transformer models:\begin{itemize}\item \textbf{Focus on small-scale experiments}: This paper takes a unique approach by reproducing and studying instabilities in small Transformer models, rather than only at large scale. This allows investigation of stability without huge computational resources. Other related work like Dehghani et al. (2023) and Chowdhery et al. (2022) studied instabilities directly in giant models.\item \textbf{Empirical methodology}: The methodology is heavily empirical and data-driven, relying on experiments across model scales and learning rates. This contrasts with more theoretical analyses like Zhang et al. (2022) and Molybog et al. (2023) which derive stability conditions mathematically.\item \textbf{Summarizing LR curves}: The use of "LR sensitivity" to summarize learning rate vs. loss curves provides a simple metric to compare techniques. Other papers have studied LR tuning but not in this way.\item \textbf{Known instabilities}: Validating known issues like attention collapse and output divergence at small scale is novel. The connection to parameter norm growth is also an interesting observation. \item \textbf{New instability}: Identifying decreased gradient norm as a potential new instability is a unique finding. Adaptive optimizer hyperparameters may need adjustment at scale.\item \textbf{Interventions studied}: The analysis of techniques like warmup, weight decay, and μParam through the lens of LR sensitivity provides new insights on their impact.\item \textbf{Predicting instabilities}: Using scaling trends of model statistics to predict instabilities is innovative and promising for future investigation. Most prior empirical work has focused on post-hoc analysis.\end{itemize}Overall, the small-scale methodology and focus on empirical trends stands out as a distinguishing factor compared to related work. The findings also open up new research directions for the community.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on training stability for large Transformer models:- The focus on reproducing and studying instabilities at small scale is novel. As the authors point out, previous work has mostly studied instabilities as they emerge at large scale during expensive training runs. Studying proxies for these issues in smaller models enables more rapid investigation.- Measuring learning rate sensitivity across scales as a tool to identify and study instabilities is a simple but impactful idea. This provides a concrete metric to evaluate both issues and interventions, complementary to just examining the training loss curves.- The paper reproduces and confirms the effectiveness of known mitigations like qk-layernorm and z-loss regularization in the small scale regime. This further validates the usefulness of the proposed methodology.- Studying how various optimizations like warmup, weight decay, and μParam affect learning rate sensitivity provides new insights into their impact on stability. The finding that longer warmup and decoupled weight decay improve stability aligns with prior intuition.- Analyzing model characteristics like gradient norms to predict instabilities is novel and promising. The authors show this can identify issues like small gradients that may emerge at larger scale. Connecting this to parameter norm growth provides useful mechanistic explanation.- The paper focuses on "slow divergence" issues that emerge during training, complementing another body of work studying fast loss spikes. The references cover important related work on edge of stability dynamics.Overall, I think the paper makes several noteworthy contributions. The small scale methodology enables faster investigation of stability. The analyses yield new insights into known mitigations and characteristics that indicate instability. And the paper sets a strong foundation for future work to build on. The approach looks promising for further study of stability without large-scale resources.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Further investigating the scaling behavior of model characteristics to predict and understand instabilities before they emerge. The authors show some initial examples of using the scaling trends of activation and gradient norms to anticipate potential issues, but suggest more work could be done in this area.- Studying additional optimizer and model interventions through the lens of learning rate sensitivity and how they affect the shape of learning rate vs loss curves across scales. The authors explore several techniques like warmup, weight decay, μParam etc. but there are many other methods that could be analyzed.- Exploring alternative parameterizations like μParam more thoroughly in terms of their impact on training stability across scales. The authors note that techniques like μParam may have advantages in terms of stabilizing the optimal learning rate.- Understanding connections between parameter norm growth, output norm growth, and instabilities like attention logit growth and issues with the AdamW epsilon hyperparameter. The authors provide some initial analysis but suggest further investigation. - Extending the dynamics analysis and mitigations around "fast loss spikes" during large batch training to the setting of adaptive optimizers like AdamW. The authors discuss how techniques like warmup may relate to self-stabilization processes that resolve loss spikes.- Developing techniques to train successfully across wider ranges of learning rates and reduce sensitivity. The authors combine methods like qk-layernorm, z-loss regularization etc. to accomplish this but more work could be done.- Eliminating the need to specify learning rates altogether through automatic methods. The authors note recent work in this direction.So in summary, the authors point to many opportunities for better understanding, predicting and resolving scaling issues, through analysis of model characteristics, new parameterizations, extending theory around loss spikes, and developing automated methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Studying additional model and optimizer interventions in the context of learning rate sensitivity and scaling trends. The paper explored some common techniques like warm-up, weight decay, and the muParam method, but there are many other techniques that could be analyzed in this framework.- Further investigating the ability to predict instabilities from scaling trends of model characteristics before the instabilities emerge. The paper showed some initial examples of this for the attention logit growth instability and issues with the AdamW epsilon hyperparameter. More work could be done to develop frameworks to reliably anticipate and prevent instabilities.- Connecting model scaling trends to theoretical understanding, like recent work on the edge of stability. The paper discusses how phenomena like the attention logit growth could be connected to effects like parameter norm growth. Further developing these theoretical connections could lead to better principles for model scaling.- Studying training stability issues that arise at larger scales than tested in the paper. The largest model trained was 4.8 billion parameters, but modern models are now 10x-100x larger. New issues likely arise at such massive scales that were not captured yet.- Exploring alternatives to learning rate sensitivity for comparing scaling curves, to account for its limitations. As discussed, LR sensitivity has some drawbacks like invariance to loss scale. Better summary metrics could make it easier to compare scaling trends.- Extending the small-scale proxy approach to other model families beyond Transformers. The methodology of using small models with high learning rates could potentially help uncover issues with scaling other architectures.- Searching for additional instabilities and scaling phenomena through further analysis of model characteristics. The paper surface some notable findings but there are likely more insights that could come from creative examination of scaling statistics.So in summary, the authors point to many opportunities for extending the work to better understand, anticipate, and resolve training instabilities across scales. Both broadening the techniques considered and deepening the analysis for Transformers seem like promising future directions based on this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper investigates training stability of Transformer models across different scales. The authors show that two known instabilities that occur at large scale - attention logit growth and output logit divergence - can also be reproduced in small models by training at high learning rates. They propose a metric called learning rate (LR) sensitivity to summarize the relationship between LR and loss, and find it increases with scale. Next, they examine how techniques like warm-up, weight decay, and μParam affect LR sensitivity. One finding is that longer warm-up and independent scaling of LR and weight decay reduce sensitivity. They also predict instabilities from scaling trends of model characteristics - for example, predicting attention logit growth from the scaling behavior of max attention logits. Finally, they identify a new potential issue with default AdamW hyperparameters based on observing decreasing gradient norms, and show reducing epsilon avoids gradient collapse. Overall, the work demonstrates opportunities for studying instability without large-scale resources.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper studies training instability in large Transformer models. The authors show that two known issues that arise in large models - growth of logits in attention layers and divergence of output logits - can be reproduced in small models by training at high learning rates. They introduce a metric called learning rate (LR) sensitivity to summarize how sensitive the final loss is to changes in learning rate, and use this to evaluate mitigations like qk-layernorm and z-loss regularization that have been proposed for large models. These mitigations are equally effective at stabilizing the small models. The authors then systematically evaluate the effect of various other techniques like warmup, weight decay, and μParam on the LR sensitivity. In general, none of these techniques alone allow training over as wide a range of learning rates as qk-layernorm and z-loss. However, longer warmup and independent scaling of weight decay reduce LR sensitivity. The paper concludes by showing how the scaling behavior of model characteristics like activation norms can be used to predict instabilities before they arise. For example, the attention logit growth instability can be anticipated by extrapolating the growth of attention logits with model scale and LR. Overall, the paper demonstrates how small models can provide useful insights into training stability issues in large Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper studies training stability of Transformers at small scale in order to gain insights about instability that arises when training large models. The authors introduce a useful metric called learning rate (LR) sensitivity that measures how sensitive the final validation loss is to variations in the learning rate. Using this metric, they show that two known instabilities that occur at large scale - attention logit growth and output logit divergence - can also occur in small models when using very high learning rates. The paper demonstrates that interventions which mitigate these instabilities at large scale, like qk-layernorm and z-loss regularization, are equally effective for small models at high LR. The authors then investigate how other common techniques like warm-up, weight decay, and μParam affect the LR sensitivity. In general, these interventions do not expand the range of trainable LRs, but can reduce sensitivity within the trainable range. The paper also shows how examining the scaling behavior of model characteristics like activation norms can predict upcoming instabilities before they arise. Using this approach, the authors identify that gradient norms decrease with scale, indicating that the default ε value in AdamW may need to be adjusted at larger scales to avoid gradient collapse. Overall, this work enables studying Transformer instability through small-scale experiments, without requiring access to massive compute resources.
