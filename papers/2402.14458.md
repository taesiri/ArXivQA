# [NLAS-multi: A Multilingual Corpus of Automatically Generated Natural   Language Argumentation Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14458)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Limitations in argument mining, generation, and analysis due to complexity of annotating argumentatively rich data, limited corpus size, and constraints of different languages/domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- Methodology for automatic generation of natural language arguments in different topics and languages using prompting techniques with large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).
- Generated and compiled NLAS-multi, the largest publicly available corpus of 3,810 natural language argumentation schemes based on Walton's model, instantiated in 50 topics and 2 stances each in English and Spanish.

Main Contributions:
- Effective prompt-based methodology to generate structured natural language arguments without need for fine-tuning.
- NLAS-multi corpus - one of the largest and most detailed argumentation scheme corpora available.
- Solid baselines and state-of-the-art results on automatic identification/classification of argument schemes on the corpus.

The methodology allows generating a variety of natural language arguments following the structure of argumentation schemes. The resulting NLAS-multi corpus pushes forward research in argument mining by enabling more advanced analysis. The experiments also show current models can effectively classify argumentation schemes when provided complete natural language arguments.

In summary, the paper presents an impactful corpus and strong baselines to advance research in argument mining and language understanding.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents a methodology to automatically generate a large multilingual corpus of natural language arguments instantiating 20 argumentation schemes on 50 topics in English and Spanish, and provides baselines for argumentation scheme classification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) An effective methodology for the automatic generation of natural language arguments in different topics and languages using prompting techniques with large language models like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.

2) The creation of the largest publicly available corpus of natural language argumentation schemes, called the NLAS-multi corpus, containing 3,810 arguments in English and Spanish generated based on 20 different argumentation schemes.

3) A set of solid baselines and fine-tuned models for the automatic identification/classification of argumentation schemes, achieving very high performance (F1 scores over 99% in some cases) on classifying the reasoning structure of natural language arguments.

In summary, the key innovation is an automatic generation methodology to create a large multilingual corpus of structured arguments, along with models that can accurately classify the reasoning scheme used in natural language arguments. This helps address limitations related to the complexity of manually annotating argumentative data and the limited availability of rich annotated argument corpora.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a prompt-based methodology to generate natural language argumentation schemes. Could you expand more on the design of the prompts and communication strategy used to instantiate the argumentation schemes? What were some of the key challenges faced?

2. The paper conducts two iterations of argument generation using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models. What was the motivation behind this two-step approach? How much improvement was observed between the two iterations?

3. The generated arguments underwent two stages of human validation. What were the criteria used by annotators to label arguments as valid or invalid? What inter-annotator agreement scores were observed?

4. The paper reports better accuracy in generating Spanish arguments compared to English ones in the first iteration. What reasons may account for this difference across languages? 

5. What role did the critical questions of argumentation schemes play in the content analysis of generated arguments to minimize risks in sensitive contexts?

6. The paper presents a new multilingual corpus called NLAS-multi. How does it compare in scale and richness with existing argumentation corpora? What are its limitations?

7. For the task of argumentation scheme classification, two evaluation strategies were employed. Could you elaborate on the motivation and key differences between the homogeneous split and topic-wise split for evaluating the models?

8. The outstanding classification results indicate natural language differences between schemes are distinctive enough. Do you think performance would drop significantly when tested on enthymematic arguments?

9. Beyond classification, what are some potential future applications or tasks that the NLAS-multi corpus could be useful for advancing research in?

10. The paper focuses only on 20 most commonly used argumentation schemes. Do you think expanding the repertoire of schemes poses new challenges for the proposed generation and classification methodology?
