# [NLAS-multi: A Multilingual Corpus of Automatically Generated Natural   Language Argumentation Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14458)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Limitations in argument mining, generation, and analysis due to complexity of annotating argumentatively rich data, limited corpus size, and constraints of different languages/domains.

Proposed Solution: 
- Methodology for automatic generation of natural language arguments in different topics and languages using prompting techniques with large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).
- Generated and compiled NLAS-multi, the largest publicly available corpus of 3,810 natural language argumentation schemes based on Walton's model, instantiated in 50 topics and 2 stances each in English and Spanish.

Main Contributions:
- Effective prompt-based methodology to generate structured natural language arguments without need for fine-tuning.
- NLAS-multi corpus - one of the largest and most detailed argumentation scheme corpora available.
- Solid baselines and state-of-the-art results on automatic identification/classification of argument schemes on the corpus.

The methodology allows generating a variety of natural language arguments following the structure of argumentation schemes. The resulting NLAS-multi corpus pushes forward research in argument mining by enabling more advanced analysis. The experiments also show current models can effectively classify argumentation schemes when provided complete natural language arguments.

In summary, the paper presents an impactful corpus and strong baselines to advance research in argument mining and language understanding.
