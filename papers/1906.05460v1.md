# [Factorized Mutual Information Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05460v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research questions seem to be:

1) What are the sets of joint probability distributions that maximize "factorized" versions of the multi-information, specifically the pairwise factorized multi-information (FMI) and the separated factorized mutual information (SFMI)?

2) How do these sets compare to the sets of distributions that maximize the full multi-information and the mutual information between two subsets of variables?

In particular, the authors are interested in understanding whether maximizing factorized measures can serve as a good proxy for maximizing the actual multi-information or mutual information, which are more computationally complex. 

The main hypotheses seem to be:

- For FMI, the maximizers will coincide with the maximizers of the full multi-information. 

- For SFMI, the maximizers will form a union of "transportation polytopes" that contain some maximizers of the multi-information and some of the mutual information.

So in summary, the central focus is on characterizing and comparing the maximizers of the full multi-information/mutual information versus factorized versions, in order to assess how good the factorized versions are as proxies.
