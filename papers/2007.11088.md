# [Understanding BERT Rankers Under Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11088)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research questions this paper aims to address are:

1) Can knowledge distillation be used to compress large BERT-based neural rankers into smaller, faster models without hurting effectiveness? 

2) What is the best way to distill a BERT ranker? Specifically, what types of knowledge (general language modeling knowledge vs. search-specific relevance knowledge) need to be transferred and what procedures (distillation vs fine-tuning) work the best?

3) How do different distillation configurations and compression rates affect the training and inference behaviors of the distilled rankers? For example, how much training data is needed, how prone to overfitting, etc.

The main hypothesis seems to be that with a proper distillation procedure, it should be possible to substantially compress BERT rankers to achieve much faster query evaluation speed while preserving state-of-the-art accuracy. The authors systematically evaluate different distillation methods and model architectures to verify this hypothesis.

In summary, the key focus is on understanding if and how knowledge distillation can be used to effectively compress BERT neural rankers for improved efficiency. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation and guidelines about the distillation configurations and trade-offs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper outline, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Providing a comprehensive evaluation of distilled BERT rankers for information retrieval. As far as I can tell, this is the first work exploring the use of distillation to improve the efficiency of BERT rankers.

2. Investigating different types of knowledge (general language modeling vs. search-specific relevance modeling) that can be distilled to create a smaller ranker. The results show that distilling both types of knowledge using a proper procedure can produce a much faster ranker (9x speedup) without hurting effectiveness.

3. Analyzing the training implications of different distillation methods. The paper compares convergence behavior, training data requirements, and training time across methods. It provides recommendations on choosing distillation approaches based on importance of offline training time, online latency, etc.

In summary, the key contribution seems to be a comprehensive empirical study on knowledge distillation for creating faster BERT rankers. The experiments reveal insights into how to effectively distill different types of knowledge from BERT into a smaller model, and the tradeoffs around training overhead. This appears to be the first work focused on model compression for BERT rankers in information retrieval.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key point from the paper:

The paper demonstrates how to effectively compress and speed up BERT-based neural ranking models through distillation, achieving up to 9x faster query evaluation without losing effectiveness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a comprehensive study on distilling BERT-based neural rankers to create smaller and faster models without sacrificing effectiveness. Here are some comparisons to other related work:

- Most prior work on compressing BERT focuses on natural language understanding tasks. This is the first work studying BERT compression specifically for ranking in information retrieval. It provides new insights into what knowledge matters most for search.

- The paper systematically evaluates different distillation strategies (e.g. only distilling the fine-tuned ranker versus also distilling the pretrained LM). It shows both types of knowledge are important, which was not examined before. 

- Compared to concurrent work on accelerating BERT rankers via caching/pruning, this paper offers an orthogonal approach through distillation. The techniques are complementary. Distillation has the benefit of not requiring additional storage.

- The paper thoroughly measures tradeoffs between accuracy, inference speedup, and training time. This provides practical advice for system builders depending on their priorities. Most prior BERT compression papers focus only on end accuracy.

- The experiments are conducted on a standard IR benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate 9x speedup while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy, which is very compelling. 

Overall, this paper significantly advances our understanding of compressing neural rankers. It is the first comprehensive study showing BERT can be effectively distilled for search. The analysis of training procedures and tradeoffs is a novel contribution to the literature.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

1. Measure the capability of well-trained distilled models to learn online and adapt to new queries. The authors note it would be interesting to see how distilled models can incrementally update and improve their ranking ability on the fly as new queries come in, without needing full retraining.

2. Explore techniques to shorten the distillation time of highly compressed models. The paper shows smaller distilled models require more training data and time to converge. Methods to accelerate this training process could make distillation more efficient. 

3. Investigate whether the improved generalization of distilled models is due to a regularization effect or other factors. The paper observes distilled models generalize better and are less prone to overfitting compared to directly fine-tuned models. Understanding the cause could further improve distillation techniques.

4. Study combining distillation with other compression techniques like pruning and quantization. The paper focuses on distillation but notes it could be complementary to other methods for model compression. Exploring these combinations could lead to greater efficiency gains.

5. Evaluate distilled models' computational efficiency on specialized hardware like TPUs. The speedup measurements in the paper are on GPUs. TPUs could further accelerate distilled models for ranking.

Overall, the main future direction highlighted is improving the efficiency and applicability of distillation for compressing large ranking models like BERT. The authors lay out several interesting research avenues along this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper studies how to effectively distill knowledge from large BERT-based neural rankers into smaller, faster rankers for information retrieval. The authors investigate different distillation strategies, including only distilling search-specific knowledge from a fine-tuned BERT ranker, first distilling general language modeling knowledge from BERT then fine-tuning, and distilling both general and search-specific knowledge sequentially. Through comprehensive experiments on a benchmark dataset, they demonstrate that properly distilling both types of knowledge allows compressing BERT rankers by 9 times without hurting effectiveness. The results also reveal that smaller distilled rankers require more data to train and converge slower. Based on the findings, the authors provide suggestions on choosing distillation approaches based on different system requirements on online latency, offline training time and model update frequency.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper explores how to effectively transfer knowledge from a large BERT-based neural ranker into a smaller, faster ranker using distillation techniques. The authors evaluate different distillation approaches, including directly distilling a fine-tuned BERT ranker, first distilling BERT's general language modeling knowledge then fine-tuning for search, and distilling both BERT's general knowledge and search-specific knowledge. Experiments on the MS MARCO dataset demonstrate that the most effective approach is to first distill BERT's general language knowledge into a smaller student model, then distill search knowledge from a fine-tuned BERT ranker into that student. This two-stage distillation allows compressing BERT into a 4-6 layer transformer that is 9x faster than BERT with no loss in accuracy. The paper also analyzes training behaviors, showing smaller distilled models require more data and longer training time to converge. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of knowledge distillation for neural rankers, demonstrating the possibility of substantially improving efficiency while retaining effectiveness. It gives recommendations for model compression under different online serving and offline training constraints.

In summary, this paper makes the following key contributions: 1) Comprehensively evaluates distilling BERT rankers for the first time; 2) Shows a proper two-stage distillation procedure allows 9x speedup with no accuracy drop; 3) Analyzes training behaviors of distilled rankers, providing recommendations for different environments. The findings help enable fast yet accurate neural ranking in real-world search systems.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a study on distilling knowledge from large BERT models into smaller neural rankers to improve efficiency while preserving effectiveness. 

The main method is knowledge distillation, where a large pretrained BERT model serves as a teacher to train a smaller student ranker model. Specifically, the paper explores three distillation strategies:

1) Ranker Distill: Distill a fine-tuned BERT ranker into a smaller randomly initialized model. 

2) LM Distill + Fine-tuning: First distill the pretrained BERT language model into a smaller model. Then fine-tune this distilled LM on ranking data.

3) LM Distill + Ranker Distill: First distill BERT LM into a smaller model. Then use a fine-tuned BERT ranker to distill search knowledge into the distilled LM.

The key findings are: Both general language modeling knowledge from BERT and search-specific knowledge need to be distilled for the highest effectiveness. The LM Distill + Ranker Distill strategy works the best, allowing 9x faster query evaluation without losing effectiveness. Smaller distilled models require more data and longer training time to converge.

In summary, the paper provides a comprehensive study on properly distilling both general and search-specific knowledge from BERT into much smaller neural rankers using knowledge distillation techniques.
