# [Neural Spectral Methods: Self-supervised learning in the spectral domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05225)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper proposes Neural Spectral Methods (NSM), a machine learning technique for solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) that is grounded in classical spectral methods. The key idea is to represent PDE solutions using orthogonal basis functions and learn mappings between the spectral coefficients of the parameters and solutions. In contrast to current approaches that enforce PDE constraints by minimizing residuals in the spatiotemporal domain, NSM introduces a spectral loss that leverages Parseval's identity to enable more efficient differentiation and substantially reduce training complexity. Experiments on Poisson, Reaction-Diffusion, and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate NSM's superior accuracy and efficiency, with over 100x speedup during training and 500x during inference compared to grid-based methods trained with physics-informed neural network losses. NSM also maintains constant computational cost regardless of spatiotemporal resolution. Compared to iterative numerical solvers of equivalent accuracy, NSM exhibits approximately 10x faster performance. Limitations include requiring sufficient regularity of solutions and extension to high-dimensional problems. Overall, the proposed spectral framework enables more effective incorporation of prior physical knowledge and provides a promising direction for data-efficient and fast PDE solvers.
