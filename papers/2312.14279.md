# [Characterizing and Classifying Developer Forum Posts with their   Intentions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14279)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
With the rapid growth of online developer communities, the large volume of posts poses difficulties for users to filter useful information and find relevant content. Most existing tags for organizing posts focus on technical aspects and fail to capture the intentions behind the posts. Modeling intentions can provide an additional dimension for categorizing posts to improve search and recommendation.

Solution:
The authors first conducted a qualitative study on a sampled dataset to analyze the composition and intentions of posts across multiple developer forums. Based on findings and industry feedback, they devised a taxonomy of 7 intention categories for technical posts: Discrepancy, Error, Review, Conceptual, Learning, How-to and Other. A manual annotation process was carried out to label post intentions on 784 sampled posts. 

The authors then proposed an automated intention detection framework leveraging transformer-based pre-trained language models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa). The framework encodes the title and description of a post separately and combines them into an embedding. Additional features like code block content type and text metrics are incorporated. The features then pass through fully-connected layers to output multi-label intention predictions. Further fine-tuning of the pre-trained models brought performance improvements.

Contributions:
- A refined taxonomy of technical post intentions incorporating industry perspectives
- Analysis of correlations between post content types and intentions 
- A manually annotated intention dataset of 784 technical forum posts
- An automated intention detection framework outperforming state-of-the-art baselines
- Evaluation of multiple pre-trained language models for intention detection
- Guidelines for improving posting practices and utilizing intentions to enhance search/recommendation

The proposed taxonomy and intention detection approach can help organize posts and improve retrieval of relevant content in technical forums to benefit both users and tool developers.
