# [A Structural-Clustering Based Active Learning for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04307)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel active learning approach for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) called Structural-Clustering PageRank (SPA), which synergizes community detection using the SCAN algorithm with the PageRank node scoring method. SPA aims to select the most informative and structurally central nodes in a graph to query labels for, in order to maximize learning efficiency. Through extensive experiments on node classification tasks over diverse graph datasets, SPA demonstrates superior performance over existing methods across varying annotation budgets, achieving higher accuracy and Macro-F1 scores using fewer labeled samples. A key advantage of SPA is the notable reduction in computational complexity and query time compared to recent state-of-the-art active learning techniques for GNNs. While showing promising results, the authors acknowledge the need for further optimization for large-scale complex graphs. Overall, by strategically combining feature and topological information, SPA significantly advances active learning for GNNs on graph-structured data.
