# [Ensemble-based Blackbox Attacks on Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop an effective approach for generating blackbox adversarial attacks against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation networks?

Specifically, the paper proposes using an ensemble of surrogate models to craft adversarial examples that can transfer to unseen victim models, rather than relying on a single surrogate as done in prior work. The key ideas explored are:

1) Balancing the loss contributions from different surrogate models in the ensemble, since they may use very different losses. 

2) Optimizing the ensemble weights according to victim model feedback to further improve attack success.

The main hypothesis is that an ensemble-based approach with proper weighting and optimization can generate more effective blackbox attacks compared to methods based on single surrogate models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, this paper focuses on designing an ensemble-based framework to generate adversarial examples that can fool arbitrary blackbox models for dense prediction tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, with a particular emphasis on improving targeted attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective ensemble-based blackbox attack method for dense prediction models such as object detectors and semantic segmentation models. The key ideas are:

- Using an ensemble of surrogate models instead of a single model to generate more transferable adversarial examples.

- Introducing weight balancing and weight optimization techniques to improve the attack success rate. Weight balancing normalizes the loss contribution of each surrogate model. Weight optimization tunes the contribution of each surrogate model according to the victim model. 

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments on attacking various state-of-the-art object detectors and segmentation models. The method achieves higher attack success rates compared to prior arts, especially for targeted attacks.

- Showing the proposed ensemble attack can fool multiple dense prediction models and tasks using a single adversarial example.

In summary, the main contribution is an ensemble-based blackbox attack framework that leverages weight balancing and optimization to achieve high attack success rates for both untargeted and more challenging targeted attacks on object detection and semantic segmentation models. The method requires only a small number of queries.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble-based blackbox attack method that leverages weight normalization and optimization techniques to generate more effective adversarial examples against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel ensemble-based approach for generating blackbox adversarial attacks against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation networks. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work in this area:

- Most prior blackbox attack methods focus on image classification models. There is relatively less work on attacking dense prediction models, especially in a blackbox setting. This paper helps advance research on blackbox attacks for dense computer vision tasks.

- The proposed ensemble-based attack outperforms existing blackbox attack methods for both object detection and segmentation. It achieves higher success rates for targeted attacks using fewer queries compared to recent methods like context-aware attack [1]. 

- The use of ensemble for blackbox attacks is not new, but this paper shows carefully balancing and optimizing the ensemble can significantly boost attack success rates. The weight normalization and optimization strategies are simple yet effective.

- Compared to generic query-based attacks that require thousands of queries, this method needs only 5-20 queries by combining transfer attack with limited queries.

- Extensive experiments are presented including both untargeted and more challenging targeted attacks. The attacks are shown to work on different model architectures and datasets. Attacks on multiple tasks are demonstrated.

- The method can fool multiple dense prediction models like detectors and segmentation networks simultaneously using a single universal perturbation. Such joint attacks have not been shown before.

Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in blackbox attacks for dense prediction models. The proposed ensemble approach and weight optimization strategies are simple but powerful ideas for boosting attack success rates. By needing fewer queries, the attacks are more practical. The comprehensive experiments and joint attacks results are valuable additions to the literature.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more effective techniques for blackbox attacks on dense prediction models besides object detection and segmentation, such as depth estimation, keypoint detection, etc. The authors' ensemble-based attack methodology could potentially be extended to these other tasks.

- Exploring how to further reduce the number of queries needed to achieve high attack success rates. The authors show good results with only 5-20 queries, but reducing this even more would be desirable.

- Designing better defense methods specifically tailored to defending against ensemble-based blackbox attacks. The authors mention that existing defense methods mainly focus on single model attacks.

- Studying the tradeoffs between transferability and perceptibility of attacks generated using ensemble methods compared to single surrogate attacks. The authors suggest ensemble attacks may lead to more imperceptible perturbations.

- Evaluating the effectiveness of ensemble attacks and defenses on real-world deployed systems, not just academic models. Testing in more realistic threat scenarios is an important direction.

- Extending the ensemble attack approach to other input modalities like audio, video, etc. The current work focuses on attacking image classifiers.

- Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of why ensemble-based attacks are able to transfer better than single model attacks. This could lead to more fundamental defenses.

In summary, the main themes are developing ensemble attacks for broader dense prediction tasks, requiring fewer queries, designing tailored defenses, evaluating in more realistic settings, and further understanding the theory behind ensemble attacks. Advancing research in these directions could lead to more robust dense prediction systems.
