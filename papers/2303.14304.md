# [Ensemble-based Blackbox Attacks on Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop an effective approach for generating blackbox adversarial attacks against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation networks?

Specifically, the paper proposes using an ensemble of surrogate models to craft adversarial examples that can transfer to unseen victim models, rather than relying on a single surrogate as done in prior work. The key ideas explored are:

1) Balancing the loss contributions from different surrogate models in the ensemble, since they may use very different losses. 

2) Optimizing the ensemble weights according to victim model feedback to further improve attack success.

The main hypothesis is that an ensemble-based approach with proper weighting and optimization can generate more effective blackbox attacks compared to methods based on single surrogate models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, this paper focuses on designing an ensemble-based framework to generate adversarial examples that can fool arbitrary blackbox models for dense prediction tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, with a particular emphasis on improving targeted attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective ensemble-based blackbox attack method for dense prediction models such as object detectors and semantic segmentation models. The key ideas are:

- Using an ensemble of surrogate models instead of a single model to generate more transferable adversarial examples.

- Introducing weight balancing and weight optimization techniques to improve the attack success rate. Weight balancing normalizes the loss contribution of each surrogate model. Weight optimization tunes the contribution of each surrogate model according to the victim model. 

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments on attacking various state-of-the-art object detectors and segmentation models. The method achieves higher attack success rates compared to prior arts, especially for targeted attacks.

- Showing the proposed ensemble attack can fool multiple dense prediction models and tasks using a single adversarial example.

In summary, the main contribution is an ensemble-based blackbox attack framework that leverages weight balancing and optimization to achieve high attack success rates for both untargeted and more challenging targeted attacks on object detection and semantic segmentation models. The method requires only a small number of queries.
