# [Ensemble-based Blackbox Attacks on Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14304)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we develop an effective approach for generating blackbox adversarial attacks against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation networks?

Specifically, the paper proposes using an ensemble of surrogate models to craft adversarial examples that can transfer to unseen victim models, rather than relying on a single surrogate as done in prior work. The key ideas explored are:

1) Balancing the loss contributions from different surrogate models in the ensemble, since they may use very different losses. 

2) Optimizing the ensemble weights according to victim model feedback to further improve attack success.

The main hypothesis is that an ensemble-based approach with proper weighting and optimization can generate more effective blackbox attacks compared to methods based on single surrogate models. The experiments aim to validate this hypothesis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, this paper focuses on designing an ensemble-based framework to generate adversarial examples that can fool arbitrary blackbox models for dense prediction tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation, with a particular emphasis on improving targeted attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an effective ensemble-based blackbox attack method for dense prediction models such as object detectors and semantic segmentation models. The key ideas are:

- Using an ensemble of surrogate models instead of a single model to generate more transferable adversarial examples.

- Introducing weight balancing and weight optimization techniques to improve the attack success rate. Weight balancing normalizes the loss contribution of each surrogate model. Weight optimization tunes the contribution of each surrogate model according to the victim model. 

- Demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments on attacking various state-of-the-art object detectors and segmentation models. The method achieves higher attack success rates compared to prior arts, especially for targeted attacks.

- Showing the proposed ensemble attack can fool multiple dense prediction models and tasks using a single adversarial example.

In summary, the main contribution is an ensemble-based blackbox attack framework that leverages weight balancing and optimization to achieve high attack success rates for both untargeted and more challenging targeted attacks on object detection and semantic segmentation models. The method requires only a small number of queries.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble-based blackbox attack method that leverages weight normalization and optimization techniques to generate more effective adversarial examples against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel ensemble-based approach for generating blackbox adversarial attacks against dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation networks. Here are some key ways it compares to prior work in this area:

- Most prior blackbox attack methods focus on image classification models. There is relatively less work on attacking dense prediction models, especially in a blackbox setting. This paper helps advance research on blackbox attacks for dense computer vision tasks.

- The proposed ensemble-based attack outperforms existing blackbox attack methods for both object detection and segmentation. It achieves higher success rates for targeted attacks using fewer queries compared to recent methods like context-aware attack [1]. 

- The use of ensemble for blackbox attacks is not new, but this paper shows carefully balancing and optimizing the ensemble can significantly boost attack success rates. The weight normalization and optimization strategies are simple yet effective.

- Compared to generic query-based attacks that require thousands of queries, this method needs only 5-20 queries by combining transfer attack with limited queries.

- Extensive experiments are presented including both untargeted and more challenging targeted attacks. The attacks are shown to work on different model architectures and datasets. Attacks on multiple tasks are demonstrated.

- The method can fool multiple dense prediction models like detectors and segmentation networks simultaneously using a single universal perturbation. Such joint attacks have not been shown before.

Overall, this paper pushes the state-of-the-art in blackbox attacks for dense prediction models. The proposed ensemble approach and weight optimization strategies are simple but powerful ideas for boosting attack success rates. By needing fewer queries, the attacks are more practical. The comprehensive experiments and joint attacks results are valuable additions to the literature.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more effective techniques for blackbox attacks on dense prediction models besides object detection and segmentation, such as depth estimation, keypoint detection, etc. The authors' ensemble-based attack methodology could potentially be extended to these other tasks.

- Exploring how to further reduce the number of queries needed to achieve high attack success rates. The authors show good results with only 5-20 queries, but reducing this even more would be desirable.

- Designing better defense methods specifically tailored to defending against ensemble-based blackbox attacks. The authors mention that existing defense methods mainly focus on single model attacks.

- Studying the tradeoffs between transferability and perceptibility of attacks generated using ensemble methods compared to single surrogate attacks. The authors suggest ensemble attacks may lead to more imperceptible perturbations.

- Evaluating the effectiveness of ensemble attacks and defenses on real-world deployed systems, not just academic models. Testing in more realistic threat scenarios is an important direction.

- Extending the ensemble attack approach to other input modalities like audio, video, etc. The current work focuses on attacking image classifiers.

- Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of why ensemble-based attacks are able to transfer better than single model attacks. This could lead to more fundamental defenses.

In summary, the main themes are developing ensemble attacks for broader dense prediction tasks, requiring fewer queries, designing tailored defenses, evaluating in more realistic settings, and further understanding the theory behind ensemble attacks. Advancing research in these directions could lead to more robust dense prediction systems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an ensemble-based blackbox attack method for dense prediction tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. The key ideas are:

1) Attacks generated by a single surrogate model have low transferability. 

2) Using an ensemble of surrogate models with proper weight normalization improves attack transferability.

3) Further optimizing the ensemble weights according to victim model feedback boosts attack success.  

The method combines transfer-based and query-based attacks. Extensive experiments on targeted and untargeted attacks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on object detection and segmentation. The approach can also generate universal perturbations to fool multiple models and tasks simultaneously. This is the first targeted and query-based attack method for segmentation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here are two paragraphs summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes an ensemble-based blackbox attack method for dense prediction models like object detectors and semantic segmentation networks. The method generates adversarial examples using an ensemble of surrogate models. The authors show that balancing the loss contribution from each surrogate model and optimizing the ensemble weights according to victim model feedback are critical for attack success. Experiments demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing blackbox attack methods, achieving high targeted attack success rates on object detectors and segmentation models using only 5-20 queries. The method also allows attacking multiple detection and segmentation models simultaneously with a single perturbation.

The authors first show that attacks generated by a single surrogate model often fail to transfer to blackbox models. They propose weight balancing to normalize the contribution of each surrogate model, ensuring all models are fooled simultaneously to improve transferability. Weight optimization further adjusts the ensemble weights based on victim model feedback to enhance attacks for that specific model. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of these techniques. On object detection, their method attains 29-53% targeted attack success with 5 queries, surpassing the state-of-the-art method's 20-39% success. For segmentation, they achieve 0.9-1.55% mIoU on untargeted attacks and 69-95% pixel-wise success on targeted attacks, outperforming prior arts. Finally, joint attacks using both detection and segmentation surrogates can fool multiple blackbox models simultaneously.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes an ensemble-based blackbox attack method for objection detection and semantic segmentation models. It utilizes an ensemble of surrogate models to generate adversarial examples. The method has two key components: 1) weight balancing, which normalizes the contribution of each surrogate model in the ensemble by scaling its loss function, to ensure attacks fool all models simultaneously; and 2) weight optimization, which tunes the weights of surrogate models based on feedback from the victim model to further optimize attack success. By carefully designing the ensemble with these two ideas, the method is able to generate more transferable attacks compared to using a single surrogate model. The ensemble attack generation can be viewed as a combination of transfer- and query-based attacks, requiring only a small number of queries (5-20). Experiments show the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on targeted and untargeted blackbox attacks for object detection and segmentation compared to existing methods.

 The paper is addressing the problem of generating adversarial attacks against dense prediction models (i.e. object detectors and semantic segmentation models) in the blackbox setting. Specifically, it focuses on targeted attacks, which aim to perturb an input image such that the model predicts a specific target output. 

The key research questions addressed in the paper are:

- How to generate effective blackbox adversarial attacks against dense prediction models using an ensemble of surrogate models?

The paper aims to show that techniques like weight balancing and optimization can significantly boost performance compared to prior arts. It also demonstrates multi-task attacks on detection and segmentation models together.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel approach for generating adversarial attacks against blackbox dense prediction models, including object detectors and semantic segmentation networks. The key idea is to leverage an ensemble of surrogate models to craft the attacks. Through comprehensive experiments, the authors make two critical observations: 1) Normalizing the loss contributions of each surrogate model is crucial for attack success, as some models yield much higher losses. 2) Further optimizing the ensemble weights according to the victim model can refine the attacks. Based on these findings, the authors introduce weight balancing and weight optimization techniques. Their approach outperforms prior arts across targeted and untargeted attacks on object detection and segmentation. For instance, it achieves 29-53% targeted attack success with only 5 queries, substantially higher than a state-of-the-art method.
