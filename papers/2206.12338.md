# [Diegetic Representation of Feedback in Open Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12338)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: How can we represent the feedback and counterfactual analysis underlying Nash equilibria in the dynamics of open games themselves, rather than through external constructs?The key points are:- The paper proposes a new notion of "diegetic open games" where the feedback and analysis leading to Nash equilibria is represented within the game dynamics. - This is achieved by propagating full payoff functions through the game using a "coplay" function determined functorially from the "play" function, analogous to backpropagation. - Players' optimization dynamics are then embedded in the game as well, represented by "selection lenses" that encapsulate their strategy analysis. - This provides a more accurate and intrinsic representation of strategic gameplay compared to prior open game frameworks. - The diegetic representation also reveals formal analogies with gradient-based machine learning, suggesting commonalities in their categorical treatment of backpropagation-like dynamics.So in summary, the central research question is how to intrinsically capture strategic gameplay in open games, which this paper addresses through the proposed diegetic representation integrating feedback and player strategy analysis within game dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new framework for modeling strategic games called "diegetic open games". The key ideas are:- Representing the full payoff functions as part of the game dynamics rather than just pointwise payoffs. This allows propagating payoff information through the game via a backpropagation-like mechanism.- Clearly separating the "arena" (encoding the game structure and dynamics) from the "players" (encoding strategy spaces, deviations, and optimization). Players are modeled as systems over the arena. - Showing that finding Nash equilibria in these games corresponds to finding fixpoint behaviors of the player systems. This connects to recent work on categorical systems theory.- Drawing analogies between the backpropagation of payoffs in games and techniques like reverse-mode automatic differentiation used in gradient-based learning. This suggests commonalities between game theory, learning theory, and cybernetics.Overall, the new "diegetic" framework aims to provide a more accurate and compositional representation of strategic games compared to prior versions of open games. The conceptual innovations also point to potential for further unifying theories of decision making systems.
