# [Diegetic Representation of Feedback in Open Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12338)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is: 

How can we represent the feedback and counterfactual analysis underlying Nash equilibria in the dynamics of open games themselves, rather than through external constructs?

The key points are:

- The paper proposes a new notion of "diegetic open games" where the feedback and analysis leading to Nash equilibria is represented within the game dynamics. 

- This is achieved by propagating full payoff functions through the game using a "coplay" function determined functorially from the "play" function, analogous to backpropagation. 

- Players' optimization dynamics are then embedded in the game as well, represented by "selection lenses" that encapsulate their strategy analysis. 

- This provides a more accurate and intrinsic representation of strategic gameplay compared to prior open game frameworks. 

- The diegetic representation also reveals formal analogies with gradient-based machine learning, suggesting commonalities in their categorical treatment of backpropagation-like dynamics.

So in summary, the central research question is how to intrinsically capture strategic gameplay in open games, which this paper addresses through the proposed diegetic representation integrating feedback and player strategy analysis within game dynamics.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a new framework for modeling strategic games called "diegetic open games". The key ideas are:

- Representing the full payoff functions as part of the game dynamics rather than just pointwise payoffs. This allows propagating payoff information through the game via a backpropagation-like mechanism.

- Clearly separating the "arena" (encoding the game structure and dynamics) from the "players" (encoding strategy spaces, deviations, and optimization). Players are modeled as systems over the arena. 

- Showing that finding Nash equilibria in these games corresponds to finding fixpoint behaviors of the player systems. This connects to recent work on categorical systems theory.

- Drawing analogies between the backpropagation of payoffs in games and techniques like reverse-mode automatic differentiation used in gradient-based learning. This suggests commonalities between game theory, learning theory, and cybernetics.

Overall, the new "diegetic" framework aims to provide a more accurate and compositional representation of strategic games compared to prior versions of open games. The conceptual innovations also point to potential for further unifying theories of decision making systems.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on compositional game theory:

- It builds directly on previous work by the authors on "open games", continuing to develop the conceptual framework and formalism. In particular, it aims to address some limitations with the prior "open games with agency" approach. 

- Compared to other categorical approaches to game theory like extensive form games, it focuses more on strategic/normal form games and representing the strategic reasoning process. The goal is representing games "diegetically" to capture players' counterfactual analysis within the game dynamics.

- The key conceptual innovation seems to be propagating entire payoff functions through the game via a "coplay" constructed functorially from "play". This allows representing how players observe payoffs during play.

- Relating this to gradient-based learning provides a nice link between game theory and ML. The analogies like strategies/parameters, payoffs/loss functions, and selection/gradient flow are insightful. This connects to a broader theme of "categorical cybernetics".

- Overall, the conceptual reframing and added expressiveness could potentially enable new applications in compositional game theory. But it's still early stage research - the paper mostly focuses on foundational ideas rather than applications.

- Compared to other game theory formalisms, it's less detailed on solution concepts like Nash equilibria. The treatment is quite high-level. More work may be needed to develop the technical details and tools for analysis.

So in summary, it offers a novel conceptual perspective extending the authors' prior open games work, with potentially promising connections to ML and categorical systems theory. But the practical benefits remain to be demonstrated. More development of the technical foundations seems needed as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper proposes a new framework for modeling games called "diegetic open games". Some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing a more general theory of specification and simulation of cybernetic systems, building on categorical systems theory. This would allow for a principled, compositional way to extract Nash equilibria and study non-equilibrium game dynamics.

- Exploring how the new definition of games can improve compositional game theory, especially regarding Bayesian games, learning dynamics, and concepts like coarsening and ossification.

- Formalizing the analogy between gradient-based learners and games into an abstract theory of backpropagation. This would make precise the intuitive notion of states, changes, scalars, and feedbacks in these systems.

- Applying the framework to Bayesian games with incomplete information and learning, connecting it to existing work on Bayesian lenses. 

- Defining subgame-perfect equilibria and other game solution concepts in the new framework.

- Further developing the conceptual analogies between games, learners, and Bayesian reasoners into a unifying categorical cybernetic systems theory.

In summary, the main suggestions are to build on the new compositional modeling approach to study game dynamics and solution concepts categorically, unify it with related cybernetic systems, and apply it to broaden the scope of compositional game theory. Formalizing backpropagation abstractly is also highlighted as an important direction for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces a new framework for representing strategic games compositionally, called "diegetic open games". The key ideas are:

1) Representing the full payoff functions as they are propagated through the game, analogous to backpropagation in machine learning. This allows capturing the entire game dynamics within the specification. 

2) Clearly separating the "arena" (encoding the game structure and dynamics) from the "players" (representing strategy selection and optimization). Players are modeled as parametric lenses over the arena. 

3) Showing that "fixpoint behaviors" of the game systems correspond to Nash equilibria. This links to recent categorical frameworks for dynamical systems. 

Overall, the framework provides a more refined compositional representation of game dynamics and strategic reasoning. It also reveals formal analogies between game theory and machine learning through the lens of categorical cybernetics. The improved conceptual picture sets the stage for further developments in compositional game theory and abstract backpropagation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new framework for modeling strategic games called "diegetic open games." The key idea is to represent the full dynamics of a game, including players' analysis of payoffs and deviations from current strategies, within the specification of the game itself (hence "diegetic"). This is done by propagating entire payoff functions through the game using machinery analogous to backpropagation and automatic differentiation. 

Specifically, payoff functions are viewed as elements of an exponential object $P^X$ and propagated via a functor $P^*$. This allows player strategies to depend on full payoff continuations rather than pointwise payoffs. Players are then modeled as lenses over the game "arena" that update strategies based on propagated payoffs. It is shown that the resulting framework integrates well with the theory of compositional games and subsumes previous notions of "open games with agency." Furthermore, formal analogies are drawn with gradient-based learning, suggesting commonalities between game theory and machine learning. Overall, the paper provides an improved compositional framework for game theory with greater conceptual clarity.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new framework for modeling strategic games called "diegetic open games." It improves on previous open game frameworks by representing players' counterfactual analysis and emergence of Nash equilibria within the game dynamics itself (diegetically). This is achieved by propagating full payoff functions through the game via a functor that resembles reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Players are then modeled as systems that reparameterize the game arena based on their payoff observations, selecting optimal strategies. The paper shows this method can reproduce Nash equilibria while aligning conceptually with how gradient-based learners are specified. Overall, the diegetic open game framework provides a compositional, dynamical way to model strategic games and players' decision processes.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of representing feedback and counterfactual analysis in strategic games in a "diegetic" way, meaning within the dynamics of the game itself rather than externally. The key ideas seem to be:

- Representing the full payoff functions in the specification of the game, rather than just pointwise payoffs. This allows propagating payoff information through the game arena similarly to backpropagation. 

- Formally identifying the "arena" (game structure) and "players" (strategy and deviation selection) as separate components. The players are represented as a system over the arena.

- Showing that with this approach, the players' fixpoint behaviors correspond to Nash equilibria of the game. 

- Drawing an analogy between this diegetic feedback for games and backpropagation in gradient-based machine learning. Things like payoff functions, coplay, and selection functions play similar roles to loss functions, reverse derivatives, and gradient ascent.

So in summary, it is providing a new compositional framework for specifying games that makes the strategic reasoning of players explicit and connects it to related ideas like backpropagation. This addresses limitations in prior "open games" approaches.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new framework for specifying and analyzing open games in a compositional, "diegetic" way. It builds on prior work on open games with agency, but addresses some conceptual flaws, chiefly the lack of an explicit role for players' counterfactual reasoning in the game dynamics. The key innovation is representing the flow of payoff information through functorial "coplays" that are like reverse derivatives, propagating complete payoff functions rather than scalars. This allows incorporating players' selection functions as optimization dynamics within the game system itself. Nash equilibria emerge as fixpoints of the resulting nondeterministic parametric lenses. The framework draws analogies with backpropagation in gradient-based learning, with payoff functions as covectors and selection functions as “raising indices”. Overall, it offers a more faithful and compositional representation of strategic reasoning, with potential applications in computational game theory and connections to categorical cybernetics.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper improves upon the framework of open games with agency by showing how players' counterfactual analysis giving rise to Nash equilibria can be described within the dynamics of the game itself (diegetically), without needing devices like equilibrium predicates. This new approach makes the specification of games closely match that of gradient-based learners. Feedback propagation in games is shown to be analogous to backpropagation, with a key difference explaining the unique phenomenology of non-cooperative games. The paper outlines a functorial construction of game arenas, shows players form a subsystem over it, and proves their 'fixpoint behaviors' are Nash equilibria. Overall, it provides a more realistic modeling of strategic reasoning and highlights formal connections between game theory, machine learning, and cybernetic systems.
