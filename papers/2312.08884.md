# [Global Rewards in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous   Mobility on Demand Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08884)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper studies the problem of vehicle dispatching in autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems, where a central operator controls a fleet of autonomous vehicles to serve transportation requests from customers. The goal is to maximize the total profit of the system by deciding which requests to serve and assigning vehicles accordingly. Recent approaches using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) train agents based on local per-vehicle rewards, which can distort the global profit signal and lead to suboptimal policies.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel MADRL algorithm that trains agents via global system-level rewards to align their objectives with maximizing the global profit. It assigns rewards to agents using a counterfactual baseline that estimates each agent's contribution to the global reward. Specifically, it extends the Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradient (COMA) credit assignment approach into a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework for discrete actions. To scale the approach, the paper also proposes a scheduled algorithm that combines local and global rewards.

Main Contributions:
- A new credit assignment method for MADRL that embeds COMA into SAC to estimate per-agent advantages using a counterfactual baseline
- A scheduled algorithm called COMA^scd that combines local and global rewards to scale the approach to large instances
- Evaluations on real-world taxi data showing COMA^scd outperforms state-of-the-art local-rewards MADRL by up to 2% on average and 6% on individual test dates  
- Structural analysis indicating global rewards improve implicit vehicle balancing and demand forecasting abilities compared to local rewards

The paper sets a new state-of-the-art for vehicle dispatching in AMoD systems using MADRL. The proposed combination of SAC and COMA is also generally applicable for multi-agent learning problems requiring credit assignment.
