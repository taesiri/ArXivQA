## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "A Survey of Reasoning with Foundation Models: Concepts, Methodologies, and Outlook":

Problem:
Reasoning is a crucial capability for intelligent systems. With the rise of foundation models like LLMs, there is growing interest in exploring their reasoning abilities. However, existing surveys have focused on specific aspects and do not provide a comprehensive overview connecting the different research efforts in reasoning with foundation models. 

Solution:
This paper provides a systematic survey of reasoning with foundation models. It discusses key concepts, categorizes reasoning tasks into commonsense, mathematical, logical, causal, visual, audio, multimodal and embodied reasoning. It highlights techniques like pre-training, fine-tuning, alignment training, mixture-of-experts, in-context learning and autonomous agents. The paper also examines benchmarks, datasets and metrics for evaluating reasoning.  

Contributions:
- Comprehensive taxonomy of reasoning tasks and techniques for foundation models
- Analysis of over 650 recent papers on reasoning with foundation models
- Discussion of seminal models proposed for reasoning tasks
- Overview of benchmarks, datasets and metrics to evaluate reasoning
- Outlook on future directions like safety, interpretability, science reasoning and super alignment

The paper connects research efforts in diverse reasoning tasks using foundation models. By providing structured analysis across concepts, tasks, techniques and evaluations, it delivers valuable insights to researchers to advance reasoning with foundation models towards more aligned and beneficial AI systems.
