# [GIT-Net: Generalized Integral Transform for Operator Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02450)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper introduces GIT-Net, a novel neural network architecture for learning operators that map between function spaces to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). GIT-Net is inspired by the observation that many PDE operators can be diagonalized when represented in certain bases, such as the Fourier basis. GIT-Net parametrizes adaptive generalized integral transforms using neural networks to transform between appropriately chosen bases. This allows GIT-Net to achieve improved accuracy and flexibility compared to rigid integral transforms like the Fourier transform. A key feature of GIT-Net is its use of PCA to enable robustness to different mesh discretizations of the function spaces. Experiments on various PDEs with complex geometries demonstrate that GIT-Net achieves the lowest test errors in the large data regime compared to other methods like PCA-Net, POD-DeepONet, and FNO. Notably, GIT-Net attains comparable accuracy to FNO on problems with rectangular grids, but outperforms FNO significantly on problems with complex geometries. GIT-Net also exhibits favorable computational complexity, scaling as O(N_p) in the number of sampling points N_p, compared to O(N_p log N_p) for FNO. These properties make GIT-Net a highly competitive neural network operator for efficiently and accurately solving PDEs in diverse settings.
