# [Decentralised and collaborative machine learning framework for IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12190)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decentralized machine learning is needed for IoT devices to collaboratively build models while protecting data privacy and security. However, existing approaches like federated learning have limitations around dependence on a central server.

Solution:
- Proposes a decentralized and collaborative machine learning framework for resource-constrained IoT devices. Main components:
  - XuILVQ - An incremental learning algorithm based on prototypes that can work on low-power devices
  - Two protocols for nodes to share local prototypes with peers: Random sharing protocol and Relative threshold protocol
  - Two approaches for prediction and prototype creation: Fully ILVQ using XuILVQ end-to-end, and a Hybrid approach using XuILVQ for prototypes and Adaptive Random Forest for prediction

Contributions:
- Implements and evaluates XuILVQ, an adaptation of ILVQ incremental learning algorithm, in Python River library. Adds class prediction and threshold distance computation.
- Proposes a decentralized system where nodes run XuILVQ and share prototypes using peer-to-peer protocols. This allows collaborative learning without a central server.
- Evaluates framework with 5-7 node networks on a phishing dataset. Shows decentralised approach attains under 10% gap vs. centralized learning while using less than 1/5 training data.
- Analysis provides guidance on optimal sharing parameters to balance performance gains vs. network load. Sharing level of 0.05-0.2 gives good outcomes.

In summary, the paper presents a decentralized machine learning framework tailored for IoT devices that can match centralized performance while enhancing privacy and security. The peer-to-peer prototype sharing approach is the main innovation.
