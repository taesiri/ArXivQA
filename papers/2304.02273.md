# [MMVC: Learned Multi-Mode Video Compression with Block-based Prediction   Mode Selection and Density-Adaptive Entropy Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02273)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:

How can we develop an efficient video compression method that can adaptively select optimal prediction modes and entropy coding strategies on a block-level basis to improve compression performance across diverse video content? 

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a multi-mode video compression framework (MMVC) that selects among different prediction modes (convLSTM-based, optical flow-based, feature propagation) at the block level based on which yields the sparsest residual and shortest code length.

- Developing a density-adaptive entropy coding scheme that switches between dense and sparse coding paths for each block based on the residual density, using run-length coding for sparse blocks.

- Introducing a block-wise channel pruning method to remove less important channels from the residuals to improve sparsity without much quality loss.

- Demonstrating competitive or superior RD performance compared to state-of-the-art learned video compression methods and standard codecs like HEVC and VVC.

In essence, the central hypothesis appears to be that adaptively selecting prediction modes and entropy coding strategies tailored to each block's specific content can improve compression efficiency compared to using a single universal approach. The results seem to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a multi-mode video compression framework (MMVC) that adaptively selects between different prediction modes on a block-level basis to address different motion patterns. The prediction modes include:

- Skip mode for static regions
- Optical flow conditioned feature prediction for regions with smooth motion 
- Feature propagation for changed regions with no better alternative
- Feature prediction with ConvLSTM for generic cases

2. Introducing a block-wise channel removal technique to remove unimportant residual channels and improve compression.

3. Using a density-adaptive entropy coding scheme with optional run-length coding for sparse residual blocks, guided by a binary density map. This provides significant bitrate savings compared to dense entropy coding of all blocks.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that MMVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance compared to prior learned video compression methods and standard video codecs like HEVC and AVC.

In summary, the key ideas are block-level mode selection for motion-adaptive prediction, channel removal and density-adaptive entropy coding for improved compression, and extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance. The adaptivity to different motion patterns and efficient handling of residuals are the main strengths of this approach.
