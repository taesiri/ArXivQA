# [MMVC: Learned Multi-Mode Video Compression with Block-based Prediction   Mode Selection and Density-Adaptive Entropy Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02273)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question/hypothesis appears to be:

How can we develop an efficient video compression method that can adaptively select optimal prediction modes and entropy coding strategies on a block-level basis to improve compression performance across diverse video content? 

The key ideas and contributions seem to be:

- Proposing a multi-mode video compression framework (MMVC) that selects among different prediction modes (convLSTM-based, optical flow-based, feature propagation) at the block level based on which yields the sparsest residual and shortest code length.

- Developing a density-adaptive entropy coding scheme that switches between dense and sparse coding paths for each block based on the residual density, using run-length coding for sparse blocks.

- Introducing a block-wise channel pruning method to remove less important channels from the residuals to improve sparsity without much quality loss.

- Demonstrating competitive or superior RD performance compared to state-of-the-art learned video compression methods and standard codecs like HEVC and VVC.

In essence, the central hypothesis appears to be that adaptively selecting prediction modes and entropy coding strategies tailored to each block's specific content can improve compression efficiency compared to using a single universal approach. The results seem to validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a multi-mode video compression framework (MMVC) that adaptively selects between different prediction modes on a block-level basis to address different motion patterns. The prediction modes include:

- Skip mode for static regions
- Optical flow conditioned feature prediction for regions with smooth motion 
- Feature propagation for changed regions with no better alternative
- Feature prediction with ConvLSTM for generic cases

2. Introducing a block-wise channel removal technique to remove unimportant residual channels and improve compression.

3. Using a density-adaptive entropy coding scheme with optional run-length coding for sparse residual blocks, guided by a binary density map. This provides significant bitrate savings compared to dense entropy coding of all blocks.

4. Demonstrating through experiments that MMVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance compared to prior learned video compression methods and standard video codecs like HEVC and AVC.

In summary, the key ideas are block-level mode selection for motion-adaptive prediction, channel removal and density-adaptive entropy coding for improved compression, and extensive experiments showing state-of-the-art performance. The adaptivity to different motion patterns and efficient handling of residuals are the main strengths of this approach.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a deep learning based video compression method called MMVC that adaptively selects between different inter-frame prediction modes on a per-block basis and uses a density-adaptive entropy coder to further compress the prediction residuals.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of learned video compression:

- The key innovation is the multi-mode prediction framework that adapts prediction strategies on a per-block basis. Other methods typically use a single prediction model applied uniformly across the frame. Enabling multiple prediction modes customized for each block's content is a novel idea. 

- The proposed multi-mode prediction allows handling a wide variety of motion types, from static scenes to complex dynamic motions. Many other learned video compression works focus on a certain type of motion, but have limitations generalizing to diverse contents.

- Using block-based processing for mode selection and channel removal is also an impactful contribution. Prior arts apply operations uniformly across the entire frame. The block-based approach allows better adaptation and customization leading to gains in compression efficiency.

- The dual-mode entropy coding conditioned on residual density is another major contribution not explored before. It effectively converts sparser residuals from the multi-mode prediction to substantial bitrate reductions.

- Overall compression performance is competitive or better than recent state-of-the-art learned video codecs like DVC, DCVC, VCT, etc. as well as standard codecs like HEVC and VVC. 

- The ablation studies provide useful insights into when and why each mode is more effective depending on motion characteristics. This analysis helps understand the complementarity of different prediction modes.

In summary, the block-based multi-mode prediction framework combined with the density-adaptive entropy coding provides novel contributions over prior arts. The gains in rate-distortion performance are clearly demonstrated through comparisons and ablation studies. The ideas proposed have strong potential for practical impact in video compression.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Explore other prediction modes that can capture additional motion patterns beyond the ones evaluated in this work. The authors mention that incorporating more modes in the prediction ensemble can potentially lead to further performance improvements.

- Investigate more advanced optical flow algorithms to provide better motion estimation as the condition for the OFC prediction mode. This could improve the accuracy of OFC predictions. 

- Study adaptive block size selection instead of fixed block partitioning to better capture localized motion differences. Using larger blocks for smooth motions and smaller blocks near edges can be more efficient.

- Extend the framework to also leverage inter-frame latent feature correlations and redundancies beyond just the prediction residual. For example, explore conditional entropy models for latent features.

- Evaluate the performance on higher resolution videos beyond 1080p tested in this work. Additional experimentation is needed to adapt the models and validate gains at higher resolutions.

- Explore the trade-offs between multiple prediction modes and skipping inVariable Block Size (VBS) settings. VBS mode partitioning can provide more flexibility.

- Enhance the rate control mechanism for smoother quality transitions across bitrates and clips with different motion characteristics.

- Quantify gains for perceptual quality metrics beyond PSNR and MS-SSIM used in this work. Study quality improvements for human perception.

In summary, the authors point out several promising directions to further improve compression efficiency, adaptivity, and perceptual quality by enhancing the prediction ensemble, partitioning flexibility, and rate control aspects of the overall framework. More advanced optical flow and entropy estimation methods are also suggested as potential areas of improvement.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-mode video compression (MMVC) framework that adaptively selects the optimal prediction mode for each block to address a wide range of motion patterns. The proposed modes include ConvLSTM-based feature prediction, optical flow conditioned feature prediction, feature propagation, and skip mode. Blocks are predicted in the feature domain and the residuals are obtained by subtracting the predicted features from the optimal features extracted from the original frame. To further improve compression, a channel removal technique masks out unimportant residual channels based on reconstruction quality impact. The paper also presents a density-aware entropy coding scheme that applies run-length coding to sparse residuals and conventional entropy coding to dense residuals. Evaluations on benchmark datasets show the proposed method achieves better rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art learned video compression methods and standard codecs like HEVC, AVC, and VVC. The ablation studies demonstrate the complementary nature of the prediction modes and the bitrate reductions from channel removal and density-adaptive entropy coding.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-mode video compression (MMVC) framework that adaptively selects the optimal prediction mode on a block level to efficiently compress video sequences with varying motion patterns. The proposed framework consists of four prediction modes: Skip mode for unchanged blocks, optical flow conditioned feature prediction for blocks with smooth motion, feature propagation for changed but hard to predict blocks, and a ConvLSTM-based feature prediction mode for other generic cases. By evaluating these prediction modes in the feature domain at the block level and selecting the one with the most compact residual representation to encode, the method adapts to local spatial-temporal correlation and motion characteristics. The paper also introduces techniques including learned channel pruning and density-adaptive entropy coding to further improve compression efficiency. 

The method is evaluated on standard test datasets and shows competitive or better rate-distortion performance compared to the state-of-the-art learned video codecs and standard video codecs like HEVC and VVC. The ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of different components and the complementarity of various prediction modes. The mode distribution analysis on different types of videos reveals that the method dynamically adjusts the mode utilization based on the video content. Overall, the work presents an effective and efficient video compression framework by exploiting block-based mode adaptation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a multi-mode video compression (MMVC) framework that adaptively selects different prediction modes on a per-block basis to address varying motion patterns within a frame. It consists of four main prediction modes: Skip mode for static blocks, optical flow conditioned feature prediction for blocks with apparent motion, feature propagation for changed but hard to predict blocks, and ConvLSTM-based inter-frame feature prediction for other generic cases. Residual blocks from different prediction modes are evaluated by their resulting entropy after quantization and entropy coding, and the optimal mode with the shortest code length is selected. To further improve compression, a channel removal technique is applied to mask out non-critical residual channels. The residuals are also processed by a density-adaptive entropy coder that switches between dense and sparse coding paths based on the sparsity of each block. Experiments show superior rate-distortion performance compared to state-of-the-art learned video compression methods and standard codecs like HEVC and VVC. The scheme benefits from selecting the best mode adaptively according to the content variations.
