# [Errors are Useful Prompts: Instruction Guided Task Programming with   Verifier-Assisted Iterative Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14100)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:

How can we develop a method to translate natural language instructions into executable robot task plans, especially for domain-specific languages with scarce training data?

The key hypotheses tested in this work seem to be:

1) Automated iterative prompting between a generator (large language model) and a verifier can improve the success rate of generating valid structured task plans from natural language, particularly for unfamiliar domain-specific languages. 

2) The quality of the task plans generated by the proposed method (\ourmodel) will be better than existing baseline methods, as evaluated by expert comparisons.

3) The task plans generated by \ourmodel can be successfully executed by a real robot when integrated with a task and motion planning framework, demonstrating the feasibility of translating natural language instructions to robotic actions.

To summarize, the central research question focuses on developing a technique to translate natural language to executable robot plans for domain-specific languages, using iterative prompting and verification to handle data scarcity issues. The key hypotheses examine whether this approach can improve plan generation success, quality compared to baselines, and real-world feasibility when executed by a robot. The experiments and results provide evidence to support these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a novel framework called CLAIRify to generate structured task plans for domain-specific languages using natural language instructions. The key aspects of their contribution are:

1. They propose combining a large language model (LLM) based generator with a rule-based verifier in an iterative loop to generate syntactically valid programs in unfamiliar domain-specific languages (DSLs). 

2. The LLM generator leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs by providing a description of the target DSL as part of the prompt. This allows generating structured outputs for unfamiliar DSLs in a zero-shot manner.

3. The rule-based verifier checks the output of the LLM generator for syntactic correctness based on the rules of the DSL. It provides feedback on any errors back to the generator to correct errors in the next iteration. 

4. This iterative prompting between generator and verifier ensures the final output adheres to the syntax of the target DSL.

5. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed framework CLAIRify on generating plans in a chemistry DSL called XDL. It outperforms prior XDL generation methods.

6. They show the generated XDL plans can be executed on a real robot by integrating them with a task and motion planning framework.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing an iterative prompting technique between an LLM generator and rule-based verifier to generate syntactically valid programs in unfamiliar DSLs from natural language in a zero-shot manner. The effectiveness is demonstrated for chemistry experiment planning.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The paper introduces a new method called CLAIRify that combines iterative prompting of a large language model with a verifier to generate structured task plans from natural language instructions. This approach of iterative prompting between a generator and verifier is novel compared to other methods that rely solely on large language models or other techniques.

- The paper demonstrates CLAIRify on the task of generating plans in the chemistry domain, specifically using the Chemical Description Language (XDL). Most prior work has focused on generating programs or plans in more common languages like Python. Applying these techniques to domain-specific languages with less training data is an important contribution.

- The paper shows CLAIRify can outperform prior XDL generation methods like SynthReader that use rule-based approaches. This helps demonstrate the power of iterative prompting with large language models compared to hand-crafted rules and patterns.

- The paper integrates the generated XDL plans with a real robot system using a task and motion planning framework. Testing the plans on a physical system is a key validation step not present in much related work. 

- The idea of using a verifier to constrain and validate the outputs of a large language model aligns with other recent work like LEVER and Toolformer. However, CLAIRify's application to structured task planning and real-world robotics experiments helps advance research in this direction.

Overall, the paper introduces a novel technique for structured task planning that combines the benefits of large language models and verifiers. The chemistry domain experiments and real robot demonstrations help validate the method in ways lacking in much prior work. The results suggest iterative prompting is a promising approach for generating executable plans from natural language.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing more advanced perceptual modules to provide feedback during task plan generation and execution. The authors suggest incorporating visual, tactile, and other sensory feedback to improve the grounding of the generated plans and handle ambiguous instructions.

- Encoding more domain knowledge into the verifier component to catch common errors and inconsistencies. For example, incorporating constraints on allowable hardware configurations and state changes to avoid physically impossible plans.

- Reducing the size and complexity of the structured language description provided to the generator. This would enable generating longer and more complex plans. Approaches could include learning an abstracted version of the language or interactive prompting during generation.

- Evaluating the approach on more complex real-world tasks and datasets beyond basic chemistry experiments. This includes testing scalability and adapting the framework to new domains like robotics, programming languages, etc.

- Exploring alternate generator architectures beyond the GPT-3 model used. This includes trying different prompting techniques for iterative improvement and comparing transformer, LSTM, and neuro-symbolic approaches.

- Integrating uncertainty handling and error recovery during plan execution. This would make the overall system more robust when deployed in messy real-world environments.

- Tightening the integration of the high-level task planner with the low-level robot motion planner. The framework could be end-to-end differentiable to enable joint optimization and improve the coordinated behavior.

In summary, the authors propose enhancing the perceptual grounding, knowledge representation, scaling capability, architecture exploration, execution monitoring, and motion planning integration as promising directions for improving instruction-guided task programming.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel approach called CLAIRify that combines automatic iterative prompting with program verification to translate natural language instructions into executable robot task plans, even for domain-specific languages with limited training data. CLAIRify uses a large language model to generate candidate structured task plans from prompts containing the natural language instruction and domain language rules. It then passes the output through a verifier that checks for syntactic and environment constraint errors. Any errors are fed back into the language model prompt to correct the next iteration. This iterative interaction between the generator and verifier leads to grounded, syntactically valid task plans. The authors demonstrate CLAIRify's effectiveness at generating plans for chemistry experiments in the new XML-based language XDL. Evaluations show it outperforms prior XDL generation methods, and the generated plans can be executed by combining them with an integrated task and motion planning framework on a real robot. The key innovations are the iterative prompting approach to improve zero-shot task plan generation and the integration of a verifier to ensure syntactic correctness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel framework called CLAIRify that translates natural language instructions into executable robot task plans. The key idea is to combine a large language model that generates structured task plans with a verifier that iteratively checks these plans for syntactic correctness. 

Specifically, the language model is prompted with the natural language instruction as well as the syntax rules of the target structured language. It then generates an initial structured plan. This plan is passed to the verifier which checks for syntactic errors and violations of environment constraints. Any errors are fed back to the language model to generate an improved plan in the next iteration. This loop continues until a valid plan is obtained or a timeout is reached. The final verified plan can then be executed by integrating it with a task and motion planner on a real robot. The authors demonstrate the approach on generating plans in an XML-based language called XDL for specifying chemistry experiments. Evaluations show the method outperforms prior baselines in generating valid XDL plans. The plans are also successfully executed on a robot performing simple chemistry tasks like mixing solutions. Key strengths are the iterative prompting approach to handle unfamiliar structured languages and integration of syntactic checking to enable robotic plan execution.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a framework called CLAIRify that translates natural language instructions into executable robot task plans in a domain-specific language (DSL). It uses an iterative interaction between a generator module based on a large language model (LLM) and a rule-based verifier module. The generator takes as input the natural language instruction along with a description of the target DSL and attempts to generate a task plan. This output is passed to the verifier which checks for syntactic and semantic validity according to the DSL specifications. Any errors are passed back to the generator to fix in the next iteration. This loop continues until a valid plan is generated or a timeout is reached. The key aspects are the use of an LLM for generation to leverage natural language abilities and few-shot generalization, the rule-based verifier to ensure output correctness, and the iterative prompting framework to guide the open-ended LLM towards valid structured outputs through verification feedback. The method is demonstrated on generating plans in a chemistry DSL called XDL and integrated with a robotic task planning framework for execution.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main problem the authors are trying to address is how to generate low-level robot task plans from high-level natural language instructions. Specifically, the paper discusses two main challenges:

1. Lack of task plan verification: Large language models can generate robot task plans from natural language prompts, but these plans often cannot be directly executed by robots due to not adhering to strict syntax rules or not accounting for the current environment/robot capabilities.

2. Poor performance on data-scarce domain-specific languages: Large language models perform well on commonly used programming languages with lots of training data, but struggle to generate plans in domain-specific languages like those used in chemistry/physics where training data is scarce.

To address these challenges, the authors propose an approach called CLAIRify which combines automatic iterative prompting of a large language model with program verification using a rule-based verifier. The verifier checks for syntax errors and constraints, providing feedback to the language model to iteratively improve the generated plan. This allows low-level robot task plans to be created from high-level instructions even for unfamiliar domain-specific languages.

In summary, the key problem is enabling robots to take high-level natural language instructions and convert them into executable low-level task plans, even for domain-specific languages without much training data, while also verifying the plans are syntactically valid and account for real-world constraints. The authors' proposed approach of iterative prompting with a verifier aims to bridge this gap.
