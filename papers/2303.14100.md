# Errors are Useful Prompts: Instruction Guided Task Programming with
  Verifier-Assisted Iterative Prompting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be:How can we develop a method to translate natural language instructions into executable robot task plans, especially for domain-specific languages with scarce training data?The key hypotheses tested in this work seem to be:1) Automated iterative prompting between a generator (large language model) and a verifier can improve the success rate of generating valid structured task plans from natural language, particularly for unfamiliar domain-specific languages. 2) The quality of the task plans generated by the proposed method (\ourmodel) will be better than existing baseline methods, as evaluated by expert comparisons.3) The task plans generated by \ourmodel can be successfully executed by a real robot when integrated with a task and motion planning framework, demonstrating the feasibility of translating natural language instructions to robotic actions.To summarize, the central research question focuses on developing a technique to translate natural language to executable robot plans for domain-specific languages, using iterative prompting and verification to handle data scarcity issues. The key hypotheses examine whether this approach can improve plan generation success, quality compared to baselines, and real-world feasibility when executed by a robot. The experiments and results provide evidence to support these hypotheses.
