# [ArcMMLU: A Library and Information Science Benchmark for Large Language   Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18658)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces ArcMMLU, a new Chinese benchmark for evaluating large language models' capabilities specifically within the library and information science (LIS) domain. ArcMMLU covers over 6,000 expert-curated, real-world questions across four key LIS subareas: archival science, data science, library science, and information science. Following a meticulous data collection and verification process, the authors evaluate mainstream Chinese LLMs on ArcMMLU in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. The results reveal current models still have substantial room for improvement in the LIS domain, with an average accuracy above 50% but a clear gap compared to top performers like GPT-4 (75.08% accuracy). Further analysis on the impact of few-shot examples and common errors exposes deficiencies in domain knowledge and reasoning abilities. Overall, ArcMMLU fills a critical void for LIS-focused LLM assessment and provides valuable insights to guide the development of models better suited for this specialized domain's unique challenges.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces ArcMMLU, a new Chinese benchmark tailored for evaluating large language models' capabilities in the library and information science domain, covering over 6,000 questions across archival science, data science, library science, and information science.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contributions are summarized in the introduction:

1. They construct a comprehensive LIS-domain-focused LLM evaluation benchmark, ArcMMLU, which covers four key subdomains with over 6,000 high-quality real-world questions.

2. They evaluate the mainstream LLMs on ArcMMLU and the results reflect the current models' capabilities and limitations across different subdomains. 

3. They conduct further analysis to identify critical areas for potential improvement, providing insights for future LLM development in LIS domain.

In summary, the key contribution is developing a specialized benchmark for the Library & Information Science domain to evaluate LLMs, assessing current models, and providing analysis to guide future improvements in this domain. The benchmark fills a gap for LLM evaluation in the LIS field.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- ArcMMLU - The name of the specialized benchmark introduced in the paper for evaluating large language models in the Library & Information Science domain.

- Library & Information Science (LIS) - The domain that ArcMMLU focuses on, covering areas like Archival Science, Data Science, Library Science, and Information Science. 

- Large Language Models (LLMs) - The models that ArcMMLU aims to evaluate, including the capabilities of models like GPT-4.

- Evaluation benchmark - ArcMMLU serves as a specialized evaluation platform to test LLMs' capabilities within the LIS domain.

- Single-choice questions - The format of examples in ArcMMLU, with one correct answer out of four options.  

- Model analysis - The paper analyzes the performance of various mainstream LLMs on ArcMMLU to assess their strengths and limitations.

- Error analysis - Further analysis in the paper focusing on challenging questions that models consistently get wrong to reveal areas for improvement.

- Few-shot learning - Exploring the impact of providing models a few examples before testing questions.

So in summary, key terms cover ArcMMLU itself, the LIS domain focus, LLMs, evaluation, analysis, question format, and few-shot learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does ArcMMLU address the gap in existing LLM evaluation benchmarks for the Library & Information Science (LIS) domain, especially in Chinese? What unique aspects of the LIS field does it capture that more general benchmarks may miss?

2. What was the overall construction workflow and data sourcing strategy used to build the ArcMMLU benchmark? How much manual effort was involved and what were some key steps like cleaning, filtering, annotation etc.? 

3. The paper evaluates ArcMMLU performance across 4 subdomains - Archival Science, Data Science, Library Science and Information Science. Why were these 4 areas chosen as key pillars of the LIS field? What differences did models exhibit in their capabilities across these areas?

4. When analyzing model performance with few-shot examples, some models like ChatGLM-6B showed declining accuracy. What are two potential reasons explored in the paper that could explain this unexpected behavior?

5. For the "ArcMMLU-Hard" subset where all open-source models failed, what was GPT-4's overall accuracy? Which subdomain did it perform best and worst on this challenging set? 

6. From the error analysis, what appear to be two critical limitations highlighted in existing LLMs when looking at questions they still fail on ArcMMLU-Hard?

7. How suitable is GPT-4's architecture for addressing LIS domain needs compared to Chinese models? What enhancements could further improve capabilities?

8. What specific strategies does the paper suggest to improve model performance in the Archival Science and Information Science subdomains? Why did models struggle more here?

9. How useful were few-shot examples for models like XVERSE-13B? Did performance correlate positively with more few-shot examples for most models?

10. For future Chinese LLM development, what are some priority areas the analysis indicates could have high impact in better addressing LIS domain needs?
