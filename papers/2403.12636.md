# [A Practical Guide to Statistical Distances for Evaluating Generative   Models in Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12636)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Generative models are being increasingly used across scientific disciplines to model complex, high-dimensional data distributions such as images, text, time series data, etc.  
- However, evaluating how accurately these models mimic the true underlying data distribution is challenging, especially for implicit models that don't allow direct likelihood evaluation.
- There is a need for solid quantitative evaluation approaches to compare and benchmark different generative models.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper provides an accessible introduction to four commonly used sample-based statistical distances for evaluating generative models:
   1. Sliced Wasserstein (SW) Distance: Projects distributions onto random 1D subspaces and computes Wasserstein distance between the resulting 1D distributions. Computationally efficient.
   2. Classifier Two-Sample Test (C2ST): Trains a classifier to discriminate between samples from the two distributions and uses its accuracy as the distance. Interpretable but can be expensive to compute.
   3. Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD): Implicitly maps distributions to a feature space using kernels and compares distributions using their mean feature representations. Flexible but sensitive to kernel selection.
   4. Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID): Uses a pretrained neural net (Inception) to explicitly embed image samples before comparing distributions. Captures perceptual similarity but relies on network.

- The paper explains the intuition behind each distance, highlights their merits and limitations, and evaluates their robustness to factors like sample size and dimensionality.

Key Contributions:
- Provides very accessible explanations and figures to build intuition about the statistical distances.
- Systematically analyzes robustness of distances as a function of sample size, dimensionality, etc. 
- Demonstrates application of distances for comparing generative models from two different scientific domains.
- Showcases the importance of using multiple complementary distances, as different distances can lead to different conclusions.
- Overall, helps researchers choose, implement and evaluate statistical distances for evaluating generative models.

In summary, the paper serves as an excellent practical guide to understand commonly used statistical distances for evaluating generative models in science. It empowers researchers to effectively benchmark models by using these distances.
