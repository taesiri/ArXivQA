# [Contrastive News and Social Media Linking using BERT for Articles and   Tweets across Dual Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07599)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Linking tweets to related news articles is challenging due to the informal, concise nature of tweets compared to more formal news content. This linkage could enable monitoring of public discourse around events.
- Prior approaches using topic models, graph-based models, and classifiers have limitations in effectively capturing the characteristics of tweets and news.

Proposed Solution:
- Inspired by contrastive learning from computer vision (CLIP), the authors propose a contrastive learning approach called CATBERT to train a joint embedding space for tweets and news where proximity indicates semantic similarity.
- CATBERT uses separate BERT-based encoder networks for tweets and articles to capture their unique characteristics. It brings representations of matching tweet-article pairs closer together while pushing non-matching pairs apart.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of new manually labeled datasets linking Polish and English tweets to news articles related to the Ukraine war, to serve as a benchmark.
- Introduction of CATBERT contrastive learning method for linking tweets and news showing superior performance over LDA, TF-IDF and OpenAI embeddings on a Polish dataset.
- Analysis of model performance on linking entire tweet cascades to news, finding simple tweet aggregation approaches ineffective while OpenAI embeddings show some promise.
- Demonstration of the first use of neural networks for linking tweets to news, opening up further exploration of deep learning approaches.

The models and datasets are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction. Overall, the work introduces a new contrastive learning paradigm for associating informal social media content with formal news reporting.
