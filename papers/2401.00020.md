# [AI-driven platform for systematic nomenclature and intelligent knowledge   acquisition of natural medicinal materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00020)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- The field of natural medicinal materials (NMMs) faces major challenges due to the non-standardization of NMM knowledge, including ambiguities in identifying NMM species origins and difficulties acquiring precise NMM information. This hinders research progress and broader applications.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a Systematic Nomenclature for NMMs to enable precise NMM identification and differentiation. This includes assigning each NMM a globally unique Systematic Name, Generic Name and NMM ID.
- They also develop ShennongAlpha, an AI-driven platform for intelligent, standardized acquisition of NMM knowledge. It contains a knowledge base with over 10,000 systematically named NMM entries and features like ShennongChat for conversational knowledge retrieval and ShennongTranslate for interpretable machine translation.

Main Contributions:
- Pioneering Systematic Nomenclature, algorithm and online application for unambiguous NMM identification, overcoming limitations caused by ambiguous naming.
- Developing ShennongAlpha as the first platform enabling deep integration of advanced AI for intelligent NMM knowledge acquisition, including innovations like conversational search and standardized translation.
- ShennongAlpha knowledge base systematically catalogs over 10,000 NMM entries from authoritative sources, enhancing reliability.
- Proposed architecture combining knowledge base, search engine and large language models provides template for building specialized AI knowledge platforms in other domains.
- Overall, the advances propel progress in both NMM and AI research through their synergistic integration, accelerating future discoveries.

In summary, this transformative work introduces systematic naming and an AI knowledge platform to overcome challenges in acquiring reliable, precise NMM information, enabling accelerated progress.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a Systematic Nomenclature for standardizing the identification of Natural Medicinal Materials, presents ShennongAlpha as an AI-powered platform for intelligent acquisition of this standardized knowledge, and demonstrates innovative applications like conversational queries and machine translation within this specialized domain.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two major contributions:

1. It introduces a Systematic Nomenclature for Natural Medicinal Materials (NMMs) to standardize the naming and identification of NMMs. This includes defining rules for systematic names, generic names, and ID codes for NMMs to avoid ambiguity.

2. It presents ShennongAlpha, an AI-powered platform for intelligently acquiring and managing standardized knowledge about NMMs. ShennongAlpha integrates an NMM knowledge base with features like a search engine, conversational system (ShennongChat), and translation system (ShennongTranslate) to enhance accessibility and globalization of NMM knowledge.

In summary, the paper pioneers the integration of AI with the NMM field to propel advancements, while also establishing a standardized nomenclature system as a cornerstone for NMM research and applications.
