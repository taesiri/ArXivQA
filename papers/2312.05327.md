# [Data-Centric Machine Learning for Geospatial Remote Sensing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05327)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- There is an overemphasis on model-centric machine learning, focusing primarily on model design and evaluation on static benchmark datasets, rather than considering the full machine learning pipeline.  
- Real-world applications require robustness across the pipeline, including data acquisition, curation, training, evaluation, and deployment.
- There needs to be a shift towards data-centric learning that focuses more on the data itself - improving data quality according to relevant criteria and utilizing the data more effectively.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper provides a systematic categorization and literature review of data-centric techniques for geospatial data across the entire machine learning pipeline.
- Five key data quality criteria are identified as relevant for geospatial data: diversity, accuracy, consistency, unbiasedness, and relevance.
- Data-centric techniques are structured into how they act on or use these quality criteria at different stages: data creation, curation, model training, evaluation, and deployment. 
- Gaps are identified in research on automated data creation for consistency/unbiasedness/relevance and data curation for diversity/consistency/unbiasedness.

Main Contributions:
- Precise definition and taxonomy of data-centric learning and its role in the machine learning cycle
- Identification of 5 key data quality criteria for geospatial data  
- Extensive literature review and categorization of data-centric techniques tailored to geospatial data
- Demonstration experiments showing concrete implementations of data-centric methods 
- Identification of research gaps in data-centric techniques, especially in early pipeline stages  

The paper makes a strong case for the need to shift focus towards data-centric learning to achieve accurate and robust real-world geospatial ML applications. It provides researchers with precise terminology, quality criteria, and an extensive literature base to build impactful solutions.
