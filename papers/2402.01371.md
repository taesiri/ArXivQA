# [Critic-Actor for Average Reward MDPs with Function Approximation: A   Finite-Time Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01371)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Actor-critic methods are effective for reinforcement learning but require a two-timescale update where the actor updates slower than the critic. This mimics policy iteration.
- Recently, a "critic-actor" method was proposed where the timescales are reversed - the critic updates slower than the actor. This was shown to have asymptotic convergence and track value iteration instead of policy iteration. 

- However, prior critic-actor work was only for the lookup table case with discounted infinite horizon cost. This paper aims to develop and analyze the first critic-actor method with function approximation and for the average reward setting.

Method:
- Proposes a two-timescale critic-actor algorithm with linear function approximation for the critic and average reward formulation. 
- Critic updates are on the slower timescale using temporal difference learning. Actor updates are on the faster timescale using stochastic gradient ascent.
- Average reward updates are on the same faster timescale as the actor. 

Main Contributions:

- First critic-actor algorithm for average reward problems with function approximation
- Finite time analysis providing non-asymptotic convergence rates 
- Better sample complexity than prior actor-critic methods: Õ(ε^{-2.08}) vs Õ(ε^−2.5))
- Optimal learning rates derived for actor, critic and average reward
- Experiments on 3 benchmark environments showing critic-actor competitive and better than actor-critic and other baselines on 2 settings

In summary, the paper develops the first critic-actor method for average reward RL with function approximation, proves finite time bounds, derives optimal rates, and shows strong experimental performance versus actor-critic and other baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents the first critic-actor algorithm with linear function approximation for the long-run average reward criterion, provides a finite-time analysis of the algorithm, and shows it achieves a sample complexity of Õ(ε^−2.08) for bounding the critic's mean squared error by ε.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It presents the first critic-actor algorithm with linear function approximation for the long-run average-reward reinforcement learning setting. Prior work on critic-actor algorithms was limited to the lookup table case and discounted reward setting. 

2) It provides a detailed non-asymptotic (finite-time) analysis of this critic-actor algorithm and establishes bounds on the critic error, actor error, and average reward estimate error. Importantly, it obtains a sample complexity of Õ(ε^-2.08) for the critic mean squared error to be bounded by ε. 

3) This sample complexity improves upon the Õ(ε^-2.5) sample complexity of prior two-timescale actor-critic algorithms in the average reward setting. Thus this paper shows both theoretically and empirically that critic-actor can outperform actor-critic.

4) It shows experimental results comparing critic-actor against actor-critic and other baselines on 3 OpenAI Gym environments. The results demonstrate critic-actor is competitive and in fact outperforms the algorithms on 2 of the 3 environments.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting the first critic-actor algorithm for average reward RL with function approximation, providing finite-time analysis and sample complexity bounds, and demonstrating strong empirical performance against actor-critic and other baselines.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the critic-actor algorithm and analysis proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a critic-actor algorithm for the average reward setting with linear function approximation. How does the algorithm differ from traditional actor-critic methods, especially in terms of the timescales? What is the intuition behind reversing the roles of the actor and critic?

2. A key theoretical result is the finite-time analysis and the derived sample complexity bound. Walk through the key steps in the proofs of convergence for the actor, critic, and average reward estimator. What are the key challenges handled compared to prior analyses of actor-critic algorithms?  

3. The sample complexity obtained is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2.08})$. Compare this with prior actor-critic algorithms analyzed under similar settings. Why is the critic-actor algorithm able to achieve better dependence on $\epsilon$? What aspects of the algorithm design and analysis contribute to this?

4. Assumption 4 in the paper requires the policy to be smooth with respect to the policy parameters. Walk through why this assumption is required in the proofs. What would happen if this assumption were relaxed or removed entirely? 

5. The actor and critic updates couple with each other in intricate ways, as discussed in Figure 1. Explain how the analysis accounts for these interdependencies. Why can't the actor and critic errors be analyzed completely independently?

6. The critic employs linear function approximation. Discuss the challenges that would arise in extending the finite-time analysis to nonlinear function approximators. What new mathematical tools might be required?

7. The experiments demonstrate strong performance against actor-critic baselines. Speculate on why critic-actor might have advantages. Does the fact it emulates value iteration provide intuition? How could the experimental evaluation be strengthened?

8. The current analysis focuses entirely on the tabular average reward setting. Discuss challenges and open questions in extending critic-actor to other settings like discounted reward, continuous spaces, offline RL, etc. 

9. The paper argues critic-actor is an under-studied direction. What other possibilities exist for reversing or altering traditional timescales or roles in reinforcement learning algorithms that may merit further analysis?

10. How might the critic-actor concept extend to related fields like dynamic programming or optimal control? Could the idea of reversing faster/slower processes lead to new algorithms or analyses in other settings beyond RL?
