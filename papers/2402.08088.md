# [Out-of-Distribution Detection and Data Drift Monitoring using   Statistical Process Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08088)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Machine learning models often fail when exposed to data that differs from their training distribution. This is concerning for healthcare applications as input data can drift over time, leading to unpredictable and potentially unsafe model performance. Therefore, methods are needed to detect out-of-distribution inputs and monitor data drift.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a framework that combines machine learning with statistical process control (SPC) techniques for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and drift monitoring. SPC tools like control charts visually highlight deviations from an expected data distribution. To implement SPC, appropriate features must first be extracted using machine learning models. Then, distance metrics quantify the similarity of test inputs to the training data in feature space. Inputs exceeding set control limits are flagged as OOD. 

For individual input monitoring, the 3sigma rule effectively identified OOD images. For temporally batched inputs, Cumulative Sum Control Charts (CUSUM) rapidly detected subtle distribution shifts over time. The framework is flexible to different features, datasets and tasks. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in two medical imaging applications: 1) Detecting non-axial CT slice orientations 2) Identifying non-CXR and pediatric CXR images.

Main Contributions:
- A novel framework combining ML and SPC for OOD detection and drift monitoring
- Demonstration that SPC-based monitoring requires careful selection of features and metrics 
- Analysis showing CUSUM detects batched input drift whereas 3sigma identifies image-level OODs
- Results highlighting the framework's flexibility across features, datasets and tasks
- Practical implementation addressing the real-world issue of data mislabeling and drift in medical imaging

The proposed framework offers an adaptive, data-driven approach to flag deviations from expected distributions over time. This has implications for improving model safety and determining when re-training is warranted in clinical deployments.
