# [LaMPilot: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Autonomous Driving with Language   Model Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04372)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces LaMPilot, a new benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow driving instructions and generate executable vehicle control policies. The benchmark includes a driving simulator, a dataset of 4,900 human-annotated driving scenarios with natural language instructions, and an evaluation protocol. Each sample contains the instruction, initial state, and goal state criteria. The framework allows LLMs to leverage API functions covering key driving primitives to plan actions. Experiments are conducted with various state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot, and human-in-the-loop settings. The results demonstrate that with human feedback, GPT-4 achieved impressive performance, with a 92.7% task completion rate and 0.9% collision rate. This highlights the potential of LLMs for translating instructions into strategic driving actions through code generation. The benchmark and framework pave the way for further research into integrating language abilities of LLMs for more efficient and safer autonomous driving systems.
