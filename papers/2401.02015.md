# [Improving Diffusion-Based Image Synthesis with Context Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02015)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing diffusion models for image generation mainly focus on point-wise reconstruction along the spatial axes to recover the entire image. This neglects to fully preserve the local context and semantic distribution of each predicted pixel/feature, which may impair the fidelity of generated images. 

Proposed Solution (ConPreDiff):
The paper proposes ConPreDiff to improve diffusion-based image synthesis by incorporating context prediction. Specifically, ConPreDiff forces each pixel/feature/token to predict its local neighborhood context (i.e. multi-stride features/tokens/pixels) using an extra context decoder near the end of the diffusion denoising blocks during training. This explicit context prediction can preserve the semantic connections between a point and its neighborhood. 

In inference, the context decoder is removed so no extra parameters are introduced. ConPreDiff transforms the decoding target from entire neighborhood features to neighborhood distribution defined by a probability measure for efficiency. It then uses an optimal transport loss based on 2-Wasserstein distance to match the decoded distribution with the ground truth while ignoring their spatial order.

ConPreDiff can be integrated with both continuous and discrete diffusion models by substituting their original point-wise reconstruction loss with the proposed context prediction loss.

Main Contributions:

(1) Proposes ConPreDiff, which is the first technique to improve diffusion-based image generation by incorporating context prediction.

(2) Develops an efficient context decoding approach to represent neighborhood information as a probability distribution and match it with ground truth using optimal transport loss. 

(3) Achieves new SOTA results on unconditional generation, text-to-image generation, and image inpainting by enhancing existing diffusion models with ConPreDiff without introducing additional parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes ConPreDiff, a method that improves diffusion models for image generation by having each point predict its local neighborhood context using an efficient context decoder during training, while retaining the original diffusion model architecture during inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing ConPreDiff, a method to improve diffusion-based image synthesis by explicitly forcing each pixel/feature/token to predict its local neighborhood context. Specifically:

1) It proposes to add an extra context prediction term near the end of the diffusion denoising blocks during training, while removing this context decoder during inference so as not to introduce extra parameters. 

2) It represents the neighborhood context as a probability distribution and uses an optimal transport loss based on Wasserstein distance to impose structural similarity between the predicted and actual neighborhood distributions.

3) It shows ConPreDiff can generalize to both discrete and continuous diffusion models and consistently improve their performance across unconditional image generation, text-to-image generation, and image inpainting without needing extra parameters during inference.

4) It achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets like MS-COCO for text-to-image generation and CelebA-HQ for unconditional image generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting local context information to improve diffusion models.

In summary, the key innovation is using neighborhood context prediction to better preserve local semantic continuity and improve diffusion-based image synthesis.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Diffusion models - The paper focuses on improving diffusion models for image generation. Diffusion models are a class of generative models that add noise to data and then learn to reverse the process.

- Context prediction - The core contribution of the paper is a method called ConPreDiff that improves diffusion models by having them explicitly predict neighborhood context around each pixel/feature. This preserves local semantics.

- Discrete and continuous diffusion - The paper generalizes the context prediction approach to both discrete diffusion models that work with discrete tokens and continuous diffusion models that work in continuous latent spaces.

- Wasserstein distance - To efficiently decode neighborhood context distributions, the paper uses an optimal transport loss based on Wasserstein distance which measures distances between distributions.

- Unconditional generation - The method is evaluated on unconditional image generation tasks where the model generates images from noise.

- Text-to-image generation - The paper also shows results on text-to-image generation, where an image is generated to match a text description.

- Image inpainting - Another application that is evaluated is image inpainting, where missing regions of an image are filled in plausibly.

In summary, the key ideas focus around using context prediction to improve existing diffusion models for generative image modeling tasks. Both discrete and continuous diffusion model variants are addressed.
