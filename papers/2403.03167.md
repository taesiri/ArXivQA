# [PARADISE: Evaluating Implicit Planning Skills of Language Models with   Procedural Warnings and Tips Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03167)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing work on evaluating planning skills of language models uses simplified simulation environments lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity. 
- Current setups constrain evaluation methods, architectures tested, and overlook language nuances essential for real-world analysis.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper presents PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using question-answering format on practical procedural text from wikiHow. 
- It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly tied to goals, without intermediary steps, to test models' ability to infer implicit knowledge of the plan from the goal.
- Models are evaluated via fine-tuning on specialized tasks and zero-shot prompting of large LMs like GPT-4.

Key Contributions:
- Introduces robust baselines and analysis on an extensive expert-curated dataset covering diverse domains and implicit reasoning.
- Finds task-specific fine-tuning outperforms even large models like GPT-4, although all models lag behind humans.  
- Analysis reveals insights into keyword reliance, distinct failures between PLMs and LLMs, struggles with physical vs. abstract goals, and transfer learning gains.
- Proposes a new testbed to analyze open-domain planning abilities through abductive reasoning between goals and warnings/tips.

In summary, the paper presents PARADISE as a valuable resource and benchmark to evaluate the implicit planning skills of language models on practical yet challenging procedural texts. The analysis also provides interesting insights into current model capabilities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces PARADISE, a dataset and tasks for evaluating the implicit planning abilities of language models by having them infer warnings and tips solely from goals in procedural text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the presentation of PARADISE, an extensive expert-curated dataset for warning and tip inference tasks derived from wikiHow. PARADISE focuses on the implicit relationship between goals and warnings/tips, requiring models to possess implicit knowledge of intermediate steps solely based on the provided goal. The paper also establishes strong baselines by fine-tuning pretrained language models and zero-shot prompting of large language models on PARADISE. Additionally, the paper conducts extensive experiments and analysis to evaluate the reasoning and planning abilities of language models, revealing that task-specific small models generally outperform large language models and that there is still room for improvement compared to human performance.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key terms and topics associated with this paper include:

- PARADISE - The name of the dataset presented in the paper for evaluating implicit planning skills of language models. Stands for "Procedural And Reasoning Dataset for Implicit Skills Evaluation".

- Abductive reasoning - A type of reasoning focused on inferring missing information. The tasks in PARADISE involve abductive reasoning by testing the ability of models to infer implicit warnings and tips solely from a provided goal.  

- Procedural text - The text containing instructions/steps to achieve a goal. PARADISE uses procedural text from wikiHow tutorials.

- Warning and tip inference - The two specific task formulations that models are evaluated on in PARADISE. The models have to select the correct warning or tip associated with a provided goal.

- Implicit knowledge - Knowledge not directly stated but implied. A key aspect tested in PARADISE is whether models can demonstrate implicit knowledge of the procedural instructions/plan just from the goal. 

- Goal-plan relationship - The association between a procedural goal and the plan (instructions/steps) to achieve that goal. Models are tested on their understanding of this relationship through the warning/tip inference tasks.

- Fine-tuning - Training approach used with some models like BERT where the model is first pretrained then fine-tuned on task-specific data.

- Zero-shot learning - Training approach where the model is prompted with task examples without any specific fine-tuning on the task data.

So in summary, key terms cover the dataset itself, the task formulations, types of knowledge and reasoning evaluated, training approaches used, and the overall relationship between goals and procedural plans targeted.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper introduces the PARADISE dataset for evaluating implicit planning abilities of language models. What motivated the authors to create this new dataset rather than using existing procedural reasoning datasets? How is PARADISE different in its focus and formulation compared to prior datasets?

2. The PARADISE tasks involve inferring warnings and tips solely based on provided goals, bypassing intermediary steps. Why is this form of "abductive reasoning" better suited for evaluating implicit planning skills versus more direct step-by-step reasoning? 

3. The authors opt for a multiple choice question answering format rather than a free-form generative setup. What are the advantages of this approach, especially in terms of evalutation and model architecture flexibility?

4. What were some of the key strategies used in constructing high quality data splits, like expert annotation and dataset cartography? How did these methods help validate and analyze the datasets?

5. Both fine-tuning and zero-shot prompting experiments were conducted. Why this dual evalution strategy? What unique insights did each approach provide about the models?

6. Keyword manipulation analysis revealed memorization issues in PLMs but not in LLMs. Why this discrepancy? What hypotheses might explain the relative robustness of LLMs?  

7. Where did fine-tuned PLMs and LLMs tend to fail? What differences existed between physical/tangible and abstract/social goals?

8. How exactly were the reverse warning/tip inference tasks created? Why were they valuable for probing further understanding of the models?

9. Cross-domain experiments between tips and warnings showed strong generalization. How does this support the claim that they are highly similar/interchangable?

10. Pre-training on PARADISE data boosted performance on unseen procedural tasks like goal and step inference. What potential mechanisms enabled this positive transfer learning?
