# [Honeybee: Locality-enhanced Projector for Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) take images as additional inputs alongside text instructions to generate descriptive and coherent responses. The visual projector plays a key role in bridging vision encoders and large language models (LLMs) by converting visual features into tokens. 
- Despite the importance, projector design has been relatively less explored. Most MLLMs employ simple linear projectors or abstractors like resamplers.
- Linear projectors excel at preserving local context but lack flexibility in managing visual token counts, which impacts computational efficiency. Resamplers are flexible but lose finer details by focusing on salient regions, hurting spatial understanding.

Proposed Solution:  
- Identify two key desirable properties of projectors - (1) Flexibility in visual token counts (for efficiency) (2) Preservation of local context (for spatial understanding)
- Propose two novel locality-enhanced abstractors - Convolutional Abstractor (C-Abstractor) and Deformable Attention-based Abstractor (D-Abstractor) that achieve both flexibility and locality-preservation
- Present strategies to effectively utilize multiple instruction datasets - multifaceted balancing, granular templatization, deduplication

Contributions:
- Locality-enhanced abstractors offer better balance of efficiency and performance
- Analysis provides insights into dataset usage - task diversity, balancing, fine-grained templates improve quality
- Proposed MLLM 'Honeybee' with above outperforms state-of-the-art across metrics like MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench and LLaVA-Bench

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of existing MLLM projectors and provides architectural improvements alongside effective strategies for utilizing instruction data, leading to state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs.
