# [Honeybee: Locality-enhanced Projector for Multimodal LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06742)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) take images as additional inputs alongside text instructions to generate descriptive and coherent responses. The visual projector plays a key role in bridging vision encoders and large language models (LLMs) by converting visual features into tokens. 
- Despite the importance, projector design has been relatively less explored. Most MLLMs employ simple linear projectors or abstractors like resamplers.
- Linear projectors excel at preserving local context but lack flexibility in managing visual token counts, which impacts computational efficiency. Resamplers are flexible but lose finer details by focusing on salient regions, hurting spatial understanding.

Proposed Solution:  
- Identify two key desirable properties of projectors - (1) Flexibility in visual token counts (for efficiency) (2) Preservation of local context (for spatial understanding)
- Propose two novel locality-enhanced abstractors - Convolutional Abstractor (C-Abstractor) and Deformable Attention-based Abstractor (D-Abstractor) that achieve both flexibility and locality-preservation
- Present strategies to effectively utilize multiple instruction datasets - multifaceted balancing, granular templatization, deduplication

Contributions:
- Locality-enhanced abstractors offer better balance of efficiency and performance
- Analysis provides insights into dataset usage - task diversity, balancing, fine-grained templates improve quality
- Proposed MLLM 'Honeybee' with above outperforms state-of-the-art across metrics like MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench and LLaVA-Bench

In summary, the paper identifies limitations of existing MLLM projectors and provides architectural improvements alongside effective strategies for utilizing instruction data, leading to state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying two important properties for visual projectors in multimodal large language models (MLLMs): locality preservation of visual features and flexibility to manage the number of visual tokens. The paper proposes locality-enhanced abstractors that achieve both desirable properties.

2. Providing extensive experiments and analysis to explore effective strategies for handling multifaceted instruction datasets and the instructization process during MLLM training. This includes dataset combination, dataset balancing, template granularity, template diversity, and multi-turn templates.

3. Proposing a new MLLM called Honeybee that incorporates the locality-enhanced projector and explored training recipes. Honeybee achieves state-of-the-art performance across various MLLM benchmarks including MME, MMBench, SEED-Bench, and LLaVA-Bench.

In summary, the key contributions are around proposing a new locality-enhanced visual projector, identifying effective strategies for harnessing instruction datasets, and demonstrating superior performance of the resulting MLLM Honeybee across diverse benchmarks.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) - Models that can process and generate text conditioned on visual inputs like images.

- Visual projector - A component of MLLMs that encodes visual features from a vision encoder into tokens that can be consumed by a language model.

- Locality-enhanced projectors - The novel projectors proposed in the paper, including convolutional (C-Abstractor) and deformable attention (D-Abstractor) based abstractors, that aim to balance performance and efficiency.

- Performance vs efficiency tradeoff - A key consideration in MLLM design that the proposed projectors aim to optimize. More visual tokens can improve performance but reduce efficiency.

- Spatial understanding - A capability measured across benchmarks that requires preserving local context from images, which traditional abstractors struggle with. 

- Instruction tuning - Training technique for MLLMs using visual instruction datasets to enhance visual understanding and instruction following.

- Dataset combination and balancing - Key training considerations to maximize diverse knowledge, analyzed through systematic ablation experiments.

- Instructization - The process of formatting datasets into an instruction-following format using templates. Details like granularity and diversity are analyzed.
