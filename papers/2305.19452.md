# [Bigger, Better, Faster: Human-level Atari with human-level efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19452)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we scale neural networks to achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency in deep reinforcement learning on the Atari benchmark?In particular, the paper introduces the BBF agent and investigates techniques like scaling network width, using harder parameter resets, annealing the update horizon, increasing the discount factor, and removing noisy nets. The goal is to achieve human-level or super-human performance on the Atari benchmark with only 100K environment steps, matching the sample efficiency of model-based methods like EfficientZero. The key hypothesis seems to be that carefully scaling and regularizing larger neural networks can lead to improved sample efficiency in deep RL.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can deep reinforcement learning agents be made more sample efficient, achieving high performance with limited environment interaction?In particular, the paper focuses on the goal of achieving human-level performance on the Atari benchmark with human-level sample efficiency (about 2 hours of gameplay). To address this question, the paper introduces a new model-free RL agent called BBF that incorporates several innovations to improve sample efficiency, including:- Scaling up the neural network architecture (wider ResNet)- Harder periodic resetting of network parameters - Exponentially decreasing n-step returns- Increasing discount factor schedule  - Removal of noisy nets- Use of a target network- Incorporating weight decayThe key hypothesis seems to be that carefully incorporating these techniques will allow model-free deep RL agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Atari benchmark with unprecedented sample efficiency. The paper provides an extensive empirical evaluation to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the central research question is how to achieve human-level sample efficiency for deep RL on the Atari benchmark, with the key hypothesis being that the proposed BBF agent can accomplish this through its integrated set of innovations.
