# [TVQA+: Spatio-Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11574)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question/hypothesis addressed is: Can jointly grounding video question answering in both the spatial and temporal domains (by detecting referenced objects and temporally localizing relevant clips) improve video QA performance and interpretability? 

The authors propose the new task of spatio-temporal video QA, which requires localizing relevant moments, detecting referenced objects, and answering questions about videos. They create a new dataset (TVQA+) with spatial and temporal annotations to support this task. 

Their proposed model, Spatio-Temporal Answerer with Grounded Evidence (STAGE), is designed to perform all three subtasks jointly in an end-to-end manner. Their hypothesis is that by supervising the model to ground the evidence spatially and temporally, it will learn improved representations and achieve better video QA performance compared to models that do not explicitly perform grounding. The interpretability of the model will also be improved via visualizations of the spatial and temporal attention/grounding.

The experiments aim to demonstrate:
(1) STAGE achieves significantly better QA accuracy compared to baseline methods on the TVQA+ dataset. 
(2) Explicitly supervising spatial and temporal grounding leads to gains in QA accuracy.
(3) STAGE produces insightful visual explanations of its predictions via spatial and temporal attention.

In summary, the main hypothesis is that joint spatio-temporal grounding of evidence will improve video QA accuracy and interpretability. The TVQA+ dataset and STAGE model are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. The authors collect a new dataset called TVQA+ which augments the existing TVQA video question answering dataset with 310,826 bounding boxes linking depicted objects to visual concepts in the questions and answers. This allows for joint spatio-temporal grounding of the QA pairs.

2. The authors propose a novel end-to-end trainable neural framework called STAGE (Spatio-Temporal Answerer with Grounded Evidence) which can jointly localize relevant moments, detect referenced objects/people, and answer questions about videos. 

3. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on spatio-temporal video QA using the new TVQA+ dataset. They show performance gains from having both temporal and spatial supervision. The interpretable visualizations of temporal and spatial attention are also useful.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of spatio-temporal video QA, along with a new grounded dataset and model designed for this joint task. The new annotations and multitask learning approach allow the model to achieve significantly better video QA performance.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from this paper:

The paper introduces TVQA+, a video question answering dataset with 310K bounding box annotations linking objects to visual concepts, and proposes a model called STAGE that jointly localizes relevant clips, detects referenced objects and people, and answers questions about videos to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the TVQA benchmark.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other related research:

- This paper introduces a new dataset, TVQA+, which provides spatial grounding (bounding box annotations) in addition to temporal grounding for a video QA dataset. Most prior video QA datasets like TVQA, MovieQA, etc. only have temporal annotations. The spatial grounding is a novel contribution.

- The proposed model STAGE performs joint moment localization, object detection, and QA in an end-to-end framework. Other video QA methods like Two-Stream, ST-VQA don't explicitly localize objects or moments. Some visual grounding works like TALL, Charades-STA focus only on moment localization. 

- This paper shows strong performance gains from incorporating spatial and temporal supervision signals for video QA. Prior works have not explored this joint training. The visualization of attention also provides more interpretability.

- Compared to generic image-text pretrained models like LXMERT, features fine-tuned on in-domain datasets perform better. This highlights the domain gap between existing VQA datasets and the subtitles + QA nature of TVQA/TVQA+.

- There is still a significant gap between the STAGE model and human performance on TVQA+, indicating scope for improvement. The "why" and "how" questions are specifically challenging. More sophisticated reasoning mechanisms may be needed.

Overall, the novel dataset annotation, end-to-end trainable model, and analyses of different supervision signals are valuable contributions compared to prior art. The interpretability and performance gains demonstrate the importance of grounded representations for video QA.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Improving performance on "why" and "how" questions. The authors note that their model does not show significant gains on these types of questions, indicating that incorporating some reasoning or textual module could be beneficial.

- Adapting pretrained vision-language models like LXMERT to the video QA domain. The authors tried using LXMERT features but found performance decreased compared to their proposed model. They suggest more investigation is needed into adapting these types of models that are pretrained on image-caption data to the more complex video+dialogue domain.

- Incorporating explainability. The authors propose their model can produce interpretable visualizations of temporal and spatial attention, but do not explicitly evaluate the explainability of their model. Further work could focus on improving and quantitatively evaluating explainability.

- Continued dataset collection. The authors collected spatial annotations for a subset of the TVQA dataset. Expanding annotations to the full dataset could enable further gains.

- Improving generalization. While the authors demonstrate strong performance on TVQA+, there is still a large gap compared to human performance. Additional work is needed to improve generalization and close this gap.

- Joint Video Moment Retrieval and Question Answering. The authors note that their work takes a step towards this joint task, but further work can be done to explore and improve methods for addressing these tasks together.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents TVQA+, a new dataset for spatio-temporal video question answering. The authors augment a subset of the existing TVQA dataset with 310K bounding boxes linking depicted objects to visual concepts in the questions and answers. They also refine the temporal annotations in TVQA+ to make them tighter. Based on this new dataset, they propose the task of jointly localizing relevant moments, detecting referenced objects, and answering natural language questions about videos. They design an end-to-end trainable neural framework called STAGE to address this task. STAGE encodes the videos and text using visual and language representations, and includes modules for temporal localization, spatial localization, and question answering which share information. Experiments show STAGE outperforms previous methods on TVQA+, achieving gains of 9.83% in QA accuracy. The rich annotations in TVQA+ are shown to help with question answering. STAGE also produces better results on the full TVQA dataset compared to prior work.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces TVQA+, a new dataset for spatio-temporal video question answering. TVQA+ augments the existing TVQA dataset with over 300,000 bounding box annotations that link depicted objects to visual concepts in the questions and answers. The authors propose the task of joint moment localization, object detection, and question answering on this new dataset. They also introduce a model called STAGE (Spatio-Temporal Answerer with Grounded Evidence) to address this task in an end-to-end manner. STAGE incorporates aligned question-guided attention and span prediction to localize relevant moments and objects. Experiments show STAGE outperforms baseline methods in QA accuracy, temporal localization, and object detection metrics. Analyses also demonstrate both temporal and spatial supervision improve QA performance. The paper demonstrates the benefit of joint modeling over separately addressing the subtasks of localization and QA.

In summary, this paper makes two key contributions - it collects the new TVQA+ dataset with rich spatio-temporal groundings, and it proposes the STAGE model and joint task formulation to utilize these groundings for explainable video QA. Experiments show clear benefits of adding localization supervision and performing moment, object, and answer prediction together. The new dataset and model take an important step towards deeper video understanding for question answering.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel end-to-end trainable framework called Spatio-Temporal Answerer with Grounded Evidence (STAGE) for spatio-temporal video question answering. STAGE first encodes the video frames, subtitles, and question-answer pairs using convolutional neural networks and BERT embeddings. It then computes attention scores between question words and video objects/subtitle words to obtain question-guided representations. These representations are fused and fed to a span predictor to localize relevant moments. The localized representations, along with global representations, are concatenated and forwarded to a classifier to predict the final answer. The model is trained with both spatial supervision from bounding box annotations and temporal supervision from span annotations. By performing moment localization, object detection, and question answering together in a unified framework, STAGE is able to achieve significant performance improvement on the TVQA+ dataset compared to baseline methods.
