# [Location-guided Head Pose Estimation for Fisheye Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18320)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Head pose estimation from fisheye images is challenging due to the serious distortion effects, especially in the peripheral regions. Existing methods either use a two-stage approach of first rectifying the image and then applying a pose estimator, or directly apply pose estimators meant for pinhole camera models, both of which have limitations. The two-stage methods require accurate camera calibration parameters which may not be available. The direct methods do not properly account for the distortions.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose a novel one-stage deep learning method that uses knowledge of the head location in the fisheye image to help reduce the effects of distortion on pose estimation. They design an end-to-end convolutional neural network with a backbone feature extractor followed by a head location estimation branch and a pose estimation branch. The location branch helps provide cues about the distortion to the pose branch. They also create fisheye distorted versions of popular head pose datasets BIWI, 300W-LP and AFLW2000 for experiments.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a distortion-aware head pose estimation method for fisheye images using head location as an auxiliary task
- Design an end-to-end deep network with location and pose branches 
- Outperform state-of-the-art two-stage and one-stage methods on multiple fisheye datasets
- Show improved accuracy over baseline without location guidance through ablation studies
- Demonstrate improved speed over two-stage methods without needing explicit rectification
- Create fisheye distorted versions of BIWI, 300W-LP and AFLW2000 datasets

In summary, the paper presents a novel deep learning based method for head pose estimation tailored to fisheye images by using knowledge of location-specific distortions. This provides improved accuracy over prior arts without needing extra calibration or rectification steps.
