# [Vision-RWKV: Efficient and Scalable Visual Perception with RWKV-Like   Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02308)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Vision transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision with their ability to model global context. However, their quadratic computational complexity limits efficiency for high-resolution images or long sequences.
- There is a need for a vision architecture that retains the global modeling capacity of ViTs while reducing computational complexity to linear.

Proposed Solution - Vision-RWKV (VRWKV):
- Adapts the RWKV architecture from NLP to computer vision while making necessary modifications for handling visual data.
- Introduces quad-directional shift (Q-Shift) to expand semantic range of tokens and tailor model for vision tasks.
- Modifies causal attention in RWKV to bidirectional global attention to enable linear complexity.
- Employs techniques like relative positional encodings, flexible decay vectors and extra layer norms to ensure stable scaling.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes VRWKV as an efficient alternative to ViT, matching performance but with lower computational cost, especially for high resolutions.
- Achieves global attention in linear complexity via novel Q-Shift method and modifications to RWKV attention.
- Demonstrates stable scaling in terms of model size and input resolution.
- Shows strong performance on image classification, detection and segmentation, surpassing window-based ViTs.
- Top-1 accuracy is comparable to ViT on ImageNet while being more efficient in computation and memory.

In summary, the paper presents VRWKV as an efficient vision transformer that retains modeling capacities of ViT while reducing quadratic self-attention complexity to linear, making it suitable for high-resolution images and a potential alternative to ViT architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), an efficient vision encoder adapted from the RWKV model in NLP, which achieves comparable performance to ViT on vision tasks with lower computational complexity and memory usage thanks to its linear attention mechanism.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

(1) Proposing Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) as a low-cost alternative to ViT that achieves comparable performance and scalability to ViT but with lower computational complexity. VRWKV retains the advantages of ViT in capturing long-range dependencies and handling sparse inputs, while reducing the complexity to linear.

(2) Introducing modifications like bidirectional attention and a quad-directional token shift (Q-Shift) to adapt RWKV to computer vision tasks. Additional techniques like relative positional encodings, flexible decay vectors, and extra layer normalizations are used to ensure stable training when scaling up VRWKV.

(3) Demonstrating through experiments that VRWKV matches or exceeds the performance of ViT in image classification, detection, segmentation, and masked image modeling, while having lower FLOPs and faster processing speed, especially for high-resolution inputs. For example, VRWKV-L achieves 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with lower FLOPs than ViT-L, and outperforms window-based ViTs on dense prediction tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing VRWKV as an efficient alternative to ViT that retains ViT's advantages while reducing computational complexity to linear, and showing its effectiveness across multiple computer vision tasks.
