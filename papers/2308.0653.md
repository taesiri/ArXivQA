# [Note: Stokes-Einstein relation without hydrodynamic diameter in the   TIP4P/Ice water model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0653)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether the Stokes-Einstein relation without hydrodynamic diameter is valid for the TIP4P/Ice model of water. Specifically, the authors examine whether self-diffusion and shear viscosity data for this water model obey the microscopic form of the Stokes-Einstein relation given in Eq. (2) of the paper. They aim to demonstrate the applicability of this microscopic relation, which does not involve concepts of hydrodynamic diameter or boundary condition, to liquid water simulated using the TIP4P/Ice model. The central hypothesis is that this model of water will satisfy the Stokes-Einstein relation in its microscopic form over a range of thermodynamic conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper examines the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation without hydrodynamic diameter in the TIP4P/Ice model of water. The key findings are:- Using recent self-diffusion and viscosity data, the paper shows the microscopic SE relation Dη(Δ/kBT) = αSE holds well for the TIP4P/Ice model in the temperature and density range investigated. - The SE coefficient αSE is constrained to 0.15 ± 0.02, consistent with theoretical expectations. No adjustable parameters are involved. - This suggests the SE relation applies even for a complex fluid like water near fluid-solid phase transition, not just simple fluids. - The SE coefficient decreases slightly with increasing temperature, indicating the interaction potential softens. This agrees with past observations.- The results confirm the SE relation without hydrodynamic diameter is valid for the TIP4P/Ice water model in the density-temperature parameter space examined. This sheds new light on understanding water's transport properties across its phase diagram.In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the microscopic SE relation without hydrodynamic diameter holds remarkably well for the TIP4P/Ice model of water in the regime investigated. This provides new insights into water's transport properties.
