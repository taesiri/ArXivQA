# [Note: Stokes-Einstein relation without hydrodynamic diameter in the
  TIP4P/Ice water model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.0653)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether the Stokes-Einstein relation without hydrodynamic diameter is valid for the TIP4P/Ice model of water. Specifically, the authors examine whether self-diffusion and shear viscosity data for this water model obey the microscopic form of the Stokes-Einstein relation given in Eq. (2) of the paper. They aim to demonstrate the applicability of this microscopic relation, which does not involve concepts of hydrodynamic diameter or boundary condition, to liquid water simulated using the TIP4P/Ice model. The central hypothesis is that this model of water will satisfy the Stokes-Einstein relation in its microscopic form over a range of thermodynamic conditions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper examines the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation without hydrodynamic diameter in the TIP4P/Ice model of water. The key findings are:

- Using recent self-diffusion and viscosity data, the paper shows the microscopic SE relation Dη(Δ/kBT) = αSE holds well for the TIP4P/Ice model in the temperature and density range investigated. 

- The SE coefficient αSE is constrained to 0.15 ± 0.02, consistent with theoretical expectations. No adjustable parameters are involved. 

- This suggests the SE relation applies even for a complex fluid like water near fluid-solid phase transition, not just simple fluids. 

- The SE coefficient decreases slightly with increasing temperature, indicating the interaction potential softens. This agrees with past observations.

- The results confirm the SE relation without hydrodynamic diameter is valid for the TIP4P/Ice water model in the density-temperature parameter space examined. This sheds new light on understanding water's transport properties across its phase diagram.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating the microscopic SE relation without hydrodynamic diameter holds remarkably well for the TIP4P/Ice model of water in the regime investigated. This provides new insights into water's transport properties.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research on the Stokes-Einstein relation in water models:

- This paper provides a focused test of the microscopic Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation without hydrodynamic diameter using recent data on the TIP4P/Ice water model. Many other papers have examined the SE relation in water models, but this is one of the first to specifically look at the parameter-free microscopic version.

- The results confirm the microscopic SE relation holds well for the TIP4P/Ice model in the temperature and density range examined near the freezing point. This adds to other work showing the microscopic SE relation works for various water models like TIP4P/2005. 

- The authors observe a slight decrease in the SE coefficient with increasing temperature, suggesting some softening of interactions. This echoes other observations, like those of Ohtori et al. for TIP4P/2005 water.

- This is a relatively concise, narrowly focused study on one aspect of transport properties. Other papers have conducted broader examinations of dynamics and transport in water models across wider regions of the phase diagram.

- The authors appropriately point out breakdown of the microscopic SE relation is expected at very low densities approaching the gas phase or in deeply supercooled states near glass transition. Many other studies have explored these regimes.

- Overall, this paper provides a valuable focused test and confirmation of parameter-free SE relation in the TIP4P/Ice water model near freezing conditions, complementing other broader studies on water dynamics and transport properties.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the investigation to broader ranges of temperature and pressure/density to see where deviations from the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation emerge. The authors note the SE relation likely breaks down at lower densities and higher temperatures outside the parameter regime they studied.

- Testing other water models beyond TIP4P/Ice to see if similar agreement with the microscopic SE relation holds. The authors mention the relation holds for both TIP4P/Ice and TIP4P/2005 models. 

- Exploring transport properties and the SE relation in supercooled water approaching the glass transition. The authors state the SE relation is known to break down in deeply supercooled regimes.

- Considering the applicability of the microscopic SE relation in water along the vapor-liquid coexistence curve. The relation is expected to hold near the fluid-solid phase transition, so testing it near vapor-liquid equilibrium could be insightful.

- Investigating if trends in the magnitude of the SE coefficient with temperature correlate with interaction softening and sound velocity ratios, as the authors suggest based on comparisons with simple fluids.

- Comparing with additional experimental measurements of diffusion and viscosity in water to further validate the simulation findings.

In summary, the authors propose extending the pressure, temperature, and phase space investigated, testing other water models, and further exploring the physics behind the trends observed as important future directions stemming from this work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper examines the validity of the microscopic Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation without hydrodynamic diameter in the TIP4P/Ice model of water. Using recently published simulation data on self-diffusion and viscosity coefficients over a range of temperatures and densities, the authors find that the product of diffusion and viscosity scaled by interatomic separation and temperature is constrained to 0.15±0.02, agreeing well with theoretical expectations. This demonstrates that the microscopic SE relation holds for the TIP4P/Ice water model in the parameter regime investigated, with no free adjustable parameters. The authors note that this relation is expected to breakdown at lower densities and higher temperatures outside the range studied. Overall, the results provide new insights into transport properties and interactions in liquid water from a microscopic perspective.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper examines the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation in the TIP4P/Ice model of water. The SE relation connects the diffusion coefficient and viscosity of a fluid to the size and temperature. Typically a hydrodynamic diameter is used, but the paper looks at a microscopic version without this parameter. Using recent data on self-diffusion and viscosity coefficients over a range of temperatures and pressures, the authors find the SE relation holds well when the interatomic separation is used rather than a fixed molecular diameter. The SE coefficient they calculate is around 0.15, close to theoretical expectations. This suggests the microscopic SE relation applies to water just as it does for simple fluids, despite water's more complex properties. The authors note the SE relation likely breaks down at very high or low temperatures and densities outside the range studied. Overall, the results provide new insights into transport properties of water across its phase diagram within the TIP4P/Ice model.

In summary, this paper demonstrates the microscopic Stokes-Einstein relation without a hydrodynamic diameter is valid for the TIP4P/Ice water model under the conditions tested. This is the first confirmation the relation holds for water, similarly to simple fluids, overcoming limitations of using a fixed molecular diameter. The results shed light on modeling transport properties of water.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper demonstrates that self-diffusion and shear viscosity data for the TIP4P/Ice water model obey the microscopic version of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation without the hydrodynamic diameter. The main method is to analyze existing simulation data on diffusion coefficient D and shear viscosity η for the TIP4P/Ice model over a range of temperatures and densities. The product Dη(Δ/kBT), where Δ is the interatomic separation, is shown to lie within the expected theoretical range of 0.13-0.18 for simple fluids, indicating the SE relation holds without needing an adjustable hydrodynamic diameter. This shows the SE relation can apply even for a complex fluid like water near freezing, extending its known validity from simple liquids.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is examining the validity of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation for water, using recent simulation data on the self-diffusion and shear viscosity coefficients of the TIP4P/Ice water model. 

The SE relation connects diffusion and viscosity coefficients to temperature and characteristic length scales. The conventional macroscopic version uses a particle's hydrodynamic diameter, while a microscopic version uses the interparticle spacing instead. 

The paper tests whether the microscopic SE relation without a hydrodynamic diameter holds for the simulated TIP4P/Ice water model. This relation has been shown to be valid for various simple fluids near freezing, but its applicability to water is less established. Evaluating it for the TIP4P/Ice model provides insight into transport properties of water across its phase diagram.

In summary, the paper addresses whether the unusual properties of water violate the conventional behavior seen in simple fluids, where a microscopic SE relation without adjustable parameters is widely valid near freezing. Testing this will shed light on the nature of transport anomalies in water.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The authors demonstrate that the Stokes-Einstein relation without hydrodynamic diameter holds for the TIP4P/Ice model of water. What are the key assumptions and approximations involved in deriving this microscopic form of the Stokes-Einstein relation? How might these impact the applicability to various systems?

2. In Fig. 1, the SE coefficient αSE is shown to be confined to a relatively narrow range of 0.15 ± 0.02. What factors determine the expected range for αSE based on theory? How sensitive is αSE to the softness of the interaction potential and ratio of shear to longitudinal viscosity?

3. The authors note the SE relation is expected to break down at very low densities below the gas-liquid transition. For the LJ fluid, this occurs below ρ/ρfr ~ 0.6. What causes the breakdown at low densities? Is there a fundamental change in dynamics that violates the assumptions required?

4. How does the viscosity and diffusion scale with interatomic separation? Why does using the fixed OO distance of 2.8 Å in Fig. 1b result in some deviation from the expected SE behavior compared to using the interatomic spacing Δ in Fig. 1a?

5. The data shows a slight decreasing trend in αSE with increasing temperature. What could explain this effect? Does this indicate softening of the interaction potential? How would you further analyze this temperature dependence? 

6. In the introduction, several molecular dynamics studies are cited showing the SE relation holds for various simple fluids. Does the confirmation for the TIP4P/Ice water model provide significant new insights beyond these simple systems? What are the key properties of water that make this non-trivial?

7. Zwanzig’s model is discussed as providing theoretical explanation for the SE relation in simple fluids. Can this framework be applied directly to water? If not, what modifications or additional considerations would be needed?

8. How does the SE relation connect to other water anomalies like density maximum? Is there some common underlying cause for these effects? Does the confirmation of SE relation impose constraints on theories of water structure and dynamics?

9. The authors note breakdown of the SE relation in deeply supercooled water approaching glass transition. What causes this effect? How would you extend the study to deeply supercooled states?

10. What other water models and empirical water data could be analyzed to further test the robustness of the SE relation? How much variation do you expect between models and experiments?
