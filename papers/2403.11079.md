# [Bridging Expert Knowledge with Deep Learning Techniques for Just-In-Time   Defect Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11079)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Just-in-Time (JIT) defect prediction aims to predict whether a code change (commit) contains defects before it gets merged into the codebase. Existing approaches can be categorized into: 1) Simple models that use traditional machine learning with handcrafted features based on expert knowledge, and 2) Complex models that use deep learning to automatically extract features from commit content. However, simple models may not fully capture semantic meaning while complex models do not leverage expert knowledge. 

Solution:
This paper proposes a framework to combine both simple and complex models to create an enhanced defect prediction model called SimCom++. The framework utilizes both early fusion (on feature level) and late fusion (on decision level). For early fusion, strategies like concatenation, attention mechanism, and gating mechanism are explored to combine handcrafted features with automatically learned features. For late fusion, predictions from different models are aggregated through averaging.  

Contributions:
1. Proposes a model fusion framework to combine simple and complex models using both early and late fusion.
2. Evaluates framework by creating simple (Sim) and complex (Com) models and fusing them.
3. SimCom++, the fused model created using the framework, outperforms baselines by 5.7%-26.9% and also outperforms Sim and Com.
4. Analysis shows SimCom++ can reduce false positives of Sim and Com, and correct their wrong predictions.
5. Case studies demonstrate how expert knowledge helps guide deep learning models.

In summary, this paper effectively combines expert knowledge and deep learning models for enhanced Just-in-Time defect prediction through a model fusion framework. The combined model outperforms existing techniques significantly.
