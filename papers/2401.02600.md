# [Object-oriented backdoor attack against image captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02600)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Image captioning models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks where attackers can insert hidden triggers into images so that the model generates attacker-specified captions. 
- Prior work has explored backdoor attacks in computer vision models but there is little research on attacks against vision-language models like image captioning.

Proposed Method:
- The authors propose an object-oriented backdoor attack that poisons the training data to insert the backdoor. 
- The attack assumes the attacker has full access to the training data but cannot modify the model architecture or training process.
- The method detects objects in images, iteratively modifies the pixel values in those regions to craft image-specific triggers, and replaces captions with attacker-chosen sentences.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrate feasibility of backdoor attacking image captioning models via data poisoning, without needing to alter model or training.
- Design object-based trigger generation method to craft stealthy image-specific triggers.
- Define attack success rate and false trigger rate metrics to evaluate attack effectiveness and stealthiness.
- Experiments on Flickr8k and Flickr30k verify high attack success rate (>94%) and low impact on benign images with under 5% false trigger rate.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel object-oriented data poisoning attack against image captioning models and shows this can successfully insert hidden backdoors to control model behaviors on attacker-chosen images while maintaining performance on clean images.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an object-oriented backdoor attack method against image captioning models by poisoning the training data and inserting sample-specific triggers into object regions of images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the content of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper proves the feasibility of inserting backdoors into image captioning models using a data poisoning method. This is the first work exploring backdoor attacks against neural image captioning models.

2) The paper proposes an object-detection-based poison crafting scheme, which detects objects in images first, then iteratively modifies each region using a controllable noise generator to create sample-specific triggers. 

3) The paper defines evaluation metrics tailored for backdoor attacks against image captioning models, including Attack Success Rate (ASR) and False Trigger Rate (FTR). Experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed attack method.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and demonstrating a method for backdoor attacking neural image captioning models, using an object-oriented data poisoning approach with sample-specific triggers. The attack effectiveness and stealthiness are evaluated quantitatively. This raises awareness of defending against such backdoor threats in image captioning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, some of the main keywords or key terms associated with it are:

- Image Captioning - This refers to the task of automatically generating textual descriptions for images, which is the main focus application of the paper.

- Backdoor Attack - The paper explores performing backdoor attacks against image captioning models, where the model behaves normally on clean images but generates attacker-specified captions on poisoned images.

- Data Poisoning - The method used to implement the backdoor attack is data poisoning, where a portion of the training data is poisoned to insert the backdoor. 

- Object-Oriented - The proposed attack generates poisoned images in an object-oriented way, modifying pixel values in detected object regions iteratively.

- Stealthiness and Effectiveness - The attack aims to balance stealthiness (normal behavior on clean images) and effectiveness (generating targeted captions on poisoned images).

- Evaluation Metrics - Metrics like attack success rate, false triggered rate, and BLEU are used to evaluate the attack.

So in summary, the key terms cover image captioning, backdoor attacks, data poisoning, the object-oriented poisoning approach, and attack evaluation metrics.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using an object detector to detect objects in images before inserting triggers. What impact would using a more advanced object detector have on the effectiveness of the attack? Could it allow for more precise trigger insertion and better attack performance?

2. The noise intensity hyperparameter α is fixed at 20 in the experiments. How would varying this hyperparameter affect the visual effect of the inserted triggers and the overall attack success rate? Is there an optimal value for α?

3. The paper uses a simple target caption of "you are under attack" for all poisoned images. How could using more variable and complex target captions impact the stealthiness and effectiveness of the attack?

4. Could the proposed object-oriented trigger generation method be extended to other vision & language tasks like visual question answering? What adaptations would need to be made?

5. The paper explores a black-box attack scenario with no access to the training process. Could this attack be further improved if white-box access was available? 

6. How resilient is the proposed attack method to various trigger detection and removal defenses during inference?

7. The paper uses a show-attend-and-tell model for experiments. How would the attack effectiveness differ across other encoder-decoder models like LSTM-based or Transformer-based architectures?

8. What impact could ensembling multiple object detectors have on more comprehensively locating objects to insert triggers? Could it improve attack success rate?

9. The paper explores a targeted attack with predefined captions. How difficult would it be to extend this approach to an untargeted attack that inserts out-of-context captions?

10. How would the poisoning rate during training impact attack success rate during inference? Is there a rate that optimizes attack performance?
