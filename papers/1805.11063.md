# [Theory and Experiments on Vector Quantized Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11063)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main focus of this paper is to present a new training technique for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) based on the connection between VQ-VAEs and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The key research questions addressed are:

1) How can we connect VQ-VAE training to the classical EM algorithm? 

2) Can training VQ-VAEs with EM improve performance over standard VQ-VAE training on tasks like image generation and machine translation?

3) Can this new EM-based training procedure allow VQ-VAEs to achieve competitive performance with autoregressive models on machine translation while being significantly faster?

Specifically, the paper shows the connection between VQ-VAE training and hard EM, which is equivalent to k-means clustering. The authors then propose a soft EM training approach for VQ-VAE which allows multiple cluster assignments. 

The main hypotheses tested are:

- Soft EM training can improve image generation results for VQ-VAE on CIFAR-10 over standard VQ-VAE training.

- Soft EM training can allow VQ-VAEs to achieve competitive accuracy to autoregressive Transformer models on machine translation while being significantly faster due to parallel decoding.

The overall goal is to develop an improved training approach for discrete latent variable models based on EM, and demonstrate its effectiveness on generative modeling tasks like image generation and machine translation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a new training algorithm for vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE) based on the connection between VQ-VAE and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The key points are:

- They show the connection between VQ-VAE training and the hard EM or k-means clustering algorithm. This provides a theoretical justification for the exponential moving average update rule used in previous VQ-VAE papers. 

- Inspired by this connection, they propose a new soft EM training algorithm for VQ-VAE, where instead of assigning each data point to a single cluster, it is assigned to a mixture of clusters.

- They evaluate soft EM training on CIFAR-10 image generation and English-German neural machine translation. Key results are:

- For CIFAR-10, soft EM VQ-VAE achieves lower negative log likelihood compared to hard EM VQ-VAE.

- For translation, soft EM training is more robust and achieves better BLEU scores. Combining soft EM with knowledge distillation leads to a non-autoregressive translation model that matches the accuracy of an autoregressive baseline while being 3.3x faster.

In summary, the main contribution is a new soft EM algorithm for training VQ-VAEs, justified by the connection to EM, which improves results in image generation and especially machine translation compared to previous hard EM/k-means style training.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents theory and experiments on vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), showing that training the discrete bottleneck with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm improves image generation on CIFAR-10, and using EM training plus knowledge distillation enables a fast non-autoregressive machine translation model to nearly match the accuracy of a greedy autoregressive model while being 3.3x faster.
