# [Theory and Experiments on Vector Quantized Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11063)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The main focus of this paper is to present a new training technique for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) based on the connection between VQ-VAEs and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The key research questions addressed are:

1) How can we connect VQ-VAE training to the classical EM algorithm? 

2) Can training VQ-VAEs with EM improve performance over standard VQ-VAE training on tasks like image generation and machine translation?

3) Can this new EM-based training procedure allow VQ-VAEs to achieve competitive performance with autoregressive models on machine translation while being significantly faster?

Specifically, the paper shows the connection between VQ-VAE training and hard EM, which is equivalent to k-means clustering. The authors then propose a soft EM training approach for VQ-VAE which allows multiple cluster assignments. 

The main hypotheses tested are:

- Soft EM training can improve image generation results for VQ-VAE on CIFAR-10 over standard VQ-VAE training.

- Soft EM training can allow VQ-VAEs to achieve competitive accuracy to autoregressive Transformer models on machine translation while being significantly faster due to parallel decoding.

The overall goal is to develop an improved training approach for discrete latent variable models based on EM, and demonstrate its effectiveness on generative modeling tasks like image generation and machine translation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is developing a new training algorithm for vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAE) based on the connection between VQ-VAE and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The key points are:

- They show the connection between VQ-VAE training and the hard EM or k-means clustering algorithm. This provides a theoretical justification for the exponential moving average update rule used in previous VQ-VAE papers. 

- Inspired by this connection, they propose a new soft EM training algorithm for VQ-VAE, where instead of assigning each data point to a single cluster, it is assigned to a mixture of clusters.

- They evaluate soft EM training on CIFAR-10 image generation and English-German neural machine translation. Key results are:

- For CIFAR-10, soft EM VQ-VAE achieves lower negative log likelihood compared to hard EM VQ-VAE.

- For translation, soft EM training is more robust and achieves better BLEU scores. Combining soft EM with knowledge distillation leads to a non-autoregressive translation model that matches the accuracy of an autoregressive baseline while being 3.3x faster.

In summary, the main contribution is a new soft EM algorithm for training VQ-VAEs, justified by the connection to EM, which improves results in image generation and especially machine translation compared to previous hard EM/k-means style training.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents theory and experiments on vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), showing that training the discrete bottleneck with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm improves image generation on CIFAR-10, and using EM training plus knowledge distillation enables a fast non-autoregressive machine translation model to nearly match the accuracy of a greedy autoregressive model while being 3.3x faster.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel approach for training vector quantized autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) using ideas from the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:

- Most prior work on training discrete latent variable models relies on gradient estimators like REINFORCE or Gumbel-Softmax relaxation. This paper connects VQ-VAE to EM, providing a new theoretical perspective and training approach.

- It shows VQ-VAE trained with EM can achieve better image generation results on CIFAR-10 compared to regular VQ-VAE training. This demonstrates the benefits of the proposed training approach.

- For machine translation, it achieves a new state-of-the-art for non-autoregressive models by combining VQ-VAE, EM training, and knowledge distillation. The resulting model nearly matches an autoregressive Transformer baseline while being 3.3x faster.

- The connection to EM provides insights into training heuristics like exponential moving averages in prior VQ-VAE work. The paper shows EM helps make training more robust.

- Compared to other non-autoregressive translation models like NAT and the Latent Transformer, this work achieves significantly higher BLEU scores, demonstrating the strength of the VQ-VAE and EM approach.

Overall, this paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions over prior work on discrete latent variable models.

- Better understanding the representations learned by discrete latent variable models. While they achieve strong results, the interpretability of these discrete representations is still limited. Analyzing what is captured by the learned discrete symbols is an interesting direction.

- Exploring variations on the vector quantization approach. The authors focus on VQ-VAE but suggest investigating other ways to learn discrete representations, potentially improving on this quantization approach.

- Developing more powerful autoregressive priors over the discrete latents. The authors use a Transformer for this, but other sequential modeling approaches could be explored as the prior.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an alternate training technique for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) inspired by its connection to the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. VQ-VAE is a recently proposed method for learning discrete latent representations using a codebook and nearest neighbor lookup. The authors show how VQ-VAE training resembles the hard EM algorithm, with the encoder output as the data point and the discrete latent code as the cluster assignment. They propose using a soft version of EM where the encoder output is assigned to a mixture of latent codes instead of just the nearest neighbor. 

The authors evaluate their proposed soft EM training on unconditional image generation using CIFAR-10 and on neural machine translation using WMT English-German. On CIFAR-10, soft EM achieves better log perplexity compared to hard EM VQ-VAE. For translation, soft EM training provides a small improvement in BLEU score over hard EM and makes training more robust. By combining soft EM with increased codebook size and knowledge distillation, the authors are able to develop a non-autoregressive translation model that achieves 26.7 BLEU, almost matching the 27.0 BLEU of an autoregressive baseline while being 3.3x faster. Overall, the work demonstrates the effectiveness of soft EM training for discrete latent variable models like VQ-VAE.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new training technique for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) inspired by the connection between VQ-VAE and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Instead of using hard EM which assigns each data point to a single cluster like in standard VQ-VAE training, the authors propose using a soft EM algorithm where each data point is assigned to a mixture of clusters.

This soft EM training makes VQ-VAE training more robust and leads to improved image generation results on CIFAR-10. When combined with knowledge distillation, it allows developing a non-autoregressive neural machine translation model that achieves accuracy close to an autoregressive baseline while being significantly faster. The main novelty is using ideas from soft EM to train the discrete bottleneck in VQ-VAE instead of hard EM used in prior work.
