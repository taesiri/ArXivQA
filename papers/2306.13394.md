# MME: A Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language   Models

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the main research focus is on developing a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The key motivations and goals behind creating this new benchmark, which is called MME, are:- Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs have limitations, such as using datasets that models may have trained on, focusing on just one capability, or using open-ended evaluations that are hard to quantitatively analyze. - There is a need for a unified benchmark that can comprehensively evaluate both the perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs through a diverse set of tasks.- The benchmark should avoid potential data leakage issues by using novel data/annotations not taken directly from public datasets. - The instructions should be simple and consistent across models to enable fair comparison, rather than relying heavily on prompt engineering.- The evaluation should allow for quantitative analysis, rather than just open-ended scoring.So in summary, the main research focus is on proposing MME as a new comprehensive, rigorous, and quantitative benchmark suited for evaluating the latest MLLMs in a fair and informative way. The paper then provides an extensive empirical analysis of 12 different MLLMs using this new benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new benchmark called MME for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MME aims to comprehensively measure both the perception and cognition capabilities of MLLMs. 2. It collects data for 14 subtasks under MME to test different abilities of MLLMs, including coarse-grained recognition, fine-grained recognition, OCR, commonsense reasoning, numerical calculation, text translation, and code reasoning. The data sources and instruction-answer pairs are manually created instead of using existing datasets directly. 3. It evaluates 12 state-of-the-art MLLMs on the MME benchmark and provides quantitative results, leaderboards, as well as analysis of the models' strengths and weaknesses. The experiments expose some common problems of current MLLMs.4. It provides guidance for future MLLM research and development based on the findings from the comprehensive evaluation. The paper calls for the community's attention to the reliability of MLLM-generated answers.In summary, the main contribution is proposing the novel MME benchmark and using it to conduct a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the latest MLLMs, revealing their capabilities and issues to provide insights for future improvements. MME aims to serve as an authoritative benchmark for measuring MLLM progress.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents MME, a new comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models on both perception and cognition tasks across 14 subareas, and uses it to assess 12 models, revealing common problems like failing to follow instructions, lacking perception and reasoning abilities, and hallucinating objects.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is an analysis comparing this paper to other research in the field of multimodal large language model (MLLM) evaluation:This paper presents MME, a new comprehensive evaluation benchmark for MLLMs. MME has several notable features that distinguish it from prior work:- Covers both perception and cognition abilities across 14 diverse subtasks. Most prior benchmarks focus on just one or a few capabilities (e.g. object hallucination, robustness). MME aims to provide a more holistic assessment. - Uses manually created data/annotations to avoid test set leakage risks. Other benchmarks often reuse existing public datasets, but the training data for large models is not standardized. - Employs simple binary yes/no instructions for quantitative analysis. Other open-ended evaluations rely on manual scoring or models like GPT that can introduce subjectivity.- Evaluates 12 state-of-the-art MLLMs. The scope of models benchmarked is much wider than most prior studies that evaluate just 1 or 2 models.Some related works on MLLM evaluation include:- Li et al. (2023) evaluated object hallucination on a small custom dataset. Focuses on a single capability.- Zhao et al. (2023) benchmarked adversarial robustness. Again a narrow focus. - Ye et al. (2023) collected 50 open-ended images but lacks scale and uses GPT scoring.- Concurrent works like LAMM-Benchmark and LVLM-eHub also propose comprehensive benchmarks but take different approaches to MME.In summary, MME makes valuable contributions as the first large-scale, holistic benchmark using novel techniques like custom data/annotations and binary instructions for standardized quantitative analysis across a wide range of state-of-the-art MLLMs. It represents an important advance in rigorous MLLM evaluation.
