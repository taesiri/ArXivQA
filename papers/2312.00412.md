# [SCHEME: Scalable Channer Mixer for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00412)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a new Scalable CHannEl MixEr (SCHEME) module to improve the channel mixer block in vision transformers (ViTs). The SCHEME module combines: (1) a Block Diagonal MLP (BD-MLP) that uses sparse feature mixing to enable larger expansion ratios and (2) a Channel Covariance Attention (CCA) branch that helps cluster features during training. Experiments show BD-MLP alone can achieve comparable accuracy to standard MLPs and CCA further improves class separability of learned features without increasing inference cost. CCA uses channel correlations to reweight features and the authors find its contribution decays over training once good feature clusters form. Thus, CCA can be removed at test time. Replacing MLP blocks in ViTs with the SCHEME module enables flexible scaling and improved accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. The authors demonstrate this via a new family of SCHEMEformer models that outperform baselines, especially for smaller models. Gains generalize across classification, detection and segmentation. Overall, SCHEME enables sparse feature mixing to improve vision transformers with minimal overhead.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a scalable channel mixer module called SCHEME that combines a block diagonal MLP to enable larger expansion ratios and a channel covariance attention mechanism to induce better feature clustering, improving vision transformer performance especially for smaller models, with the attention branch only needed during training and removable at inference for free gains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing the SCHEME module for vision transformers. The SCHEME module combines:

1) A block diagonal MLP (BD-MLP) that enables using higher expansion ratios in the MLP mixer to achieve better accuracy, while keeping computational complexity manageable.

2) A channel covariance attention (CCA) mechanism that is used during training to help the BD-MLP learn better feature clusters. The CCA branch decays during training and can be removed at inference without loss in accuracy.

The combination allows transformers to achieve better accuracy and parameter efficiency. The paper shows this by introducing a family of SCHEMEformer models with improved accuracy/complexity tradeoffs compared to previous vision transformers. Experiments on image classification, detection and segmentation with different backbones consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SCHEME module.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Vision Transformers (ViTs)

- Block diagonal MLP (BD-MLP) 
- Channel covariance attention (CCA)
- Scalable channel mixer (SCHEME)
- SCHEMEformer models
- Improved accuracy and complexity tradeoffs
- Larger expansion ratios in MLP

- Inference efficiency 

The paper proposes a scalable channel mixer module called SCHEME that combines a BD-MLP and CCA branch. The BD-MLP enables larger expansion ratios in the MLP to improve accuracy, while the CCA branch helps cluster features during training. The CCA branch decays during training and can be removed at inference, improving parameter and computational efficiency. The SCHEME module is used to create SCHEMEformer models that achieve better accuracy/complexity tradeoffs compared to prior ViTs, especially for smaller models, by supporting larger MLP expansion ratios. Concepts like feature clustering, expansion ratios, inference efficiency, and improved accuracy/complexity tradeoffs seem central to this work.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the SCHEME method proposed in the paper:

1) How does the block diagonal MLP (BD-MLP) allow for larger expansion ratios in the MLP mixer compared to standard dense MLP mixers? What is the computational complexity and how does it scale?

2) What is the motivation behind using channel covariance attention (CCA)? How does CCA help in forming better feature clusters during training? 

3) The authors state that the CCA branch acts as a regularizer during training. Explain this statement and how the weights in the CCA branch evolve during training to support this claim.

4) Analyze the class separability experiments in Figure 6 (right). How does CCA improve class separability of the feature clusters? What can be inferred about the clusters formed with and without CCA?

5) The SCHEME module combines the BD-MLP and CCA branches. Explain how both components complement each other - what does BD-MLP lack and how does CCA help alleviate that?

6) How is SCHEME used to derive the SCHEMEformer family of models? Explain the scaling process and how SCHEME allows flexible control over model complexity.

7) Compare the accuracy vs FLOPs trade-off of the SCHEMEformer models with baseline models in Figure 1 (right). Analyze the trends - why are improvements larger for smaller models?

8) What are some alternative designs explored for the channel attention branch in Table 5? How do they compare with CCA in terms of accuracy and computational overhead?

9) The SCHEME module generalizes well across model architectures and vision tasks. Analyze the gains for object detection and segmentation - why are gains larger than for classification?

10) Identify any potential limitations of the current SCHEME design. Can you think of extensions to the method to handle such limitations?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Vision transformers (ViTs) have become popular for computer vision tasks. Most prior work has focused on improving the token mixing block (attention) of ViTs. However, the channel mixing block (MLP) has received little attention despite accounting for most parameters and computation. Naively increasing the MLP expansion ratio improves accuracy but causes explosion in complexity. 

Proposed Solution: 
This paper proposes a Scalable CHannEl MixEr (SCHEME) to improve MLP efficiency. SCHEME uses two components:

1) Block diagonal MLP (BD-MLP): Splits features into groups and performs MLP independently within each group. This allows using larger expansion ratios for the same complexity.

2) Channel covariance attention (CCA): A parallel branch that enables communication between groups using feature correlations. CCA helps form better feature clusters during training. The CCA branch weight decays during training, allowing CCA removal at inference.

So SCHEME combines sparse BD-MLP for efficiency and CCA to improve training. CCA regularization is removed at inference leading to higher accuracy without extra parameters or FLOPs.

Contributions:
1) Show MLP expansion is critical for ViT accuracy and propose SCHEME for efficient scaling.

2) Introduce BD-MLP and CCA components that improve accuracy and cluster features. 

3) CCA enables training better feature groups and can be removed once formed without loss.

4) Introduce SCHEMEformer models with SCHEME that achieve SOTA accuracy vs complexity trade-offs. Experiments on image classification, detection and segmentation with various backbones show consistent gains.

In summary, the paper improves ViT channel mixing efficiency during both training and inference with the SCHEME module while enabling flexible accuracy-complexity trade-off.
