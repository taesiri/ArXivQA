# [Alternatives to the Scaled Dot Product for Attention in the Transformer   Neural Network Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09406)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes alternative scalings to the scaled dot product used for attention in the transformer neural network architecture. The standard approach divides the dot product of the query and key vectors by the square root of the key dimension before applying softmax. This scaling avoids vanishing gradients by preventing the dot products from getting too large in magnitude. The author suggests instead dividing by the sum of the key lengths, arguing based on simulations that this preserves the distributional shape of the dot products better across a variety of situations. The intuition is that relative to the total key lengths, the individual dot products cannot get too large. Hence, applying softmax after this rescaling avoids extreme distortion, while still allowing differentiation. The paper shows through graphical analysis that the proposed rescaling outperforms the standard approach for simulated normal data. Further testing in real transformer implementations would be needed, but the analysis suggests promise for this simple adjustment to improve attention.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key point made in the paper:

The paper proposes dividing the dot product attention in the transformer architecture by the sum of the key lengths rather than the square root of the key dimension before applying softmax, which simulations show helps avoid vanishing gradients in many situations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes using the sum of the key lengths rather than the square root of the key dimension to scale the dot products before applying softmax in the attention mechanism of the transformer neural network architecture. The main contribution is showing through simulations that dividing by the sum of the key lengths appears to preserve the distribution shape of the dot products better in many situations, thus helping avoid vanishing gradients when softmax is applied.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes dividing the dot product by the sum of the key lengths rather than the square root of the key dimension before applying softmax. What is the intuition behind using the sum of the key lengths instead? How might this help alleviate vanishing gradients?

2. The paper suggests viewing the scaling in the transformer architecture's attention mechanism not as part of the scalar attention function but rather as part of the rescaling function. What is the benefit of this perspective shift? How does it open up new possibilities for exploration?

3. The author conducts simulations using standard normal distributions for the query and key components. What happens to the relative performance of the two scaling methods when the distribution family or distribution parameters change? Why might dividing by the sum of key lengths be more robust?  

4. The paper mentions dividing the dot product by the average key length rather than the total key length. What are the potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach? When might one be preferred over the other?

5. Could the choice of scaling factor depend on the context or intended application? What criteria could be used to select the most appropriate scaling for a given transformer model? 

6. The paper suggests some alternative scaling factors, like sums of different powers of the key lengths. Why weren't these as effective in the simulations? When might alternatives like these be worth exploring further?

7. What role does the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality play in the motivation for using the sum of key lengths? How does it provide intuition about why this helps avoid distortion from softmax?

8. What types of further testing would be needed to conclusively demonstrate the benefits of this new scaling approach in the full transformer architecture? What metrics would clearly indicate improved performance?

9. The author released an R package to generate the simulations and plots from this paper. What additional analyses could be performed using this package to further probe the properties of different scaling methods? 

10. How difficult would it be to implement this new scaling in existing transformer codebases? What changes would need to be made? Could it be implemented modularly to allow testing of different scaling options?
