# [Benchmarking Knowledge Boundary for Large Language Model: A Different   Perspective on Model Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11493)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) use fixed prompts/questions, which is unreliable due to the sensitivity of LLMs to prompts.
- Evaluating LLMs using a small set of prompts does not provide a comprehensive assessment of their knowledge capabilities. 

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new concept of "knowledge boundary" to evaluate LLMs more robustly. This encompasses both prompt-agnostic knowledge and prompt-sensitive knowledge within the model. 
- Formulate the problem of finding optimal prompts to reveal knowledge boundaries as a discrete optimization task.
- Propose a novel algorithm called Projected Gradient Descent with Constraints (PGDC) to search over semantic space to find optimal prompts.

Key Contributions:
- New paradigm for benchmarking knowledge boundaries of LLMs to provide more reliable evaluation.
- Design a prompt optimization method PGDC that outperforms baselines in detecting knowledge while preserving semantics.
- Evaluate 5 LLMs using PGDC, analyze their domain knowledge capabilities and limitations. 
- Findings provide guidance for appropriate LLM selection and design for downstream tasks.
- Open up a new direction in semantic-preserving prompt optimization for model evaluation.

In summary, this paper addresses the unreliability in existing LLM evaluation approaches due to prompt sensitivity issues. It proposes a novel prompt optimization algorithm to find optimal prompts that can reveal comprehensive knowledge boundaries of models for more robust assessment. Both quantitative experiments and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of this new evaluation paradigm and algorithm.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel concept of knowledge boundary to evaluate language models, and designs an algorithm called PGDC to optimize prompts and obtain more comprehensive and reliable assessments of models' knowledge capacities across domains.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing a new evaluation paradigm for benchmarking knowledge boundaries of language models to compare their capabilities. This aims to reduce the randomness in current evaluations that use fixed prompts. 

2) Designing PGDC, a projected gradient descent algorithm with constraints, to optimize prompts and obtain knowledge boundaries of language models. Experiments show this method achieves the best results on four datasets.

3) Evaluating five language models using knowledge boundaries obtained by PGDC, and obtaining some valuable findings about their domain knowledge capacities. For example, the size of the model's domain knowledge boundaries correlates with downstream task performance in that domain.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Knowledge boundary - A new concept proposed to evaluate the knowledge capacity of language models in a more robust and comprehensive way, encompassing both prompt-agnostic and prompt-sensitive knowledge.

- Prompt sensitivity - The phenomenon that language models are sensitive to how prompts are phrased, which affects evaluation. 

- Prompt optimization - The paper proposes a new prompt optimization method called PGDC to identify optimal prompts that elicit knowledge within language models' boundaries.

- Model evaluation - The paper evaluates and compares several language models based on their knowledge boundaries in different domains.

- Projected gradient descent - A key component of the PGDC algorithm that searches prompt space through gradient descent and projects updated embeddings to nearby discrete tokens.

- Semantic constraint - PGDC introduces a semantic loss term to ensure optimized prompts have consistent semantics as original questions.

- Knowledge boundary requirements - The paper outlines 4 criteria for methods to effectively estimate knowledge boundaries: universality, truthfulness, robustness and optimality.

In summary, the key focus is on more reliable and comprehensive language model evaluation through the concept of knowledge boundaries and a prompt optimization approach to identify those boundaries.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new concept of "knowledge boundary". What are the key differences between knowledge boundary and previous model evaluation paradigms? How does evaluating models with knowledge boundary help address the limitations of existing approaches?

2. The paper formulates optimal prompt searching as a discrete optimization problem. Explain the formulation in detail. What is the objective function and what constraints are introduced? How does this formulation help find optimal prompts that elicit unanswerable knowledge?  

3. The PGDC algorithm employs projected gradient descent to search for optimal prompts. Walk through the steps of the PGDC algorithm and explain how projected gradient descent allows flexible transformation between embedding space and text space.

4. What are the four fundamental requirements outlined in the paper for algorithms to calculate knowledge boundaries? Explain how PGDC meets each of those requirements.

5. The loss function for PGDC contains three terms - generation loss, semantic loss, and regularization loss. Explain the role each loss term plays in guiding the search for optimal prompts. How are the losses weighted?

6. Qualitative analysis revealed three main ways PGDC manages to update prompts - finding optimal paraphrases, leaving space for reasoning, and modifying format/stopwords. Elaborate on some examples that demonstrate these advantages.  

7. Experiments showed PGDC significantly outperforms baselines in eliciting knowledge on common knowledge benchmarks. Analyze the limitations of other methods that contribute to their poorer performance in computing knowledge boundaries.

8. How was the semantic consistency between original questions and PGDC prompts evaluated? Discuss the human evaluation protocol and results on semantic preservation.

9. The paper discovers interesting findings about different models' domain knowledge boundaries using PGDC evaluation on MMLU. Summarize the key observations and discuss their practical implications.

10. While evaluating counterfactual knowledge benchmarks, the success rate of PGDC was higher than zero-shot but lower than few-shot prompting. Speculate on the reasons behind this result - does it reveal a limitation of PGDC? How can the robustness be further improved?
