# [Towards More Faithful Natural Language Explanation Using Multi-Level   Contrastive Learning in VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13594)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing visual question answering (VQA) models with natural language explanation (VQA-NLE) suffer from issues that reduce the faithfulness of the generated explanations, including:
1) Deductive unsatisfiability - the generated explanations do not logically lead to the answers.
2) Factual inconsistency - the explanations falsify counterfactual information without considering visual evidence.  
3) Semantic perturbation insensitivity - the explanations fail to recognize meaning changes from small input perturbations.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a Multi-level Contrastive Learning based natural language Explanation (MCLE) framework to address the above issues and generate more faithful and logically consistent explanations in VQA-NLE. The key components include:

1. A vision-language model with chain-of-thought generation strategy to mimic the reasoning process leading to the answer.  
2. A multi-level contrastive learning network with three levels:
   - Semantic-level contrast - brings explanations semantically closer to answers
   - Image-level contrast - relates explanations to visual evidence  
   - Instance-level contrast - makes explanations sensitive to input perturbations

The contrastive losses encourage discriminative representation learning to align explanations, questions and answers.

Main Contributions:
1) A new state-of-the-art VQA-NLE method with a multi-level contrastive learning framework to improve logical consistency and faithfulness of explanations.
2) A chain-of-thought generation strategy that boosts answer accuracy while enhancing reliability of explanations.  
3) Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrating improved performance over existing methods on two VQA-NLE benchmarks VQA-X and A-OKVQA.

In summary, the paper addresses key limitations around the faithfulness of explanations in VQA-NLE through an innovative multi-level contrastive learning approach to enhance logical and factual consistency.
