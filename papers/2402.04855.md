# [Dual-Path Coupled Image Deraining Network via Spatial-Frequency   Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04855)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Single image deraining is challenging as rain degradations and backgrounds are highly coupled spatially. Most methods focus on spatial domain and neglect critical frequency information. 
- Existing methods utilize self-attention along only a single dimension (spatial or channel), limiting receptive fields.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes a Dual-Path Coupled Deraining Network (DPCNet) to enhance spatial-frequency information interaction for image deraining.
- Contains Spatial Feature Extraction Block (SFEBlock) and Frequency Feature Extraction Block (FFEBlock) to extract features from both spatial and frequency domains.
- Proposes Spatial-Channel Transformer Block (SCTB) to model pixel relationships across both spatial and channel dimensions simultaneously.  
- Introduces Adaptive Fusion Module (AFM) to interactively aggregate spatial and frequency features.

Main Contributions:
- An effective architecture facilitating spatial-frequency interaction for image deraining. Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art on benchmark datasets.
- Proposal of SCTB to model dual-dimensional context, increasing receptive field. 
- Extensive experiments validate performance and robustness on both synthetic and real datasets, raindrop scenarios, and downstream detection tasks.

In summary, the paper proposes a dual-path transformer-based network for image deraining that interactively models spatial and frequency domain features to effectively remove rain while reconstructing high quality backgrounds. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
