# Baize: An Open-Source Chat Model with Parameter-Efficient Tuning on   Self-Chat Data

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop an open-source chat model with good performance on multi-turn dialogues while using limited computational resources?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) A high-quality multi-turn chat corpus can be automatically generated by having ChatGPT engage in self-chat conversations.2) Parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA can be used to effectively adapt large language models like LLaMA to the chat domain, even with limited compute and data. 3) A technique called Self-Distillation with Feedback (SDF) can further improve the chat performance of the resulting model (named Baize) by incorporating feedback from ChatGPT.In summary, the paper is investigating methodologies to create performant open-source chat models with limited resources, using techniques like self-chat data generation, parameter-efficient tuning, and self-distillation with feedback. The overall goal seems to be developing an accessible alternative to proprietary chat models that poses fewer risks and barriers to research progress.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a novel pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-turn chat corpus by having ChatGPT engage in self-conversation. This provides a valuable dataset for training and evaluating chat models. 2. Using parameter-efficient tuning (specifically LoRA) to fine-tune the open-source LLaMA model on the self-chat corpus, resulting in Baize - an accessible and capable chat model.3. Introducing a new technique called Self-Distillation with Feedback (SDF) to further improve Baize's performance by leveraging feedback from ChatGPT.4. Releasing the Baize models and self-chat corpus to facilitate research in conversational AI, particularly with regard to multi-turn dialogues. This contributes open-source alternatives to proprietary chat models.In summary, the key contribution seems to be developing an end-to-end pipeline leveraging ChatGPT to create high-quality data and an accessible chat model (Baize). The self-chat data generation and parameter efficient tuning to create Baize appear central to their proposed approach.
