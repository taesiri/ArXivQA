# [Towards Equitable Agile Research and Development of AI and Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI/ML and robotics systems often replicate and amplify existing biases and fail to respect people's rights or meet claimed equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) goals. Organizations lack capabilities to recognize and address failures.
- Harms arise from preventable equity issues across development lifecycles. Issues viewed as "out of scope" or someone else's responsibility.
- Motivating examples show systems that decrease productivity, assign labels based on appearance, impose costs on marginalized groups, etc.

Solution - Framework for More Equitable AI/ML and Robotics R&D:
- Adapt principles of rights, equity, diversity and inclusion to research and development lifecycles.
- Propose adding steps to popular Agile development process:
   - New meetings, equity tasks, education timeblocks
   - Governance model with participants
   - Scorecards to evaluate project
   - Pause/stop triggers
   - Resource tracking
   - Ethical analysis and equity logs
- Apply to planning, data collection, organizational culture to support inclusion.
- Bidirectional translation between academia and industry to integrate practical tools into AI/robotics projects.

Contributions:
- Framework to build organizational equity capabilities and integrate evidence-based practices into R&D lifecycles.
- Adaptation of Agile, a widely adopted industry project methodology, to facilitate practices and mitigate harms.
- Scorecards for participants to provide feedback on project's treatment of impacted groups.
- Illustration using popular methodology enables easier adoption and technology translation.

The framework scopes interventions to human processes, culture and final outputs to enact positive change in AI/robotics development.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an equitable agile framework for research and development of AI and robotics to build organizational capabilities that respect rights, equity, and justice by integrating best practices into iterative development processes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes an framework for adapting widely practiced R&D project management methodologies like Agile development to build organizational equity capabilities and integrate known evidence-based best practices for more ethical and equitable AI and robotics. 

2. It provides concrete steps to operationalize concepts like "nothing about us without us" into the agile development process through new meeting components, artifact tracking, governance models, and assessment scorecards. 

3. It aims to support bidirectional translation between academic insights and industry practice to ensure reliable and equitable outcomes in AI/ML and robotics projects, while providing a toolkit to detect and address negative impacts early on.

In summary, the paper contributes a practical framework to integrate equity considerations into the agile R&D process for AI/ML and robotics in both academia and industry. The goal is to build organizational capabilities to respect rights, meet EDI goals, and recognize/address failures through participatory and adaptive processes.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Agile development 
- Scrum
- Equity
- Diversity and inclusion (DEI)
- Marginalized identities/groups
- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Robotics
- Human-robot interaction (HRI)  
- Participatory design
- Ethics
- Governance models
- Scorecards
- Stakeholders
- Accessibility
- Environment/sustainability

The paper proposes an adapted agile development framework that incorporates principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion to help mitigate potential harms from AI and robotics systems. It connects insights from fields like responsible computing, systems engineering, disability studies, critical race theory, and science and technology studies. The framework includes new meeting components, project assessment scorecards completed by participants, and attention to marginalized identities. The goal is to build more ethical, accountable processes in AI/robotics research and development.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes adapting the Scrum agile development process to support more equitable outcomes. What are some potential challenges or limitations in using Scrum as a starting point? How could the process account for power dynamics within an organization that might override equity concerns?

2. The paper discusses integrating participatory design methods. What specific techniques from participatory design could be used at different stages of the proposed process (e.g. hypothesis generation, project design)? How can participatory methods empower impacted communities?  

3. The paper argues that most organizations currently lack the capabilities to meet their own ethical goals and obligations. What capabilities need to be built? What methods or scorecards could assess if an organization has those capabilities? 

4. The paper proposes several new roles and ceremonies compared to typical Scrum processes. What is the purpose and value of those new elements? What implementation challenges might they raise?  

5. The framework incorporates a "pause and stop" process for rapidly flagging ethical concerns. What factors determine whether to pause/stop parts of a project versus the whole project? What policies and safety culture need to be in place?

6. What are some examples of how the gating questions provided could prevent unnecessary or harmful work? How should gating questions be updated as a project evolves?  

7. The paper argues project teams should have dedicated education time on equity issues. What core competencies are needed? What curriculum resources currently exist and what gaps need to be filled?  

8. What are some ways the framework could support researchers and staff from marginalized backgrounds? What policies and practices should be in place?   

9. The paper proposes compensation pools and labor credits for uncredited work. What lessons can be adapted from existing policies like the ADA or FMLA? What challenges might this raise?

10. The participant-led project scorecards aim to assess collaboration and burden. What validation has been done on the scorecards? How could results be analyzed while protecting privacy?
