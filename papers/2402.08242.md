# [Towards Equitable Agile Research and Development of AI and Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08242)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI/ML and robotics systems often replicate and amplify existing biases and fail to respect people's rights or meet claimed equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) goals. Organizations lack capabilities to recognize and address failures.
- Harms arise from preventable equity issues across development lifecycles. Issues viewed as "out of scope" or someone else's responsibility.
- Motivating examples show systems that decrease productivity, assign labels based on appearance, impose costs on marginalized groups, etc.

Solution - Framework for More Equitable AI/ML and Robotics R&D:
- Adapt principles of rights, equity, diversity and inclusion to research and development lifecycles.
- Propose adding steps to popular Agile development process:
   - New meetings, equity tasks, education timeblocks
   - Governance model with participants
   - Scorecards to evaluate project
   - Pause/stop triggers
   - Resource tracking
   - Ethical analysis and equity logs
- Apply to planning, data collection, organizational culture to support inclusion.
- Bidirectional translation between academia and industry to integrate practical tools into AI/robotics projects.

Contributions:
- Framework to build organizational equity capabilities and integrate evidence-based practices into R&D lifecycles.
- Adaptation of Agile, a widely adopted industry project methodology, to facilitate practices and mitigate harms.
- Scorecards for participants to provide feedback on project's treatment of impacted groups.
- Illustration using popular methodology enables easier adoption and technology translation.

The framework scopes interventions to human processes, culture and final outputs to enact positive change in AI/robotics development.
