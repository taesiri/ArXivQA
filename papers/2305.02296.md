# [DynamicStereo: Consistent Dynamic Depth from Stereo Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02296)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the main research question this paper addresses is: 

How can we improve the temporal consistency of depth estimates from stereo videos?

The key ideas and contributions are:

1) They propose a new method called DynamicStereo that uses a transformer architecture to estimate disparity (depth) from stereo videos in a temporally consistent manner. It processes sequences of frames jointly rather than individual frames.

2) They introduce a new synthetic dataset called Dynamic Replica containing stereo videos of animated humans and animals. This provides training data for temporally consistent depth estimation.

3) They demonstrate improved results over prior methods in terms of both accuracy and temporal consistency when evaluating on standard benchmarks as well as their new dataset.

In summary, the paper focuses on the problem of temporally inconsistent depth estimates from stereo methods, especially for dynamic non-rigid scenes. Their proposed solution is a novel transformer-based architecture that processes sequences of frames together to improve consistency. They also contribute a new dataset to support learning and benchmarking in this area.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. A new synthetic stereo video dataset called Dynamic Replica for training and evaluating temporally consistent depth estimation models for dynamic scenes with people and animals. This dataset contains 524 videos rendered at 1280x720 resolution.

2. A transformer-based model called DynamicStereo that performs temporally consistent stereo matching on videos by incorporating self- and cross-attention across time, space, and stereo views. The model uses divided attention for efficiency.

3. Demonstrating state-of-the-art dynamic depth estimation results on benchmarks using the proposed DynamicStereo model trained on the new Dynamic Replica dataset. The model shows improved temporal consistency compared to prior methods.

4. Analyses showing that the Dynamic Replica dataset can boost performance of existing stereo methods and that ablations validate the design choices of the proposed DynamicStereo model.

In summary, the main contribution is a new synthetic video dataset and transformer-based model for temporally consistent dynamic depth estimation, along with analyses demonstrating improved performance. The key ideas are leveraging attention across time and views for consistency and using a large-scale realistic synthetic video dataset for training dynamic depth models.
