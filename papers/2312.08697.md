# [Incomplete Contrastive Multi-View Clustering with High-Confidence   Guiding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08697)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel end-to-end framework called Incomplete Contrastive Multi-View Clustering (ICMVC) for performing clustering on incomplete multi-view data. The key ideas are: 1) Handle missing values by transferring consistency relations between views and using graph convolutional networks to fill in missing representations. 2) Fuse views using an instance-level attention module to exploit complementary information between views. 3) Align view representations using instance-level contrastive learning to exploit consistent information. 4) Optimize the entire pipeline end-to-end, unifying missing value handling, representation learning, and clustering. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with particular improvements on datasets with higher rates of missing values. The method is also shown to be robust across random initializations. Key innovations are the end-to-end learning framework, transfer of consistency relations to fill missing views, and use of instance-level attention and contrastive learning to exploit complementary and consistent information between views.
