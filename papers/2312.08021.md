# [Improving search relevance of Azure Cognitive Search by Bayesian   optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08021)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to optimize the search relevance in Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) by tuning the weights of various searchable fields and boosting features. The idea is to leverage historical user search query and click-through rate data to define an objective function, normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), that measures search relevance. This nDCG function is then maximized using Bayesian optimization by treating the ACS weights as hyperparameters. When tested on two Microsoft commercial web portals, AppSource and Azure Portal, this optimization procedure led to significant nDCG improvements of 9.7% and 1.7% respectively. Additional real-world AB testing showed a 1.2% increase in click-through rate, indicating the practical value of the optimized ACS configuration. By formulating search relevance optimization as a hyperparameter tuning problem, the methodology presented is generically applicable to any corpus leveraging ACS. Key results include properly ranking relevant items higher, especially for popular search queries. Overall, this data-driven strategy for tuning ACS demonstrates how to scientifically improve search quality over heuristic methods to meet business goals.
