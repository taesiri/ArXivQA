# [Improving search relevance of Azure Cognitive Search by Bayesian   optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08021)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method to optimize the search relevance in Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) by tuning the weights of various searchable fields and boosting features. The idea is to leverage historical user search query and click-through rate data to define an objective function, normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), that measures search relevance. This nDCG function is then maximized using Bayesian optimization by treating the ACS weights as hyperparameters. When tested on two Microsoft commercial web portals, AppSource and Azure Portal, this optimization procedure led to significant nDCG improvements of 9.7% and 1.7% respectively. Additional real-world AB testing showed a 1.2% increase in click-through rate, indicating the practical value of the optimized ACS configuration. By formulating search relevance optimization as a hyperparameter tuning problem, the methodology presented is generically applicable to any corpus leveraging ACS. Key results include properly ranking relevant items higher, especially for popular search queries. Overall, this data-driven strategy for tuning ACS demonstrates how to scientifically improve search quality over heuristic methods to meet business goals.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to optimize the search relevance of Azure Cognitive Search for specific use cases by formulating the problem as Bayesian hyperparameter tuning of the search engine's internal weighting parameters using historical user click-through rate data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors propose a novel method to optimize the search relevance of Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) for specific use cases like product search or document search. Their key contributions are:

1) They formulate the search relevance optimization problem as a Bayesian hyperparameter tuning task. The ACS field weights and boost values are treated as hyperparameters and optimized to maximize the normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) metric on historical search data. 

2) They demonstrate this optimization approach on two Microsoft commercial web portals - AppSource and Azure Portal. By tuning the weights and boost values specifically for the datasets and search queries on these portals, they achieve significant lifts in nDCG metric - 9.7% for AppSource and 1.7% for Azure Portal.

3) They validate the optimized ACS configuration through live A/B testing on the Azure Portal, showing a real-world click-through rate increase of 1.2%. The optimized weights are now used for all web traffic on these commercial marketplaces.

In summary, the key novelty is formulating ACS optimization for search relevance as a Bayesian hyperparameter tuning problem, tuned specifically per portal dataset and search query distribution. This provides an automated, data-driven way to customize and improve ACS search instead of manual heuristics.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes optimizing the weights of various fields in Azure Cognitive Search to improve search relevance. What is the intuition behind tweaking these weights to improve relevance? How does changing the weights impact ranking of search results?

2. The paper uses click-through rate (CTR) as a proxy for measuring search relevance. What are some potential issues with using CTR? Could there be other metrics better suited for measuring relevance?

3. The method relies on gathering historical CTR data for different query-document pairs. What factors need to be considered in terms of data quality and quantity to ensure the optimization process is robust? 

4. Bayesian optimization is used to find the optimal weights. Walk through the steps of how Bayesian optimization works. What are the advantages of using this over other optimization techniques?

5. The objective function is a weighted average of nDCG scores for different queries. Explain why using search frequency as the query weights is an appropriate choice. How else could the final objective function be constructed?

6. The results show a lift in nDCG after optimization. Why is nDCG an appropriate metric to compare search performance? What other evaluation metrics could complement nDCG?

7. The paper demonstrates improved ranking for some example queries after optimization. Analyze these examples and explain why the optimized rankings are more relevant.

8. The method customizes the search configuration for specific portals based on their data. How would you determine if the same configuration could work across multiple portals? What factors differ across portals?

9. The performance improvement from offline evaluation doesn't fully match the online AB test. Speculate on what could cause this discrepancy and how it could be mitigated.

10. The paper focuses on improving relevance which is one component of search quality. What other aspects like freshness, diversity, etc. could be incorporated into the optimization framework? How would the method need to change?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) is used to power search in Microsoft's AppSource and Azure portals. However, search relevance is poor due to use of default ACS configurations rather than customization for each portal's specific data and use cases. 

- Improving search relevance in these commercial marketplaces is critical to help visitors discover products and solutions, impacting business success.

Proposed Solution:
- Formulate the search relevance optimization problem as a Bayesian hyperparameter tuning task. Treat the ACS field weights and boosting values as hyperparameters and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) as the objective function to maximize.

- Gather historical click-through rate data for queries and products to estimate relevance and populate a large matrix. Use this to calculate nDCG. 

- Employ Bayesian optimization with Optuna to efficiently search the space of possible ACS configurations and find the settings that maximize nDCG based on the historical data.

- Configuration optimized specifically for each portal's catalog, search patterns, etc. rather than one-size-fits-all default.

Results:
- Optimized ACS configuration improved nDCG by 9.7% on AppSource and 1.7% on Azure portal over default settings.

- Live A/B testing showed over 1% lift in click-through rate.

- Qualitative examples demonstrate optimized search returning more relevant results to queries.

Main Contributions:
- Novel formulation to optimize search engine configurations as a Bayesian hyperparameter tuning problem
- Data-driven portal-specific customization approach vs default settings
- Quantified relevance gains in both nDCG offline and CTR in live testing
- Methodology generic enough to apply to other ACS use cases
