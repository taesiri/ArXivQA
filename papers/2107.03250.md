# [Understanding Intrinsic Robustness Using Label Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03250)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is:

How can we improve estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit for image classification tasks by incorporating label information? 

The paper argues that prior work estimating intrinsic robustness through concentration of measure fails to account for label information, which is critical for supervised learning tasks like image classification. To address this limitation, the paper proposes incorporating a "label uncertainty" measure when estimating concentration. The central hypothesis is that accounting for label uncertainty will lead to more accurate estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit compared to just considering input geometry/concentration.

In summary, the key research question is how to better estimate the intrinsic robustness limit for image classification by incorporating label information, in particular through a proposed label uncertainty measure. The central hypothesis is that this will improve the accuracy of intrinsic robustness estimates compared to prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying the insufficiency of standard concentration of measure for characterizing the intrinsic robustness limit of a classification problem. The paper argues that standard concentration ignores the label information which is essential for supervised learning tasks.

2. Proposing the notion of "label uncertainty" to quantify the average uncertainty in the label assignments for a subset of inputs. 

3. Incorporating label uncertainty into the standard concentration measure to obtain a more realistic intrinsic robustness characterization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10H datasets demonstrate that error regions of state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty.

4. Developing an empirical estimator for the proposed label uncertainty constrained concentration function. Compared to prior methods, this approach provides a tighter intrinsic robustness limit for benchmark image classification tasks.

5. Demonstrating the possibility of improving classifier robustness by abstaining on inputs with high label uncertainty. Both clean and robust accuracy increase as more uncertain examples are abstained.

In summary, the key innovation is incorporating label information into the notion of intrinsic robustness through the proposed label uncertainty measure. This better captures the difficulty of a classification problem and leads to more accurate intrinsic robustness estimates. The results also suggest abstaining on uncertain inputs as a potential defense method.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, here is a brief comparison of this paper to other related work in understanding adversarial robustness limits:

- This paper argues that standard concentration of measure is insufficient for characterizing intrinsic robustness, because it ignores label information which is essential for classification tasks. Previous works like Gilmer et al. (2018), Mahloujifar et al. (2019), Prescott et al. (2021) all rely on standard concentration to derive intrinsic robustness limits. 

- To address this limitation, the paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty in measuring concentration. This is a novel perspective not considered in prior works on concentration-based intrinsic robustness limits. The notion of label uncertainty provides a principled way to account for label information.

- The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical estimation for the proposed label uncertainty constrained concentration measure. The theoretical results connect the new concentration function with intrinsic robustness, extending analogous results from Mahloujifar et al. (2019). The concentration estimation algorithm adapts the method in Mahloujifar et al. (2019) to optimize for high label uncertainty regions.

- Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed label uncertainty based intrinsic robustness estimates are significantly lower than limits based on standard concentration, and align better with robust accuracies achieved by state-of-the-art classifiers. This supports the claim that label uncertainty helps capture a more realistic intrinsic limit.

- Overall, the key novelty is in highlighting the importance of label information for characterizing robustness limits. The proposed incorporation of label uncertainty allows more accurate estimation of intrinsic robustness compared to prior concentration-based approaches. The insights on label uncertainty are applicable more broadly to understanding adversarial vulnerability.

In summary, this paper makes an important conceptual contribution on the role of labels in robustness limits. The label uncertainty measure and resulting analysis substantially advance the state-of-the-art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to estimate label uncertainty when human annotation is not available. The authors' proposed approach relies on having human-annotated soft labels to estimate label uncertainty. They discuss using confident learning methods to try to automatically identify examples with high label uncertainty, but find this does not correlate well with human judgment. Improving methods to automatically identify uncertain inputs without human annotation could help extend their approach.

- Incorporating label uncertainty into algorithms for training robust models, rather than just using it for evaluation. The authors show that classification accuracy is related to label uncertainty on tested examples. They suggest abstaining on high uncertainty inputs could improve robustness. Developing training methods that explicitly model uncertainty could potentially improve robustness.

- Extending the analysis to more complex datasets and tasks beyond image classification. The empirical validation focuses on CIFAR-10. Applying similar analysis to more complex image datasets, as well as other modalities like audio or text could yield further insights.

- Tightening theoretical understanding and guarantees. The paper provides generalization analysis of the concentration estimation method, but there may be opportunities to strengthen the theoretical understanding. 

- Exploring other potential benefits of modeling label uncertainty. The paper focuses on connections to adversarial robustness, but understanding uncertainty may have other benefits for reliability, interpretability, fairness, etc.

In summary, key future directions relate to improving methods for estimating uncertainty without human labels, incorporating uncertainty modeling into algorithms, extending empirical analysis to new domains, strengthening theory, and exploring additional applications of uncertainty information. The introduction of label uncertainty is an interesting direction with many potential avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper argues that the standard concentration of measure problem is insufficient for characterizing the intrinsic robustness limit of classification problems. The standard concentration function ignores label information, which is essential for supervised learning tasks. The authors introduce a new notion of label uncertainty to capture the average uncertainty in the label assignments for a group of inputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that error regions induced by state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty compared to random input subsets. Based on this observation, the authors propose an empirical method to estimate a concentration function that incorporates a constraint on the label uncertainty of candidate input subsets. This yields lower and likely more accurate estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit on benchmark image datasets compared to prior work. The results suggest that the existence of inputs with uncertain labels, rather than just concentration of the input distribution, may explain the fundamental limitations on adversarial robustness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty into estimating the intrinsic robustness limit of classifiers. Previous work defined intrinsic robustness in terms of the concentration of measure of the input distribution. However, this ignores the label information which is essential for classification tasks. The authors introduce a notion of label uncertainty to capture the average uncertainty of label assignments for an input region. Experiments on CIFAR-10 datasets show that error regions of state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty than typical examples. 

Based on this observation, the authors adapt existing methods for estimating concentration to account for label uncertainty. They provide theoretical analysis showing this results in a tighter estimate of the intrinsic robustness. Experiments demonstrate their method produces significantly lower robustness limits than prior work, bringing the theoretical limit closer to the empirical robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers. The results suggest that uncertain inputs, rather than just concentration of measure, may explain fundamental limitations on adversarial robustness. The authors also show potential for improving classifier robustness by abstaining on high uncertainty inputs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method to estimate the intrinsic robustness limit of image classification tasks by incorporating label uncertainty. The key ideas are:

1. The standard concentration of measure used in previous work ignores label information and thus fails to capture a realistic intrinsic robustness limit. 

2. The authors introduce the notion of label uncertainty to characterize the average uncertainty in the label assignments for a group of inputs.

3. They incorporate a constraint on the label uncertainty when estimating the concentration of measure empirically from data samples. Specifically, they search for the least expansive subset among regions with high label uncertainty.

4. This results in a more accurate estimate of the intrinsic robustness limit compared to prior work. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show their method produces lower robustness estimates that better match the performance of state-of-the-art robust classifiers.

5. They also show classification accuracy is correlated with label uncertainty, suggesting an "abstain" option could improve robustness.

In summary, the key innovation is constraining the concentration estimation problem using label uncertainty, which enables a more realistic intrinsic robustness limit that considers the joint distribution of inputs and labels. Experiments demonstrate the utility of this method on image classification tasks.

## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It argues that the standard notion of concentration of measure is insufficient for characterizing the intrinsic robustness limit of classifiers against adversarial examples. The standard concentration function only considers the input metric space and ignores the labeling information, which is essential for supervised learning problems. 

- The paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty into estimating the intrinsic robustness limit. It defines label uncertainty to capture the average ambiguity/uncertainty of the label assignments for a set of inputs. 

- It hypothesizes that the error regions induced by classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty than random subsets, and provides empirical validation of this on CIFAR-10 using both standard and adversarially trained models.

- It develops an algorithm to estimate the concentration of measure while constraining the search to regions with high label uncertainty. Theoretical analysis shows this empirical estimate will converge to the true constrained concentration function.

- Experiments demonstrate the proposed method produces lower and likely more realistic estimates of intrinsic robustness for CIFAR-10 compared to prior work. The gap between these new estimates and the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers suggests label uncertainty may explain adversarial vulnerability more than concentration of measure.

- Analysis of abstaining based on label uncertainty indicates this could improve classifier robustness, suggesting uncertainty-based abstention is a promising direction.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying limitations of standard concentration of measure for characterizing intrinsic robustness, and showing both theoretically and empirically that incorporating label uncertainty information enables more accurate estimation of fundamental robustness limits. The results also suggest label uncertainty is an important factor in adversarial vulnerability.
