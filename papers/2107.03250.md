# [Understanding Intrinsic Robustness Using Label Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03250)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key research question addressed in this paper is:

How can we improve estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit for image classification tasks by incorporating label information? 

The paper argues that prior work estimating intrinsic robustness through concentration of measure fails to account for label information, which is critical for supervised learning tasks like image classification. To address this limitation, the paper proposes incorporating a "label uncertainty" measure when estimating concentration. The central hypothesis is that accounting for label uncertainty will lead to more accurate estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit compared to just considering input geometry/concentration.

In summary, the key research question is how to better estimate the intrinsic robustness limit for image classification by incorporating label information, in particular through a proposed label uncertainty measure. The central hypothesis is that this will improve the accuracy of intrinsic robustness estimates compared to prior work.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Identifying the insufficiency of standard concentration of measure for characterizing the intrinsic robustness limit of a classification problem. The paper argues that standard concentration ignores the label information which is essential for supervised learning tasks.

2. Proposing the notion of "label uncertainty" to quantify the average uncertainty in the label assignments for a subset of inputs. 

3. Incorporating label uncertainty into the standard concentration measure to obtain a more realistic intrinsic robustness characterization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10H datasets demonstrate that error regions of state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty.

4. Developing an empirical estimator for the proposed label uncertainty constrained concentration function. Compared to prior methods, this approach provides a tighter intrinsic robustness limit for benchmark image classification tasks.

5. Demonstrating the possibility of improving classifier robustness by abstaining on inputs with high label uncertainty. Both clean and robust accuracy increase as more uncertain examples are abstained.

In summary, the key innovation is incorporating label information into the notion of intrinsic robustness through the proposed label uncertainty measure. This better captures the difficulty of a classification problem and leads to more accurate intrinsic robustness estimates. The results also suggest abstaining on uncertain inputs as a potential defense method.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading, here is a brief comparison of this paper to other related work in understanding adversarial robustness limits:

- This paper argues that standard concentration of measure is insufficient for characterizing intrinsic robustness, because it ignores label information which is essential for classification tasks. Previous works like Gilmer et al. (2018), Mahloujifar et al. (2019), Prescott et al. (2021) all rely on standard concentration to derive intrinsic robustness limits. 

- To address this limitation, the paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty in measuring concentration. This is a novel perspective not considered in prior works on concentration-based intrinsic robustness limits. The notion of label uncertainty provides a principled way to account for label information.

- The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical estimation for the proposed label uncertainty constrained concentration measure. The theoretical results connect the new concentration function with intrinsic robustness, extending analogous results from Mahloujifar et al. (2019). The concentration estimation algorithm adapts the method in Mahloujifar et al. (2019) to optimize for high label uncertainty regions.

- Experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed label uncertainty based intrinsic robustness estimates are significantly lower than limits based on standard concentration, and align better with robust accuracies achieved by state-of-the-art classifiers. This supports the claim that label uncertainty helps capture a more realistic intrinsic limit.

- Overall, the key novelty is in highlighting the importance of label information for characterizing robustness limits. The proposed incorporation of label uncertainty allows more accurate estimation of intrinsic robustness compared to prior concentration-based approaches. The insights on label uncertainty are applicable more broadly to understanding adversarial vulnerability.

In summary, this paper makes an important conceptual contribution on the role of labels in robustness limits. The label uncertainty measure and resulting analysis substantially advance the state-of-the-art in this area.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing methods to estimate label uncertainty when human annotation is not available. The authors' proposed approach relies on having human-annotated soft labels to estimate label uncertainty. They discuss using confident learning methods to try to automatically identify examples with high label uncertainty, but find this does not correlate well with human judgment. Improving methods to automatically identify uncertain inputs without human annotation could help extend their approach.

- Incorporating label uncertainty into algorithms for training robust models, rather than just using it for evaluation. The authors show that classification accuracy is related to label uncertainty on tested examples. They suggest abstaining on high uncertainty inputs could improve robustness. Developing training methods that explicitly model uncertainty could potentially improve robustness.

- Extending the analysis to more complex datasets and tasks beyond image classification. The empirical validation focuses on CIFAR-10. Applying similar analysis to more complex image datasets, as well as other modalities like audio or text could yield further insights.

- Tightening theoretical understanding and guarantees. The paper provides generalization analysis of the concentration estimation method, but there may be opportunities to strengthen the theoretical understanding. 

- Exploring other potential benefits of modeling label uncertainty. The paper focuses on connections to adversarial robustness, but understanding uncertainty may have other benefits for reliability, interpretability, fairness, etc.

In summary, key future directions relate to improving methods for estimating uncertainty without human labels, incorporating uncertainty modeling into algorithms, extending empirical analysis to new domains, strengthening theory, and exploring additional applications of uncertainty information. The introduction of label uncertainty is an interesting direction with many potential avenues for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper argues that the standard concentration of measure problem is insufficient for characterizing the intrinsic robustness limit of classification problems. The standard concentration function ignores label information, which is essential for supervised learning tasks. The authors introduce a new notion of label uncertainty to capture the average uncertainty in the label assignments for a group of inputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that error regions induced by state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty compared to random input subsets. Based on this observation, the authors propose an empirical method to estimate a concentration function that incorporates a constraint on the label uncertainty of candidate input subsets. This yields lower and likely more accurate estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit on benchmark image datasets compared to prior work. The results suggest that the existence of inputs with uncertain labels, rather than just concentration of the input distribution, may explain the fundamental limitations on adversarial robustness.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty into estimating the intrinsic robustness limit of classifiers. Previous work defined intrinsic robustness in terms of the concentration of measure of the input distribution. However, this ignores the label information which is essential for classification tasks. The authors introduce a notion of label uncertainty to capture the average uncertainty of label assignments for an input region. Experiments on CIFAR-10 datasets show that error regions of state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty than typical examples. 

Based on this observation, the authors adapt existing methods for estimating concentration to account for label uncertainty. They provide theoretical analysis showing this results in a tighter estimate of the intrinsic robustness. Experiments demonstrate their method produces significantly lower robustness limits than prior work, bringing the theoretical limit closer to the empirical robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers. The results suggest that uncertain inputs, rather than just concentration of measure, may explain fundamental limitations on adversarial robustness. The authors also show potential for improving classifier robustness by abstaining on high uncertainty inputs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a new method to estimate the intrinsic robustness limit of image classification tasks by incorporating label uncertainty. The key ideas are:

1. The standard concentration of measure used in previous work ignores label information and thus fails to capture a realistic intrinsic robustness limit. 

2. The authors introduce the notion of label uncertainty to characterize the average uncertainty in the label assignments for a group of inputs.

3. They incorporate a constraint on the label uncertainty when estimating the concentration of measure empirically from data samples. Specifically, they search for the least expansive subset among regions with high label uncertainty.

4. This results in a more accurate estimate of the intrinsic robustness limit compared to prior work. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show their method produces lower robustness estimates that better match the performance of state-of-the-art robust classifiers.

5. They also show classification accuracy is correlated with label uncertainty, suggesting an "abstain" option could improve robustness.

In summary, the key innovation is constraining the concentration estimation problem using label uncertainty, which enables a more realistic intrinsic robustness limit that considers the joint distribution of inputs and labels. Experiments demonstrate the utility of this method on image classification tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a brief 1-sentence summary of the key points in the paper: 

The paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty into estimates of the intrinsic robustness limit for classification tasks, arguing this results in more accurate robustness bounds compared to prior work that only considered input geometry.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- It argues that the standard notion of concentration of measure is insufficient for characterizing the intrinsic robustness limit of classifiers against adversarial examples. The standard concentration function only considers the input metric space and ignores the labeling information, which is essential for supervised learning problems. 

- The paper proposes incorporating label uncertainty into estimating the intrinsic robustness limit. It defines label uncertainty to capture the average ambiguity/uncertainty of the label assignments for a set of inputs. 

- It hypothesizes that the error regions induced by classifiers tend to have higher label uncertainty than random subsets, and provides empirical validation of this on CIFAR-10 using both standard and adversarially trained models.

- It develops an algorithm to estimate the concentration of measure while constraining the search to regions with high label uncertainty. Theoretical analysis shows this empirical estimate will converge to the true constrained concentration function.

- Experiments demonstrate the proposed method produces lower and likely more realistic estimates of intrinsic robustness for CIFAR-10 compared to prior work. The gap between these new estimates and the robustness of state-of-the-art classifiers suggests label uncertainty may explain adversarial vulnerability more than concentration of measure.

- Analysis of abstaining based on label uncertainty indicates this could improve classifier robustness, suggesting uncertainty-based abstention is a promising direction.

In summary, the key contribution is identifying limitations of standard concentration of measure for characterizing intrinsic robustness, and showing both theoretically and empirically that incorporating label uncertainty information enables more accurate estimation of fundamental robustness limits. The results also suggest label uncertainty is an important factor in adversarial vulnerability.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a new notion of label uncertainty to account for the underlying class label information when estimating the intrinsic robustness limit for a classification task. The authors argue that standard concentration of measure is insufficient to characterize intrinsic robustness, as it ignores the joint distribution of inputs and labels which is essential for classification. They first define label uncertainty to capture the average uncertainty in label assignments for a set of inputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that error regions of state-of-the-art classifiers tend to have much higher label uncertainty than random subsets, motivating the authors to incorporate label uncertainty constraints into concentration estimation.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that standard concentration fails to capture intrinsic robustness since it ignores label information. However, couldn't the concentration function be extended to incorporate labels, instead of proposing a new approach based on label uncertainty? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of modifying the concentration function itself to account for labels?

2. The definition of label uncertainty seems intuitive, but is there any theoretical justification for using that specific formula? Have the authors experimented with other definitions or variants of label uncertainty?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on the abstract and introduction, this paper aims to verify the strong BSD conjecture for certain absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of genus 2 curves obtained as Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). Specifically, it shows that the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial for 28 such surfaces. The key hypotheses that enable proving this are:

- The surfaces are modular, so their L-functions are known and satisfy the analytic continuation and functional equation. 

- They are absolutely simple, so associated to a single newform.

- The newforms have analytic rank 0 or 1, so the weak BSD conjecture is known. 

- The residual Galois representations are irreducible for almost all primes.

The main tools used are:

- Computing the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group.

- Determining the image of residual Galois representations. 

- Computing the Heegner index.

- Bounding and computing Selmer groups using isogeny descent. 

- Verifying cases of the Iwasawa main conjecture using $p$-adic L-functions.

By combining these, the paper is able to show the Shafarevich-Tate group is finite of order equal to the analytic prediction, and hence trivial. This verifies the strong BSD conjecture for these 28 surfaces.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture, which predicts the size of the Shafarevich-Tate group, for certain absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces over the rational numbers by showing this group is trivial.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research on verifying the BSD conjecture:

- This paper focuses specifically on verifying the strong BSD conjecture for absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of genus 2 curves. Much previous work has focused on verifying BSD for elliptic curves, so this extends the techniques to higher dimensional abelian varieties.

- The paper relies heavily on the methods of Kolyvagin and Logachev for bounding the size of Shafarevich-Tate groups using Heegner points. These techniques have been widely used in other work on BSD as well. 

- The paper makes significant use of algorithms and software like Magma to carry out explicit computations. Other recent work verifying BSD, like the work of Jetchev et al., has also emphasized the computational side.

- The paper verifies BSD in some new cases by handling all the absolutely simple Jacobians of Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N) curves of genus 2. Previous computational work had verified the analytic order of Sha for most of these curves, so this completes the proof.

- The techniques used seem fairly standard for BSD work nowadays - Heegner points, Kolyvagin methods, Magma algorithms, etc. So this paper extends the state of the art in a natural way, rather than introducing brand new techniques.

Overall, this seems like an incremental but solid contribution, continuing along a research program of verifying BSD in new cases using the latest algorithms and software. The focus on genus 2 curves is novel, but the methods are fairly conventional. It would mainly be of interest to researchers working on BSD, computational number theory, and explicit calculations with modular forms.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Extending the computations to additional absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are not Jacobians of Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). The authors plan to consider some further two-dimensional absolutely simple isogeny factors of J_0(N).

- Investigating whether their algorithms and results can be extended to higher genus modular curves and their Jacobians. The methods presented focus on genus 2 curves, so studying if they generalize is an open question.

- Exploring connections to the integral Iwasawa main conjecture and fine Selmer groups. The authors indicate their computation of the p-adic L-functions gives information about Selmer groups assuming the IMC, so further study of the IMC and fine Selmer groups could yield more insights.

- Considering analogues and generalizations over other number fields besides Q. The strong BSD conjecture and construction of Heegner points extends more broadly, so extending the computations to modular abelian varieties over other number fields is a natural direction.

- Optimizing the algorithms and implementation to handle more complex examples. As the authors note, optimizing their Magma implementation could allow tackling additional cases.

In summary, the main suggestions involve broadening the class of examples, generalizing to higher genus curves, studying finer arithmetic invariants like Selmer groups, and extending the setting from Q to other global fields. Improving the algorithms is also noted as beneficial for handling more complicated cases going forward.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an exact verification of the strong Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture for some absolutely simple abelian surfaces that are modular. Specifically:

- The paper considers the Jacobians of 28 genus 2 curves that arise as Atkin-Lehner quotients of modular curves X_0(N). 

- It is shown that the Mordell-Weil rank equals the analytic rank predicted by the L-function, verifying the weak BSD conjecture. 

- The key new result is that the Shafarevich-Tate group of these Jacobians is trivial. This verifies the full strong BSD conjecture, including the agreement of the algebraic and analytic orders of the Shafarevich-Tate group.

- The methods involve computing Heegner points to get information about the rank, studying the residual Galois representations to handle the primes where the Jacobian has bad reduction, and computing the p-adic L-functions in the squarefree level cases.

In summary, the paper completes the proof of the strong BSD conjecture for these 28 Jacobians by showing the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial, building on extensive prior work determining the analytic ranks and studying the 2-primary part of the Shafarevich-Tate group. This provides an important advance in our knowledge of BSD for higher dimensional modular abelian varieties.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture for the absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of 28 specific genus 2 curves obtained as Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). Using algorithms implemented in Magma, the authors show the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group is 1 for each of these 28 Jacobians. They determine the image of residual Galois representations to handle the cases where the representation is reducible. By computing Heegner points and indices, they find the odd part of the Heegner index divides the Tamagawa product in each case. Combined with the triviality of the 2-primary part from 2-descent, this implies the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial in all cases, completing the verification of strong BSD.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture for the Jacobian varieties of 28 absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that arise as quotients of modular curves X_0(N) by Atkin-Lehner involutions. The strong BSD conjecture asserts that the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group matches its actual size. 

The paper first shows the 2-primary part of the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial using 2-descent. For the odd primes p where the Galois representation is reducible, isogeny descent is used to show the p-primary part is also trivial. For the remaining cases, the analytic order of Sha is computed and shown to be 1. By checking the Heegner index is coprime to the bad primes and Tamagawa numbers, this implies Sha is finite and trivial, verifying strong BSD. The computations rely on algorithms to determine residual Galois representations, endomorphism rings, Heegner points and indices, p-adic L-functions, and analytic Sha.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The main method used in this paper is to combine various computational techniques to verify the strong BSD conjecture for certain absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces over Q. The key steps are:

1. Use algorithms to compute the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group Sha(A/Q)_an and check that it is an integer. 

2. Determine that Sha(A/Q)[2] = 0 using 2-descent on the hyperelliptic curves.

3. For odd primes p, use algorithms to determine if the residual Galois representations ρ_℘ are reducible. If so, use isogeny descent methods to show Sha(A/Q)[℘] = 0. 

4. For the remaining primes, use a combination of computing Heegner points, Heegner indices, and local conditions to apply results of Kolyvagin-Logachev to deduce Sha(A/Q)[℘] = 0.

5. Conclude that Sha(A/Q) is finite and compute its order by combining the previous steps. This verifies the strong BSD conjecture by showing the analytic order equals the algebraic order of Sha(A/Q).

In summary, the main method combines computational techniques for analyzing L-functions, Galois representations, Heegner points, and descent on Jacobians to exactly determine the Shafarevich-Tate group and verify strong BSD for these surfaces.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on the abstract, this paper is addressing the strong BSD conjecture for certain absolutely simple abelian surfaces that are modular. Specifically, it is considering the jacobian varieties of 28 genus 2 curves that arise as Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N) for various N. The main goal is to verify that the Shafarevich-Tate group of these jacobian varieties is finite and trivial, thereby confirming the strong BSD conjecture in these cases.

The key points made in the abstract are:

- The paper focuses on 28 specific jacobian varieties coming from genus 2 curves that are Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). 

- These jacobian varieties are absolutely simple.

- The paper shows the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial for all of these jacobian varieties.

- This verifies the strong BSD conjecture for these cases.

So in summary, the main problem is confirming the strong BSD conjecture for these 28 special cases of absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces. The paper does this by showing the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial in all these cases.

10. How well are the methods expected to scale to verifying BSD for higher-dimensional abelian varieties, such as absolutely simple factors of J0(N) of dimension >2? What new challenges arise?

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture for 28 absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N) with genus 2. The authors first compute the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group Sha(J/Q) and confirm it is 1 in all cases. They then use a combination of methods, including 2-descent, determining the image of residual Galois representations, computing Heegner indices, and isogeny descent, to show Sha(J/Q) is finite and trivial in all cases. This completes the verification of the strong BSD conjecture for these surfaces, complementing previous computational work verifying BSD for elliptic curves. The results rely crucially on the surfaces having CM, ensuring the weak BSD theorem holds, and on being able to leverage properties of their modular parametrization.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture for the absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that are Jacobians of Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N) with genus 2 by showing the Shafarevich-Tate group is trivial in each case.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture for 28 absolutely simple modular abelian surfaces that arise as Jacobians of genus 2 curves obtained as Atkin-Lehner quotients of X_0(N). The authors use a combination of analytic, algebraic, and computational techniques, including computing residual Galois representations, Heegner points, endomorphism rings, analytic orders of Shafarevich-Tate groups, and Selmer groups. For each surface, they are able to show that the Shafarevich-Tate group is finite and its order equals the analytic prediction, thereby confirming the strong BSD conjecture in these cases. The computations rely crucially on the surfaces having real multiplication and on results of Gross-Zagier, Kolyvagin, and others relating Heegner points to Mordell-Weil and Shafarevich-Tate groups. This provides an explicit verification of BSD in new cases of higher-dimensional abelian varieties over Q.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper verifies the strong BSD conjecture for certain modular abelian surfaces by showing that their Shafarevich-Tate groups are trivial. What are some of the main challenges in computing Shafarevich-Tate groups and why is it difficult to show they are finite or trivial?

2. The paper relies on combining results from Gross-Zagier, Kolyvagin, and others to relate Heegner points to the analytic Sha. What are the key assumptions needed for these results to apply and how does the paper ensure they are satisfied? 

3. For reducible residual representations ρ_℘, the paper uses isogeny descent to bound the dimensions of ℘-Selmer groups. Can you explain this technique in more detail? What are its limitations?

4. The computation of the Heegner index I_D is crucial. What are the main steps in computing it in practice? What could go wrong in this computation? 

5. The paper determines endomorphism rings and uses them to compute I_D and find characters associated to reducible ρ_℘. What are the main algorithms for computing endomorphism rings and their limitations?

6. Tamagawa numbers play an important role in the analytic computations. What techniques are used to compute them and why can they be difficult to determine in some cases?

7. How does the computation of p-adic L-functions provide evidence for the triviality of Sha[℘]? What assumptions are needed to deduce this from Iwasawa theory results?

8. The paper relies heavily on residual Galois representations ρ_℘. What are some of the main techniques for studying these representations and how does the paper use them? 

9. What challenges arise in generalizing these computations to non-Jacobian modular abelian varieties that are not quotients of J0(N)?

10. How difficult is it to extend these results to abelian threefolds or higher dimensional modular abelian varieties? What new issues arise there?
