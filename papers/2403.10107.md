# [Enhancing Human-Centered Dynamic Scene Understanding via Multiple LLMs   Collaborated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10107)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Video-based human-object interaction (V-HOI) detection is an important task for understanding dynamic scenes involving people and objects. However, existing V-HOI models lack human-like reasoning abilities and can make incorrect predictions that violate common sense or spatio-temporal consistency. 

Proposed Solution - V-HOI MLCR:  
- Proposes a novel framework called V-HOI Multi-LLMs Collaborated Reasoning (V-HOI MLCR) that collaborates state-of-the-art V-HOI models with multiple pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning.
- Has two main stages: 
   1) Cross-Agents Reasoning: Uses each LLM as an agent to check prediction rationality from different aspects (common sense, spatial, temporal) and provide confidence scores.  
   2) Multi-LLMs Debate: Aggregates responses from the LLMs through a debate format to refine the predictions.
- Also proposes an auxiliary training strategy using CLIP to enhance discrimination ability of base V-HOI models.

Main Contributions:
- Explores using multiple LLMs to facilitate reasoning for V-HOI detection.
- Introduces the V-HOI MLCR framework that can enhance current V-HOI models via collaborated reasoning from diverse LLMs.  
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance improvements on two benchmark V-HOI datasets by equipping models with the proposed framework.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to enhance dynamic scene understanding by collaborating V-HOI models with multiple LLMs to perform multi-aspect reasoning and refinement of predictions. The proposed V-HOI MLCR framework is shown effective at correcting errors and improving detection accuracy.
