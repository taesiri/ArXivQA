# [DreamFusion: Text-to-3D using 2D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14988)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on the abstract, it seems this paper introduces a new method called DreamFusion for generating 3D models from text descriptions using a pretrained 2D image diffusion model. The key ideas appear to be:- Leveraging a 2D image diffusion model as a prior/loss function to optimize a 3D model (parameterized as a neural radiance field or NeRF) such that its rendered 2D views match the text description. This allows transferring knowledge from large scale 2D image training to 3D without requiring labeled 3D data.- Introducing a novel loss function called score distillation sampling that enables sampling via optimization in differentiable image parameterizations like NeRFs. This loss minimizes a KL divergence between Gaussian distributions based on the diffusion model's predicted score functions.- Showing that this approach can generate coherent 3D objects and scenes from a wide variety of textual prompts without any 3D training data or modifications to the 2D image diffusion model.So in summary, the central hypothesis seems to be that pretrained 2D image diffusion models can act as effective priors for generating 3D content from text, even though they were only trained on 2D image data. The key contribution is a method to successfully transfer these powerful 2D models to 3D synthesis through an optimization process guided by the proposed score distillation sampling loss.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on the abstract, it seems like the main contributions of this paper are:1. Introducing a novel text-to-3D synthesis approach called DreamFusion that leverages pretrained 2D image diffusion models like Imagen to generate 3D assets, without requiring any 3D training data.2. Proposing a loss function based on probability density distillation that allows optimizing in the space of differentiable image generators (like NeRFs) to match the score functions learned by the 2D diffusion model. This enables using the diffusion model to guide optimization of the image generator parameters.3. Demonstrating high quality and diverse 3D object generation from text prompts using DreamFusion. The results showcase the ability to generate coherent 3D objects that can be rendered with realistic shading/lighting from arbitrary viewpoints.4. Showing that large pretrained 2D image diffusion models can be effectively transferred to 3D tasks through the proposed distillation loss, without needing access to the model internals or retraining on 3D data.In summary, the key ideas are leveraging powerful 2D image diffusion models for 3D tasks without 3D data, and introducing a novel distillation-based loss that allows optimizing in the space of differentiable image generators to match the score functions from the diffusion model. The results validate the effectiveness of this approach for high quality text-to-3D generation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel approach to generating realistic 3D objects from text descriptions using a pretrained 2D image diffusion model, without requiring any 3D training data, by optimizing the parameters of a neural radiance field scene representation based on a probability density distillation loss derived from the image diffusion model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of text-to-3D generation:- The key novelty of the paper is using 2D text-to-image diffusion models for 3D synthesis, without requiring 3D training data. This is unique compared to prior work like Dream Fields and CLIP-Mesh that rely on 3D representations and optimization objectives. The idea of transferring powerful 2D generative models to other domains is promising.- The paper builds on recent successes in text-to-image diffusion models like DALL-E and Imagen that have shown incredible results by training on massive image-text datasets. Adapting this approach to 3D is clever, but also highlights current challenges - lack of large 3D datasets, and inefficient 3D neural rendering models compared to 2D CNNs.- Compared to other zero-shot text-to-3D approaches, DreamFusion demonstrates more accurate and higher fidelity results on a diverse set of object and scene types. The paper shows both quantitative evaluations and compelling qualitative results. However, metrics comparing to ground truth 3D data are lacking since text-to-3D is inherently ambiguous.- A downside is that the approach requires optimizing a NeRF model from scratch each time, which is slow. So it lacks the generalization of feedforward networks. Combining the strengths of this optimization approach with more efficient neural 3D representations could be impactful.- Overall, the work is exciting in pushing the boundaries of what is possible in text-to-3D generation without 3D supervision. It suggests powerful priors are learnable from 2D data alone. However, metrics are limited and scale is a challenge. Integrating the approach into conditional 3D generative models once more 3D data is available could be an interesting direction for future work.In summary, the paper introduces a novel technique and demonstrates promising results, but is mainly proof-of-concept at this stage given the efficiency and evaluation limitations. Building on these ideas to scale up and robustly evaluate text-to-3D models will be important future work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:- Developing more efficient 3D representations and rendering techniques to enable high-resolution 3D synthesis. The current approach is limited to low resolution due to the computational costs.- Improving diversity across random seeds. The proposed method tends to yield similar outputs across seeds due to the mode-seeking nature of the loss function. Exploring different losses or noise schedules may help improve diversity.- Using more robust 3D priors to help resolve inherent ambiguities in inferring 3D from 2D. The ill-posed inverse rendering problem remains challenging.- Scaling up to larger 3D datasets once available. The current approach uses only a pretrained 2D image diffusion model. Training an end-to-end 3D diffusion model may improve results if large 3D datasets become available.- Addressing potential negative social impacts of generative 3D models, such as spreading disinformation or displacing creative workers. More research is needed on the ethical implications.- Exploring other potential applications of the proposed techniques, such as few-shot 3D modeling, interactive 3D editing, or refinement of 3D scanned data.In summary, the main future directions are developing more efficient and higher-resolution 3D modeling techniques, improving output diversity, using more powerful 3D priors, scaling up with more 3D data, addressing ethical concerns, and exploring other useful applications that may benefit from the proposed approach. The core technical thrust is moving towards end-to-end 3D generative modeling once 3D datasets, compute, and algorithms catches up to the current 2D state-of-the-art.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper introduces DreamFusion, a method for generating 3D models from text prompts using a pretrained 2D image diffusion model. DreamFusion represents the 3D scene as a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and renders it from random viewpoints during optimization. It computes a loss on these renderings using the frozen image diffusion model, based on a novel probability density distillation loss called Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This enables sampling in the continuous space of the NeRF parameters rather than just pixel space. By optimizing the NeRF parameters using gradients from this loss, high quality 3D models can be synthesized from scratch based on a text prompt, without requiring 3D training data. The key innovations are the SDS loss allowing sampling in parameter space, and use of a pretrained 2D diffusion model as a prior, transferring knowledge to 3D synthesis. Experiments show DreamFusion generates better 3D geometry than prior work on text-to-3D generation using CLIP.
