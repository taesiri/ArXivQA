# [SOLAR 10.7B: Scaling Large Language Models with Simple yet Effective   Depth Up-Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15166)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Scaling up large language models (LLMs) efficiently is challenging. Methods like mixture-of-experts (MoE) require complex changes to the training and inference frameworks.  
- There is a need for a simple yet effective approach to scale up LLMs while retaining ease of use and integration with existing frameworks.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel depth up-scaling (DUS) technique to efficiently scale up LLMs in a simple manner. 
- DUS takes a base LLM architecture, makes a copy, removes some layers from both copies and concatenates them to form an up-scaled model with more layers and parameters. This allows reusing pretrained weights from the base model.
- DUS models can leverage existing training pipelines and frameworks like HuggingFace without any customization, unlike MoE models.

Key Outcomes:
- Using DUS, the authors build SOLAR-10.7B, an 11 billion parameter LLM which outperforms models like Llama-2 and Mistral-7B on various NLP benchmarks.
- They also develop SOLAR-10.7B-Instruct, a variant fine-tuned for instruction following, which beats the much larger Mixtral-8x7B model.
- DUS provides an effective way to scale up LLMs while retaining simplicity in usage compared to other techniques like MoE.
- The open-sourced release of SOLAR-10.7B promotes wider access and advances innovation in large language modeling research.

Main Contributions:
- Novel DUS method for effectively and efficiently scaling LLMs
- Introduction of SOLAR-10.7B, the world's first open-sourced 11 billion parameter LLM
- State-of-the-art performance of SOLAR models across diverse NLP benchmarks 
- Enhanced instruction tuning capabilities in SOLAR-Instruct variant
- Promoting collaborative research via open-source release under Apache 2.0 license

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions in efficiently scaling up LLMs using the proposed DUS technique. The resulting SOLAR models demonstrate advanced performance coupled with ease of use due to compatibility with existing frameworks. The open-source availability also enables wider applications in the research community.
