# [VitalLens: Take A Vital Selfie](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) uses video of a person's face to estimate vital signs like heart rate and breathing rate. This has many potential health monitoring applications. Existing rPPG methods either use handcrafted algorithms which are fast but not very accurate, or machine learning models which are more accurate but slow. There is a need for an accurate rPPG method that can run in real-time on smartphones.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces VitalLens, a smartphone app that uses an efficient deep learning model to estimate heart rate and breathing rate from selfie videos in real-time. The model is trained on a large diverse dataset of video and ground truth physiological data.

Main Contributions:

- VitalLens app: First widely distributed rPPG app for real-time vitals estimation from selfies. Runs locally on device for privacy.

- Comprehensive evaluation: Tested on multiple datasets with over 1300 participants. VitalLens outperforms previous methods like POS and MTTS-CAN in accuracy, while maintaining fast 18ms inference time per video frame.

- Analysis of factors affecting performance: Participant movement and change in face illumination are main factors reducing accuracy. Inclusion of diverse training data reduces skin type bias.

- Dataset collection and model training: Collected diverse PROSIT dataset with 1400 participants. Combined with Vital Videos dataset to train model using over 1900 participants. Result is a robust model that works across demographics.

In summary, VitalLens enables accurate real-time estimation of vital signs from selfie videos by using an efficient deep learning model trained on a large diverse dataset. Key factors affecting performance are analyzed.
