# [Factors that Affect Personalization of Robots for Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17769)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- There is a growing need for assistive robots to help provide care and assistance to older adults, but designing appropriate interactions between robots and the complex caregiving ecosystem remains challenging. 
- Prior HRI research has focused on specific facets in isolation rather than taking a holistic view across the various stakeholders and environmental factors that shape interactions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce a taxonomy of important factors to consider when personalizing interactions with assistive robots in senior living facilities. 
- The taxonomy has 5 main categories: Primary User (Resident), Care Partners, Robot, Facility, External Circumstances.
- Each category contains detailed factors that impact different aspects of the human-robot interaction.

Contributions:
- Provides a preliminary taxonomy based on reflections from two field studies placing robots in a senior living facility.
- Taxonomy serves as a framework for researchers/designers to consider the range of factors that influence personalized assistive robot deployment.  
- Discusses how the taxonomy components relate to dynamic personalization over time as user needs/preferences change.
- Highlights conflicts between desires for personalization and constraints from robot capabilities or facility policies.
- Argues personalization should be viewed as an ongoing process rather than one-time configuration.

In summary, the paper makes an important contribution in framing the design space for personalized assistive robots and offering researchers/designers an initial set of contextual factors to consider when developing interactions.
