# [Admission Prediction in Undergraduate Applications: an Interpretable   Deep Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11698)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Undergraduate admission processes struggle to handle large volumes of applicants while ensuring fair and unbiased decisions. 
- Existing classical ML approaches for admission decisions lack scalability and have performance issues with large data.
- There is a need for interpretable and explainable ML models to ensure transparency and accountability.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose deep neural network models - Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) and Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) - for undergraduate admission predictions.
- The models are trained on applicant data with various features like demographics, academic records, test scores etc.  
- To improve interpretability, the authors incorporate LIME technique along with a gradient-based approach to explain model predictions.

Key Contributions:
- The FFNN and ICNN models achieve higher accuracy of 80.67%, outperforming best classical ML model by 3.03%.
- ICNN model has superior performance over FFNN on precision, recall, F1-score and AUROC metrics.
- Using LIME and gradients, positive and negative feature impacts on admission decisions are analyzed. Academic performance features positively influence decisions.
- The approach provides valuable insights into features affecting applicant evaluation, enhancing transparency and fairness.
- Future work is suggested for anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns and ensure reliable decisions.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models over classical ML approaches for undergraduate admission predictions. The incorporation of interpretability techniques also allows for an equitable and transparent admission process.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes deep learning models for undergraduate admission decisions that outperform classical ML approaches, and uses gradient-based feature selection and LIME interpretability to understand which application attributes positively or negatively impact admissions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing deep learning-based classifiers (Feed-Forward and Input Convex neural networks) for undergraduate admission decisions that overcome challenges like scalability and performance issues faced by existing methods when dealing with large volumes of applicant data.

2) Incorporating an interpretability module (LIME) with the deep learning models to provide insights into which features and applicant attributes most influence the admission decisions. This enhances transparency and fairness.

3) Evaluating the models on a dataset of 4,442 freshman applicant records to UC Irvine's Computer Science department. The models achieve higher accuracy (by over 3%) compared to the best performing traditional machine learning approach.

4) Using the LIME technique to analyze the sensitivity and relative impacts of different features on the overall admission decisions made by the models. This provides an understanding of what factors most sway the models' predictions.

In summary, the key contributions are proposing deep learning models for admission decisions that outperform traditional approaches, enhancing interpretability of the models using LIME, and evaluating performance comprehensively on a relevant dataset while analyzing how different features impact the predictions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using deep neural networks like Feedforward Neural Networks and Input Convex Neural Networks for undergraduate admission predictions. What are the key advantages of using these complex neural network architectures over classical machine learning models for this task?

2. The paper applies dimensionality reduction using PCA before training the neural networks. What is the motivation behind this? How does PCA help improve the performance and robustness of the models?

3. The Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) outperforms the Feedforward Neural Network on most metrics. What intrinsic properties of the ICNN architecture make it well-suited for classification tasks like undergraduate admission decisions?

4. The paper uses a gradient-based method for feature selection before applying the LIME technique. Why is this beneficial compared to using LIME directly on the entire feature set? How does it help tackle the limitation of local explanations in LIME?

5. What are the key features identified by the LIME analysis to positively influence admission decisions? How do these features align with the goals of holistic applicant review?

6. The ELC percentage score is found to negatively impact admission decisions. What does this feature represent and why does it demonstrate this behavior? What implications does this have on the fairness of the admissions process?  

7. Beyond model performance, what additional benefits can automated ML-based admission prediction systems provide to universities and applicants? How can transparency techniques like LIME further augment these benefits?

8. The paper does not use demographic features like gender and ethnicity owing to Proposition 209. How can interpretation techniques provide safeguards against algorithmic bias in such scenarios? 

9. What are some ways the proposed method can be extended to not just predict decisions, but also provide insights to improve equity and uphold holistic review values in admissions?

10. Anomaly detection is suggested as a future direction. What types of anomalies can occur in admission data and how can detecting these anomalies make admission systems more robust and fairer?
