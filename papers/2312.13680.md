# [HGE: Embedding Temporal Knowledge Graphs in a Product Space of   Heterogeneous Geometric Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13680)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) represent facts as quadruples (subject, predicate, object, time) that are valid over a time interval. 
- TKGs exhibit various temporal patterns such as symmetry, inverse, evolves, and temporary relations.
- Existing embedding methods use a single geometry like complex space to model TKGs which limits their ability to capture diverse temporal patterns.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a new embedding method called HGE that maps TKGs into a product space of heterogeneous geometric subspaces - complex, split-complex, and dual spaces.
- Each subspace geometry is suitable for modeling certain temporal patterns based on the unit circles induced by rotations.
- Introduce two novel attention mechanisms:
   - Temporal-relational attention to handle relations with varying rates of change  
   - Temporal-geometric attention to select suitable subspace geometries based on relational and temporal info.

Key Contributions:
- HGE embeds TKGs in a product space of multiple geometries to capture more diverse temporal patterns compared to using a single geometry.
- Theoretical analysis shows HGE can model symmetric, inverse, evolves and temporary temporal patterns.
- Temporal-relational and temporal-geometric attentions allow capturing static vs changing relations and best subspace geometry.
- Experiments on benchmark TKG datasets show HGE consistently improves state-of-the-art baselines.
- Ablation studies verify benefits of the heterogeneous geometry product space.

In summary, the key idea is to use a product space of multiple geometries along with temporal attentions to capture rich evolving temporal patterns in TKGs for better inference.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes HGE, a temporal knowledge graph embedding method that maps facts into a product space of heterogeneous geometric subspaces with temporal attention mechanisms to capture diverse temporal patterns.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It extends state-of-the-art temporal knowledge graph embedding (TKGE) models that use Complex spaces to a new method called HGE. HGE embeds temporal facts in a product space of Complex, Split-complex, and Dual subspaces.

2. It proposes two novel kinds of attention mechanisms - temporal-relational attention and temporal-geometric attention. These allow for representing relation changing frequencies and suitable geometries respectively. 

3. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HGE uniformly improves several state-of-the-art TKGE models. Subsequent ablation studies verify the general benefit of the attention-based product space models over the Complex space.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting HGE, which is an embedding approach that maps temporal facts into a product space of several heterogeneous geometric subspaces in order to capture diverse structural and logical temporal patterns. This is enabled by the two proposed attention mechanisms. Experiments show improvements over existing baseline TKGE methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Temporal knowledge graphs - Represent facts as quadruples (subject, predicate, object, time) that are valid over a certain time interval. Capture temporal information about facts.

- Link prediction - A common task for evaluating temporal knowledge graph embedding models, involves predicting missing entities or relations in incomplete temporal facts. 

- Temporal patterns - Logical patterns (e.g. symmetry, inverse relations) that hold over time in temporal knowledge graphs. Structural patterns (e.g. hierarchies, stars) are also considered.

- Complex space - A geometric space where embeddings can capture certain temporal patterns like symmetry based on circular rotations.

- Split-complex space - A geometric space suitable for modeling temporal hierarchies using hyperbolic rotations. 

- Dual space - A geometric space useful for capturing star patterns based on Galilean rotations.

- Product space - The paper embeds temporal facts in a product of the above heterogeneous geometric subspaces.

- Temporal attention - Proposed temporal-relational and temporal-geometric attention mechanisms integrate information from different subspaces and geometries based on the temporal dynamics and patterns associated with each relation.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a product space of heterogeneous geometric subspaces (complex, split-complex, dual) for embedding temporal knowledge graphs. What is the intuition behind choosing these specific geometries and what kinds of temporal patterns can each geometry capture effectively?

2. The temporal-relational attention mechanism in HGE models relations with varying frequencies of change. How exactly does this attention mechanism work? How are the static and dynamic relation embeddings derived and combined?

3. The paper claims that the temporal-geometric attention mechanism selects suitable geometries for a given relation based on the current relational and temporal information. What is the formulation of this attention mechanism? How does it operate on the scoring vectors from different subspaces?

4. Theoretical analysis is provided in the paper to show that HGE can model various temporal patterns like symmetry, inverse relations, evolving relations etc. Choose one temporal pattern and explain with an example how HGE is able to model that specific pattern.  

5. One claim in the paper is that HGE lifts limitations of prior complex space models that had to adhere to the geometric properties of a single space. Explain this claim and provide examples of what kind of temporal patterns were difficult to capture in prior complex space models.

6. Real and imaginary vector sharing is proposed between the different geometric subspaces. What is the intuition/experimental evidence presented for this design choice? What are its advantages?

7. How exactly does the scoring function in HGE work? Walk through the computations it performs starting from the entity, relation and time embeddings in each subspace. 

8. The ablation studies analyze the effects of different components of HGE like the attention mechanisms. What were some key observations from these studies? How do they provide insight into HGE's workings?

9. The case study in Figure 5 analyzes how the prediction works in different subspaces vs. in HGE for a particular query. Explain the thought process/intuition that leads to incorrect answers in the individual subspaces and how HGE is able to predict the right answer.

10. The paper compares performance vs. prior complex space models like TComplEx, TNTComplEx etc. What hypotheses do the results support regarding HGE's modeling capabilities? How does HGE achieve better performance despite using comparable model complexity?
