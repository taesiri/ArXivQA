# [HGE: Embedding Temporal Knowledge Graphs in a Product Space of   Heterogeneous Geometric Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13680)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) represent facts as quadruples (subject, predicate, object, time) that are valid over a time interval. 
- TKGs exhibit various temporal patterns such as symmetry, inverse, evolves, and temporary relations.
- Existing embedding methods use a single geometry like complex space to model TKGs which limits their ability to capture diverse temporal patterns.

Proposed Solution: 
- Propose a new embedding method called HGE that maps TKGs into a product space of heterogeneous geometric subspaces - complex, split-complex, and dual spaces.
- Each subspace geometry is suitable for modeling certain temporal patterns based on the unit circles induced by rotations.
- Introduce two novel attention mechanisms:
   - Temporal-relational attention to handle relations with varying rates of change  
   - Temporal-geometric attention to select suitable subspace geometries based on relational and temporal info.

Key Contributions:
- HGE embeds TKGs in a product space of multiple geometries to capture more diverse temporal patterns compared to using a single geometry.
- Theoretical analysis shows HGE can model symmetric, inverse, evolves and temporary temporal patterns.
- Temporal-relational and temporal-geometric attentions allow capturing static vs changing relations and best subspace geometry.
- Experiments on benchmark TKG datasets show HGE consistently improves state-of-the-art baselines.
- Ablation studies verify benefits of the heterogeneous geometry product space.

In summary, the key idea is to use a product space of multiple geometries along with temporal attentions to capture rich evolving temporal patterns in TKGs for better inference.
