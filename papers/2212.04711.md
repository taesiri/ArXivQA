# [ShadowDiffusion: When Degradation Prior Meets Diffusion Model for Shadow   Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04711)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we design an effective deep learning framework for shadow removal that incorporates both image degradation priors and powerful generative modeling capabilities? 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Modeling the shadow degradation process more accurately as a spatially-variant transformation dependent on a shadow mask will provide a better prior compared to existing methods. 

2) Integrating this degradation model into a diffusion framework can allow jointly restoring the shadow-free image and refining the shadow mask in an iterative manner.

3) The diffusion model's ability to capture image distributions combined with the physical degradation model will lead to higher quality shadow removal results.

4) Refining the shadow mask within the diffusion process itself will make the framework more robust to inaccurate initial mask inputs.

In summary, the central goal is to develop a novel deep learning approach for shadow removal that leverages both a physical degradation model as well as a generative diffusion model to capture image priors. The key hypothesis is that this combination will achieve significantly improved shadow removal performance compared to existing methods.
