# [Boosting Image Restoration via Priors from Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06793)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: Image restoration tasks like enhancement, deblurring, and denoising are important but challenging due to the ill-posed nature of these problems. While many effective networks have been proposed, further improving their performance is difficult as simply increasing model complexity often leads to overfitting. Leveraging external information as priors can help address the problem but estimating accurate priors is difficult. 

Proposed Solution: This paper proposes a novel approach to improve image restoration by leveraging features from pre-trained models as priors. The key ideas are:

1) Features from large pre-trained models like CLIP may contain useful restoration-related information from seeing varied degraded images during pre-training. 

2) A lightweight Pre-Train-Guided Refinement Module (PTG-RM) is proposed to refine the initial restoration results using these pre-trained features. This avoids directly aligning the different features spaces.

3) PTG-RM has two components:
   - PTG-SVE: Determines optimal short vs long range processing for each spatial location guided by the pre-trained features. This outperforms using a fixed fusion strategy.
   - PTG-CSA: Further refines the features using channel- and spatial-attention guided by the pre-trained features.
   
4) Experiments on various datasets and networks for tasks like low-light enhancement, deblurring, deraining etc. show consistent and often significant gains by plugging in PTG-RM, highlighting its generalization ability.


Main Contributions:

1) First work to leverage pre-trained models to improve image restoration performance.

2) Lightweight PTG-RM module to effectively adapt pre-trained features for refinement, using spatial-varying operations and attention.

3) Extensive validation over multiple tasks, datasets and networks demonstrating consistent gains, opening up possibilities for further leveraging pre-trained models.
