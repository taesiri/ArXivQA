# [Gotta Go Fast When Generating Data with Score-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14080v1)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we accelerate the process of generating high-quality and diverse images using score-based generative models?

In particular, the paper focuses on speeding up the sampling process when reversing the diffusion process in score-based generative models. Existing methods rely on the Euler-Maruyama solver which uses a fixed step size, making the sampling process quite slow. The paper proposes a more efficient SDE solver with adaptive step sizes tailored for score-based generative models.

The key hypothesis is that by carefully designing an SDE solver that takes into account the specific requirements of score-based generative modeling, it should be possible to significantly speed up sampling while maintaining or improving sample quality. The proposed solver aims to achieve this by using extrapolation for higher precision at minimal additional cost, minimizing the number of score function evaluations, using an adaptive error tolerance, and handling batches efficiently.

In summary, the central research question is how to accelerate sampling in score-based generative models, with the core hypothesis being that a customized SDE solver can achieve substantially faster sampling without sacrificing sample quality or diversity. The paper presents such a tailored SDE solver and empirically validates its capabilities.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my review, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new SDE solver tailored for score-based generative models that can generate high-quality samples 2-10 times faster than existing methods. Specifically:

- The paper proposes a novel SDE solver with adaptive step sizes that is designed specifically for score-based generative modeling. The solver takes a minimum of only 2 score function evaluations per step and uses extrapolation to achieve high precision. 

- The solver does not require any step size or schedule tuning unlike many existing methods. It can be applied to any diffusion process like variance exploding or variance preserving.

- Experiments show the proposed solver can generate samples of equal or better quality 2-10x faster compared to baselines like Euler-Maruyama and Langevin dynamics.

- For high-resolution image generation, the proposed method achieves significantly higher sample quality than other methods given a fixed compute budget.

- The solver addresses issues faced by off-the-shelf SDE solvers like divergence, slow generation, and poor sample quality. It is designed considering features specific to score-based models like high dimensionality, expensive score evaluations, and reduced precision needs.

In summary, the key contribution is a fast, high-quality, and tuning-free SDE solver tailored for score-based generative models that can accelerate the sample generation process substantially compared to existing approaches.
