# [A Question Answering Based Pipeline for Comprehensive Chinese EHR   Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11177)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Information extraction (IE) from electronic health records (EHRs) is valuable for healthcare research and applications. 
- Question answering (QA) models can extract more flexible information than conventional IE methods and are more accessible to clinicians, but progress is limited by lack of annotated QA data.

Proposed Solution:
- A pipeline to automatically generate QA training data from existing EHR annotations for basic IE tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction.  
- Templates are designed to convert annotations to QA format with questions and answers. Samples to judge answerability are also added.
- Preprocessing handles cases with discontinuous answers across sentences by splitting paragraphs and excluding irrelevant sentences. Post-processing merges extracted answer spans.  
- Transfer learning fine-tunes a QA model (Retro-Reader) on this auto-generated data.

Key Contributions:
- Novel pipeline to create QA training data from accessible EHR annotations, equipping QA models to assist in flexible EHR information extraction
- Techniques to handle discontinuous answers and judge answerability, achieving superior performance compared to traditional IE methods
- Demonstrated competency across diverse IE subtasks and impressive generalization ability in case studies and ablation studies
- Overall, the pipeline and QA model are suitable for practical EHR information extraction applications

In summary, the paper proposes an automated pipeline leveraging existing annotations to produce a performant QA model for flexible EHR information extraction, overcoming key challenges posed by the nature of EHR texts. The techniques and empirical analyses demonstrate the efficacy of this solution.
