# [One-for-All: Generalized LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07967)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question appears to be: How can we develop a flexible, scalable, and adaptable approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained vision models that works well across diverse downstream tasks and datasets?The key hypotheses seem to be:1) A generalized prompt module design per layer that allows concurrent tuning of weights, features, and input tokens will enhance the capability and flexibility of fine-tuning compared to only adapting weights (as in LoRA) or only adapting features (as in SSF). 2) A scalable, modular, layer-wise structure search can help identify the ideal adapter configuration for each layer, enabling more efficient adaptation compared to using the same adapter everywhere.3) Formulating fine-tuning as adaptation along additional dimensions on weights and activations will improve transfer learning, few-shot learning, and domain generalization abilities.4) Structural re-parameterization can eliminate the inference cost of additional fine-tuning parameters, making the approach practical for resource-limited applications.In summary, the central research question addresses how to develop a unified fine-tuning approach that is flexible, efficient, and effective across diverse tasks by concurrently tuning multiple dimensions and using an automated search procedure, while maintaining low computational overhead. The hypotheses focus on how a generalized prompt design, scalable layer search, adaptation along multiple dimensions, and structural re-parameterization can achieve these goals.
