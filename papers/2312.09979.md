# [LoRAMoE: Revolutionizing Mixture of Experts for Maintaining World   Knowledge in Language Model Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09979)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) with large amounts of data can improve performance on many downstream tasks. 
- However, increasing SFT data can disrupt the world knowledge previously acquired by the LLM during pre-training, referred to as "world knowledge forgetting".
- There is a tradeoff between improving capabilities on downstream tasks via SFT and retaining world knowledge in the LLM.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce LoRAMoE, a plugin version of Mixture of Experts (MoE), to address the world knowledge forgetting issue.
- LoRAMoE adds multiple parallel plugin networks ("experts") to each layer of the LLM. The experts are connected via a router. 
- The experts are separated into two groups with localized balancing constraints - one group handles aligning world knowledge with instructions, the other focuses on downstream tasks.
- Only the experts and routers are updated during training, while the LLM backbone remains fixed, preserving world knowledge.

Main Contributions:
- Identify world knowledge forgetting in LLMs when substantially increasing SFT data.
- Propose LoRAMoE to coordinate experts to retain world knowledge and improve downstream tasks simultaneously.
- Expert groups specialize via localized balancing constraints and router gating.
- Experiments show LoRAMoE maintains world knowledge with increasing SFT data while improving performance on other tasks.
- Visualizations confirm router focuses appropriate expert groups for world knowledge vs downstream tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes LoRAMoE, a Mixture of Experts based plugin architecture to alleviate world knowledge forgetting in large language models during supervised fine-tuning while enhancing performance on downstream tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors find that significantly increasing the amount of supervised fine-tuning data can severely impair the world knowledge inside large language models, due to the great modification of model parameters. This indicates a conflict between expanding instruction data and retaining world knowledge. 

2. The authors introduce a new trainable plugin for large language models called LoRAMoE, which has a similar architecture to Mixture of Experts. LoRAMoE can automatically route different data types to respective experts during training without modifying the original parameters of the language models. It employs localized balancing constraints during training to enhance expert specialization and internal balance. This allows partitioning experts into two groups - one to learn tasks and one to align world knowledge, thus reducing knowledge forgetting.

3. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAMoE through experiments. It can maintain stable knowledge in the model when expanding fine-tuning data, while performance on other downstream tasks is also improved considerably. The method is further evidenced through visualization of expert utilization during different tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the LoRAMoE method to address the conflict between expanding instruction data and retaining world knowledge in large language models during fine-tuning. LoRAMoE does this by routing data to separate expert groups and using localized balancing constraints.

The paper examines how substantially increasing supervised fine-tuning data for large language models can disrupt the world knowledge stored in them, causing "knowledge forgetting". It proposes a solution called LoRAMoE, which is a plugin version of Mixture of Experts using localized balancing constraints and Low-rank Adaptation to coordinate different expert groups - one for maintaining world knowledge and one for improving performance on downstream tasks. The effectiveness of LoRAMoE in avoiding knowledge forgetting and enhancing capabilities is demonstrated through experiments and visualization of expert utilization.
