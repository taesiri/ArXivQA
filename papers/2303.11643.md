## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to improve the sample efficiency and generalization of gradient-based meta-learning algorithms. 

The key hypothesis is that meta-learning algorithms can be improved by adding an additional outer loop that optimizes over a distribution of tasks, rather than just optimizing model parameters to perform well on a batch of tasks. The authors propose a new meta-learning algorithm called ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop) that adds this outer loop optimization over tasks. 

The key claims are:

- Adding an outer loop optimization over tasks improves generalization compared to just using gradient descent on model parameters. 

- The outer loop allows using very few gradient steps on each task (i.e. almost no inner loop), improving sample efficiency.

- ANIL achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot image classification benchmarks compared to prior meta-learning methods.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that adding an outer loop over tasks improves meta-learning performance, and ANIL is proposed to test this hypothesis, demonstrating improved generalization and sample efficiency over existing approaches on few-shot learning benchmarks.
