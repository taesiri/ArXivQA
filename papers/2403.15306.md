# [HortiBot: An Adaptive Multi-Arm System for Robotic Horticulture of Sweet   Peppers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15306)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Horticultural tasks like pruning, harvesting, etc. are labor intensive. Automating them is challenging due to semi-structured greenhouse environments, varying lighting conditions, irregular plant structures, dense foliage leading to occlusions, and the need to gently manipulate non-rigid plant organs. Prior works have limitations in reliably detecting fruits and peduncles, planning motions to avoid damage, and performing gentle yet firm manipulation.

Proposed Solution - HortiBot System:
The paper proposes HortiBot - a three-armed robotic system for horticulture tasks, especially selective harvesting. It has two 7-DoF arms for manipulation, equipped with force-torque sensors and pneumatic soft gripper (grasper) and a custom cutter. The third 6-DoF articulated arm carries a stereo camera (observer) for active perception. 

Key technical contributions are:
1) Workspace analysis and hardware design of a three-arm system meeting the requirements of harvesting task.
2) A perception pipeline detecting fruits, peduncles and stems in 3D, and building an online world model of plants by associating the detections. A novel cropped image based peduncle detection method is also introduced.
3) Dual-arm manipulation scheme using parameterized motions for long trajectories, and a custom online trajectory generator with 30Hz control for short motions needing frequent updates. Collision avoidance is incorporated. 
4) Adaptive manipulation behaviors for deciding grasp direction based on fruit and nearby stems, calculating cut pose using filtered peduncle point cloud, and monitoring force-torque measurements to regulate manipulation.
5) Experimental demonstration of complete harvesting cycle with 83.3% success rate and 27 secs per fruit, outperforming state-of-the-art selective harvesting robots.

In summary, the paper presents HortiBot, an integrated robotic system for horticulture tasks involving active perception and intelligent manipulation schemes. It demonstrates a complete pipeline from analysis, design, perception, planning to experiments for the task of selective harvesting.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

HortiBot is a three-armed robot system with active perception and dual-arm manipulation capabilities that achieves high success rates for automated selective harvesting of sweet peppers in lab experiments through the integration of fruit, peduncle, and stem detection, online trajectory generation, and force sensing.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1) The design and development of HortiBot, a three-armed robotic system for horticulture tasks such as selective harvesting. HortiBot consists of two 7-DOF manipulation arms equipped with force-torque sensors and grippers/tools, and a 6-DOF articulated "head" arm carrying stereo cameras for active perception.

2) A novel cropped image-based approach for detecting peduncles (fruit stalks) with higher accuracy compared to prior works. This is a key capability for reliable and gentle fruit detachment.

3) Online active perception methods using the articulated stereo cameras to dynamically update fruit and peduncle poses during manipulation to account for motion perturbations. This enables precise tracking and cutting. 

4) Dual-arm manipulation system using parameterized motions primitives for longer motions and a novel collision-aware online trajectory generator for shorter dynamic motions requiring frequent replanning. Compliant manipulation is achieved using force-torque feedback.

5) Integrating the hardware, perception, and manipulation components to create an autonomous selective harvesting system. Performance evaluation in lab experiments with real sweet pepper plants showed high success rates of 83% and cycle times around 27 seconds per fruit.

In summary, the main contribution is the design and demonstration of an integrated robotic system called HortiBot with capabilities for precise perception, planning and dual-arm manipulation that enables reliable autonomous harvesting of horticulture crops in semi-structured environments.
