# [AntGrip -- Boosting Parallel Plate Gripper Performance Inspired by the   Internal Hairs of Ant Mandibles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05364)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Two-fingered parallel plate grippers are commonly used in tight spaces for tasks like warehouse automation. However, their performance in grasping cylindrical objects is limited due to minimal contact area. Improving the grasping ability of such grippers could have a significant practical impact.  

- Ants use two-fingered mandibles very effectively for grasping a variety of objects. Examining ant grasping could provide insights to improve robot gripper performance.

Solution:
- The paper designs a two-fingered robot gripper called "AntGrip" inspired by the internal hairy structure of ant mandibles. 

- Interchangeable hairy and hairless soft gripping pads are 3D printed. The hair density and angle can be adjusted.

Method:
- A total of 2400 grasp experiments were conducted with 30 test objects comparing AntGrip in hairy and hairless conditions. Motion sequences were designed to test grasp success and robustness.

- Two metrics were used - grasp success rate and number of "quality grasps" judged by firmness during manipulation.

Results:  
- With hairs, grasp success rate improved by 29-38% and number of quality grasps more than doubled. Hairier pads increased improvement further.

- Hairs distributed grasp force over larger contact area, keeping objects stationary during manipulation.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates that adding simple hairs can significantly boost parallel plate gripper performance, especially for cylindrical objects.

- Provides new insight into the mechanical function of ant mandible hairs in grasp stability.

- The bio-inspired AntGrip design makes the gripper adaptable through adjustable hair patterns without added complexity.

In summary, the key novelty is using insights from ant mandible hairs to create adjustable hairy pads that substantially improve grasping ability and quality for a standard two-fingered gripper.
