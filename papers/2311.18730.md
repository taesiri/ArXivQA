# [Mavericks at ArAIEval Shared Task: Towards a Safer Digital Space --   Transformer Ensemble Models Tackling Deception and Persuasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18730)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors present their approach for the ArAiEval Shared Task 2023 on persuasion technique detection and disinformation detection. They utilize several transformer-based language models pretrained on Arabic text, including AraBERT, AraELECTRA, and MARBERT. These models are fine-tuned on the competition dataset consisting of multigenre text snippets and tweets labeled for the presence of persuasive content or disinformation. Ensemble techniques are used to combine multiple models, with hard voting ensembling yielding the best performance. For the persuasion detection task, an AraELECTRA model achieves the best individual performance with an F1 score of 0.750, while the ensemble achieves 0.742 F1 on the test set. For disinformation detection, an AraBERT model tailored for Twitter text performs best individually with 0.900 F1, and the ensemble achieves 0.901. In the post-evaluation phase, MARBERT emerges as the top performer when trained on additional tweet data, further boosting the ensemble performance. Key limitations are the computational expense of these models and potential biases in the pretraining data. Overall, the transformer ensemble approach effectively leverages Arabic language models for automated persuasion and disinformation detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents an ensemble approach using various transformer-based models for detecting persuasion techniques and disinformation in Arabic text.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on reviewing the paper, the main contribution appears to be:

The authors present their approaches for persuasion technique detection (Task 1-A) and disinformation detection (Task 2-A) in Arabic text. They experiment with several transformer-based language models that have been pre-trained on Arabic data, including AraBERT, AraELECTRA, and MARBERT. They fine-tune these models on the task datasets and use ensembling techniques to combine the models and improve performance. 

Their best performing system achieves a micro F1 score of 0.742 on the persuasion technique detection task and 0.901 on the disinformation detection task on the test sets. The authors conclude that pre-training the models on Twitter data and using ensemble techniques helps boost performance on these tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is using state-of-the-art Arabic language models, fine-tuning them on the task datasets, and combining them in ensembles to build high performing systems for detecting persuasion and disinformation in Arabic text.
