# [Fault Tolerant Neural Control Barrier Functions for Robotic Systems   under Sensor Faults and Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18677)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the problem of safety-critical control synthesis for robotic systems operating under sensor faults and attacks. Robotic systems are increasingly deployed in hazardous environments and need to satisfy safety constraints. Existing neural control barrier function (NCBF) based approaches can guarantee safety but are designed for benign environments without sensor failures or attacks. They fail to ensure safety when robots experience faulty sensor measurements or attacks manipulating sensor readings.

Proposed Solution:
The paper develops a new class of neural control barrier functions called fault tolerant neural control barrier functions (FT-NCBFs) to address this problem. The key ideas are:

1) Derive necessary and sufficient conditions for FT-NCBFs to guarantee safety of robots. 

2) Construct a loss function to learn valid FT-NCBFs that satisfy derived safety conditions. Minimizing this loss allows robots to be safe regardless of attacks.

3) Maintain multiple extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimators, each using a subset of sensors. Resolve conflicting estimates when sensor attacks occur.  

4) Formulate a quadratic program using learned FT-NCBFs to synthesize control inputs, proved to guarantee safety.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose the concept of FT-NCBFs for safe control under sensor attacks.

2) Provide safety guarantees for FT-NCBF based control - prove robot remains safe regardless of attack patterns.  

3) Develop data-driven method to learn FT-NCBFs by minimizing loss function encoding safety conditions.

4) Demonstrate effectiveness using obstacle avoidance and spacecraft rendezvous case studies. FT-NCBF approach maintains safety while baseline NCBF method fails.

In summary, the paper makes key contributions in ensuring robotic safety under faults and attacks. It develops FT-NCBFs along with data-driven synthesis and safety guarantees. Case studies validate the approach.
