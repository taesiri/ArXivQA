## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a new method for stabilizing the training of neural networks in tasks with feedback loops. What is the key idea behind this method and how does it help mitigate the issue of gradient variance amplification (GVA)? 

2. The paper evaluates the proposed method on continuous control tasks using MuJoCo environments. What were some of the key findings in these experiments? How robust and effective was the method in reducing reward oscillations across different model architectures and environments?

3. The paper suggests that standard regularization techniques do not help reduce GVA but variance reduction methods like large batch sizes, learning rate decay and iterate averaging do. Why do you think this is the case? What is it about variance reduction that makes it effective for stabilizing training with feedback loops?

4. Exponential moving average (EMA) of iterates is identified as a particularly effective stabilize7n[rlo 20[g]. What are some reasons this method works so well? How does it compare to other variance reduction techniques explored in the paper in terms of computational overhead and impact on training stability?

5. The paper explores the application of the proposed method to autoregressive language models as well. What modifications, if any, were required to apply iterative averaging in this setting? How did the results compare to those for continuous control tasks?

6. The paper presents some theoretical analysis using simple convex models to provide intuition about the causes of GVA. What are some of the key insights from this analysis? How well does convex theory explain the empirical findings?

7. One finding is that the optimal EMA parameters for mitigating GVA differ from those suggested by convex optimization theory. Why do you think this discrepancy exists? Does this point to some fundamentally non-convex phenomena underlying the effectiveness of EMA?

8. The paper focuses on the offline setting where the training data is fixed. How do you think the proposed techniques would fare in an online setting with distribution shift? Would the stabilizing benefits remain or could new issues arise?

9. What are some limitations of using iterative averaging as proposed in the paper? Are there any potential downsides or scenarios where it would not help improve stability?

10. The paper studies neural network training but the ideas seem more broadly applicable. What other areas, such as planning, control, recommendation systems etc. could benefit from using stabilization techniques to deal with feedback loops?
