# [Pseudorandom Error-Correcting Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09370)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Generating robust and undetectable watermarks for AI-generated content is an important challenge, especially for language models. Existing watermarking schemes face tradeoffs between quality, robustness, and efficiency. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new primitive called "pseudorandom codes" (PRCs) that have error correction capabilities like standard codes but are pseudorandom without a secret key. 

- PRCs can be used to construct undetectable and robust watermarks for language models. The idea is to replace some of the randomness used by the model with outputs from the PRC during text generation. This embedding process acts like a noisy channel, so PRC error correction allows recovering the watermark.

- The paper constructs PRCs based on LDPC codes under standard cryptographic assumptions about learning noisy parities (LPN problem). The PRCs can handle a constant fraction of substitution errors or deletions.

Main Contributions:

- Formal definition and constructions of pseudorandom codes, which simultaneously provide error correction and pseudorandomness properties.

- Undetectable watermarking scheme for language models that is the first to remain undetectable under a constant rate of random substitutions/deletions. Achieves the strongest quality guarantee possible.

- Constructs the first robust and secure steganography scheme that does not require sender/receiver to share state. Result relies on applying PRCs.

- Applications leverage PRC error correction to make the watermarks and steganography survivable under noise, delivering the first schemes in their settings with meaningful robustness guarantees.
