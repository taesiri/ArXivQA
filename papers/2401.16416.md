## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement: 
Dynamic 3D reconstruction of endoscopic scenes during minimally invasive surgery is critical for enhancing spatial understanding and navigation, but faces challenges due to limited field-of-view, occlusions, and non-rigid tissue deformations. While neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, they struggle with slow inference and rely on expensive stereo cameras or ground truth depth data, which are often infeasible. 

Proposed Solution:
The authors present Endo-4DGS, a real-time monocular endoscopic scene reconstruction technique using 4D Gaussian Splatting (GS) that requires no ground truth depth supervision. It extends 3D GS with a temporal dimension and lightweight MLP to model tissue dynamics. Monocular depth is estimated using Depth-Anything and acts as pseudo-supervision to guide the depth-based reconstruction.

Technical Contributions:
1) Adapts Gaussian splatting for endoscopic reconstruction using estimated monocular depth from Depth-Anything, avoiding the need for expensive stereo cameras or ground truth depth.

2) Introduces time as a 4th dimension to model tissue dynamics, deformations, and motions using a compact MLP within the 4D voxel grid.

3) Integrates depth ranking distillation loss for monocular depth estimation to act as pseudo-supervision, enhancing reconstruction. 

4) Demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy on two surgical datasets while operating in real-time (>100 FPS) using 4x less GPU memory than prior arts. Reveals high potential for advancing robot-assisted surgeries.

In summary, Endo-4DGS pushes dynamic monocular endoscopic reconstruction to real-time performance without reliance on ground truth depth or stereo cameras by innovatively combining 4D Gaussian splatting, Depth-Anything for monocular depth estimation, and depth ranking distillation loss. It sets the stage for improving surgical navigation and outcomes.
