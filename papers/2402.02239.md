# [Distributional Reduction: Unifying Dimensionality Reduction and   Clustering with Gromov-Wasserstein Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02239)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of unifying dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering into a single framework. Typically, these two tasks are performed sequentially, without ensuring alignment between the DR and clustering outputs. The authors propose looking at the problem through a distributional lens, where the goal is to find a reduced distribution in a lower-dimensional space that best preserves similarities from the input data distribution.

Proposed Solution: 
The authors formulate the problem as finding a reduced graph that minimizes the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) divergence from the input similarity graph. The reduced graph has $n$ nodes, representing prototypes/cluster centroids, connected through similarities encoded in $\simi(\mZ)$. The connections are aligned with the input graph similarities $\simiX(\mX)$ through an optimal transport coupling matrix $\mT$. Optimizing the prototypes' locations $\mZ$ and importance weights $\vh_Z$ allows jointly performing DR to represent the data in $\R^d$ and clustering to group input samples.  

Main Contributions:
- Show that many DR methods can be reinterpreted as GW projection problems, unifying DR and GW frameworks (Sec 3)
- Propose the novel distributional reduction (DistR) framework to jointly address DR and clustering via GW divergence minimization (Sec 4) 
- Establish connections between DistR and existing DR/clustering methods (KPCA, Spectral Clustering, etc)  (Sec 4.1)
- Design efficient algorithm leveraging semi-relaxed GW to solve the DistR problem (Sec 4.2)
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of DistR for simultaneous DR and clustering tasks on various real-world datasets (Sec 5)

In summary, the key innovation is a distributional view to unify DR and clustering based on GW divergence, enabling the joint optimization of embeddings and cluster assignments in a common OT-based framework. Comprehensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of the approach.
