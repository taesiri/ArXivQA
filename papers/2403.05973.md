# [Calibrating Large Language Models Using Their Generations Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05973)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in more applications, quantifying their confidence accurately becomes important to build trust and ensure safety. However, getting reliable confidence estimates from LLMs poses challenges - sequence likelihoods are often unavailable in black-box models, verbalized uncertainty responses can be inconsistent, and other methods require white-box access.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes APRICOT (Auxiliary PRedIction of COnfidence Targets), a method to train an auxiliary model to predict an LLM's confidence purely based on its input question and generated text output. It sets calibration targets by clustering question embeddings and using the accuracy on each cluster. The auxiliary model is then trained on question-answer pairs to predict these targets.

Key Advantages:
- Conceptually simple and easy to optimize
- Does not require internal access to target LLM
- Works for both white-box and black-box LLMs
- Enables applications like verbalizing uncertainty or adjusting answers 

Main Contributions:
- Proposes unsupervised way to obtain calibration targets from questions alone using clustering 
- Shows auxiliary model on input and output text can predict useful notion of confidence
- Analyzes which parts of LLM output are most useful for confidence prediction
- Evaluates method competitively on question answering, outperforming baselines in calibration error and incorrect answer detection

The method has limitations regarding clustering reliability and distributional shift. But overall, it provides an effective solution to predict confidence for black-box LLMs based on textual input-output only.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes APRICOT, a method to train an auxiliary model to predict the confidence of a target language model based only on its textual input and output, which is shown to be competitive in calibration error compared to other approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing APRICOT (Auxiliary Prediction of Confidence Targets), a method to train an auxiliary model to predict the confidence of a target large language model (LLM) based only on the LLM's textual input and output. The key ideas are:

1) Obtaining calibration targets for the auxiliary model by clustering sentence embeddings of the LLM's inputs and using the accuracy on each cluster as the target confidence score. This allows setting targets without access to the LLM's internals.

2) Showing that finetuning a smaller model like DeBERTa on just the LLM's input question and generated text output is sufficient to predict confidence scores that are well-calibrated and can reliably detect incorrect LLM answers.

3) Demonstrating that APRICOT performs competitively compared to other confidence quantification methods for LLMs in terms of calibration error and outperforms them in terms of the area under the ROC curve for identifying incorrect answers. The method works for both white-box and black-box LLM settings.

4) Exploring the utility of different parts of the LLM's output, finding that elements like chain-of-thought reasoning and verbalized uncertainty expressions can further improve the auxiliary model's effectiveness when available.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting a simple and effective method to quantify the confidence of black-box LLMs based solely on their textual input-output interface.

The paper proposes a method called APRICOT to quantify the confidence of large language models using auxiliary models. It aims to predict LLMs' confidence levels based only on their textual inputs and outputs, without needing access to the LLMs' internal states or likelihoods. Key goals are building trust in LLMs and pave the way for their benefits in applications. The method sets calibration targets by clustering sentence embeddings without metadata, and shows strong performance in terms of calibration and ability to detect incorrect answers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does APRICOT's clustering procedure for setting calibration targets compare to using metadata or question categories, if those were available? What are the trade-offs?

2. Could the clustering and target setting procedure be improved by using more advanced sentence embedding techniques like prompt-based methods? How might that impact the diversity and quality of clusters? 

3. The paper argues that chain-of-thought prompting could help expose signals useful for the auxiliary model. But could it also introduce spurious signals not reflective of the model's actual reasoning? How could this be tested?

4. What types of linguistic markers or other signals does the auxiliary model likely pick up on from the target LLM's output text? Could attention maps or other analysis provide insight here?

5. How suitable is the approach for other open-ended language generation tasks like summarization or translation? What challenges might arise in setting calibration targets and evaluating answer correctness?

6. Could the calibration targets be further improved by incorporating human judgments or other sources beyond just answer accuracy? What are some possibilities here?

7. How does the choice of auxiliary model impact results? Could more powerful models like GPT-3 further improve calibration and why? 

8. The paper argues verbalized uncertainty responses aren't very diverse. But could the auxiliary model help map these to more calibrated scores? Is this an avenue for improvement?

9. What other potential applications does a black-box confidence prediction model enable beyond those discussed in the paper?

10. How could the uncertainty of the auxiliary model itself be quantified? Could techniques like conformal prediction be used to produce confidence intervals?
