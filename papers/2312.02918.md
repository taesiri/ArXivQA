# [Multimodal Prompt Perceiver: Empower Adaptiveness, Generalizability and   Fidelity for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02918)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MPerceiver, a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that leverages the generative priors of Stable Diffusion for enhanced adaptiveness, generalizability, and fidelity in all-in-one image restoration. The key innovation is a dual-branch module comprising a cross-modal adapter that transforms image features into textual prompts, and an image restoration adapter that obtains multiscale visual prompts from the VAE embeddings. The prompts are dynamically integrated based on predicted degradations, enabling adaptation to diverse real-world degradations. Additionally, a plug-in detail refinement module is introduced to further improve restoration quality. Experiments across 16 image restoration tasks demonstrate MPerceiver's state-of-the-art performance in the all-in-one setting. It also shows excellent zero-shot and few-shot capabilities after multitask pretraining, underscoring its generalization ability. By effectively harnessing Stable Diffusion through multimodal prompt design, MPerceiver sets new state of the art for adaptiveness, robustness and fidelity in tackling intricate real-world image degradations within a unified model.
