# [Multimodal Prompt Perceiver: Empower Adaptiveness, Generalizability and   Fidelity for All-in-One Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02918)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes MPerceiver, a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that leverages the generative priors of Stable Diffusion for enhanced adaptiveness, generalizability, and fidelity in all-in-one image restoration. The key innovation is a dual-branch module comprising a cross-modal adapter that transforms image features into textual prompts, and an image restoration adapter that obtains multiscale visual prompts from the VAE embeddings. The prompts are dynamically integrated based on predicted degradations, enabling adaptation to diverse real-world degradations. Additionally, a plug-in detail refinement module is introduced to further improve restoration quality. Experiments across 16 image restoration tasks demonstrate MPerceiver's state-of-the-art performance in the all-in-one setting. It also shows excellent zero-shot and few-shot capabilities after multitask pretraining, underscoring its generalization ability. By effectively harnessing Stable Diffusion through multimodal prompt design, MPerceiver sets new state of the art for adaptiveness, robustness and fidelity in tackling intricate real-world image degradations within a unified model.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. It proposes a novel multimodal prompt learning approach to fully exploit the generative priors of Stable Diffusion for better adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity of all-in-one image restoration. 

2. It proposes a dual-branch module with a cross-modal adapter (CM-Adapter) and an image restoration adapter (IR-Adapter) to learn holistic and multiscale detail representations, respectively. The dynamic integration mechanism for textual and visual prompts enables adaptation to diverse, unknown degradations.

3. Extensive experiments on 16 image restoration tasks (all-in-one, zero-shot, few-shot) and 26 benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed MPerceiver in achieving high adaptiveness, robust generalizability, and superior fidelity when addressing diverse intricate degradations.

In summary, the main contribution is the novel multimodal prompt learning framework that enhances the adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity of all-in-one image restoration by exploiting the generative priors of Stable Diffusion. The dual-branch module and dynamic integration of multimodal prompts are key to enabling adaptation to unknown degradations.

- Adaptiveness - The ability of the method to adapt to diverse, unknown degradations, including complicated real-world cases with mixed degradations. 

- Generalizability - The capability to generalize to unseen degradation types in a zero-shot or few-shot manner without full retraining.

- Fidelity - The ability to reconstruct fine details and achieve high quality in the restored images.

- Multimodal prompt learning - The core technique in this paper of using both textual and visual prompts to provide holistic and detailed guidance to the Stable Diffusion model.

- Dual-branch module - The proposed architecture with cross-modal and image restoration adapters to handle the textual and visual prompts respectively. 

- Dynamic integration - Adaptively adjusting the textual and visual prompts based on predicted degradation types to enable handling of diverse degradations.

- Detail refinement module (DRM) - A plug-in module to refine details by fusing encoder and decoder features.

The key strengths claimed are the enhanced adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity compared to prior arts for all-in-one image restoration across a wide variety of degradation types and benchmarks.
