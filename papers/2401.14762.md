# [A Comparative Study of Compressive Sensing Algorithms for Hyperspectral   Imaging Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14762)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Hyperspectral imaging generates large amounts of data, posing challenges for processing, storage, and transmission. Compressive sensing (CS) techniques are used to compress hyperspectral data.
- This paper compares different CS reconstruction algorithms - convex (FISTA, ADMM) and greedy (gOMP, BIHT, CoSaMP) - for recovering compressed hyperspectral images.

Proposed Solution:
- Apply sparsifying transform to hyperspectral data to ensure sparsity. Then subsample 40% of the sparse data (2.5x compression). 
- Use convex and greedy CS algorithms to reconstruct original data from the compressed measurements.
- Compare algorithms on 3 datasets (Salinas, Jasper Ridge, China) in terms of recovery accuracy (PSNR) and performance (convergence, time).

Key Results:
- All algorithms successfully recover compressed data with PSNR >= 40dB.  
- Greedy gOMP and CoSaMP achieve highest accuracy. gOMP gives max PSNR 53-56dB across datasets; CoSaMP wider range 52-70dB.
- Greedy algorithms converge much faster than convex ones. gOMP converges for all pixels and is fastest.  
- Greedy algorithms have lower complexity O(M+N) than convex O(MÃ—N).
- gOMP overall best in accuracy and performance, but very sensitive to sparsity assumption.

Main Contributions:
- First comparison of FISTA, ADMM, gOMP, BIHT and CoSaMP algorithms on hyperspectral CS reconstruction
- Demonstrates gOMP has superior accuracy and performance, but relies heavily on correct sparsity level.
- Findings suggest further research to maximize gOMP accuracy while preserving performance.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.
