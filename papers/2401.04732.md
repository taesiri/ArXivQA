# [A case study of Generative AI in MSX Sales Copilot: Improving seller   productivity with a real-time question-answering system for content   recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of helping Microsoft sellers quickly find relevant sales and marketing content to share with customers during sales calls and meetings. Specifically, the authors aimed to build a real-time question-answering recommendation system for the Dynamics 365 CRM platform (MSX) to improve seller productivity.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a two-stage neural recommendation system to find relevant content from the Seismic repository given a seller's natural language query. The first stage uses a bi-encoder retriever to quickly find potentially relevant content based on metadata. The second stage re-ranks this content using a cross-encoder neural model to better match the query semantics. Prompt engineering is used to transform the metadata into natural language descriptions.

Key Technical Details:
- Prompt engineering to convert document metadata into natural language descriptions 
- Two-stage neural architecture
    - Bi-encoder retriever for fast initial retrieval
    - Cross-encoder neural re-ranker for better query-document semantic matching
- Leverages pre-trained language models like DistilBERT and MiniLM 
- Achieves sub-second latency for real-time recommendations
- Integrated as a skill into Dynamics 365 Sales Copilot 

Main Contributions:
- First neural recommendation system integrated into Dynamics 365 CRM
- Innovative prompt engineering approach to convert metadata into natural language
- Demonstrates a two-stage neural architecture for fast and accurate content recommendation
- Provides real-time recommendations to aid seller productivity, with positive initial user feedback
- Sets foundation for future improvements such as multi-modal features and opportunity-specific recommendations

In summary, the paper presents an innovative neural content recommendation system to aid sellers, with technical innovations in prompt engineering and a two-stage neural architecture. The system is deployed in Microsoft's Dynamics 365 platform to improve seller productivity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a real-time question-answering system integrated into the Microsoft Sales Experience platform to recommend relevant sales content to sellers by matching their queries against documents' metadata using prompt engineering and a two-stage semantic search architecture with bi-encoders and cross-encoders.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The development and deployment of a real-time question-answering system to recommend relevant sales content to sellers from a large repository, integrated as the first machine learning based skill into the production Microsoft Sales Experience (MSX) Copilot. 

Specifically, the paper presents:

- A prompt engineering method to transform document metadata into text descriptions that can be matched to natural language queries.

- A two-stage neural architecture using bi-encoders and cross-encoders with pre-trained language models to enable fast and accurate document retrieval and ranking.

- Techniques to optimize the latency and relevance of recommendations to meet real-time requirements.  

- An ablation study validating the utility of the two-stage architecture and numerical feature encoding.

- Deployment details and seller feedback confirming improved productivity from integrating this content recommendation system into the MSX Copilot interface.

In summary, the key innovation is developing a performant neural semantic search solution tailored for the sales domain and integrating it into a production business software environment.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a two-stage model architecture consisting of a bi-encoder retriever and a cross-encoder re-ranker. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this architecture compared to using just a single model?

2. The paper utilizes prompt engineering to transform the metadata of documents into natural language descriptions. How does this approach for representing documents compare to more traditional document embedding techniques? What are some limitations?

3. The mapping function g is used to categorize numerical features into buckets like "high", "medium", and "low". How sensitive are the results to the exact percentiles chosen for these buckets? Is there an optimal data-driven approach for setting these percentiles? 

4. The paper argues that incorporating numerical features into the prompts leads to improved relevance. But adding more features also increases latency. What would be a principled approach to determine the right tradeoff between number of features and latency?

5. The cross-encoder re-ranking stage operates on the top 100 candidate documents retrieved in the first stage. What is the impact of this cutoff value on relevance versus latency? How can the optimal cutoff be determined?

6. What kinds of context features related to the seller, customer, or sales opportunity could be incorporated to further improve personalization and relevance of the recommendations? How would they need to be represented?

7. The current evaluation methodology utilizes human annotation of relevance on a small set of queries. What are some limitations of this approach? How could more systematic offline and online evaluation be conducted? 

8. How well would the proposed model generalize to other document corpora beyond the Seismic repository? What kinds of challenges might arise and how could the model be adapted?

9. The model currently only utilizes metadata due to lack of access to document contents. How would performance change if actual text and images could be incorporated? What modeling extensions would be needed?

10. The paper mentions future plans to collect user feedback data. How specifically could this data be utilized to improve the model? What kinds of supervised learning techniques would be applicable?
