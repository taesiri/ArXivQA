# [Explainable Session-based Recommendation via Path Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Explainable Session-based Recommendation via Path Reasoning":

Problem:
- Existing session-based recommendation (SR) models focus on improving accuracy but lack explainability. 
- Traditional path reasoning methods prioritize knowledge graph exploration but ignore sequential patterns in session history.
- Current path reasoning methods are not suitable for generalization to SR scenarios because:
  - They only consider path reasoning in knowledge graphs, not impact of different session items.
  - Their reward functions don't cover skip behaviors of sequential patterns. 
  - They only select the last session item as reasoning starting point.

Proposed Solution:
- A generalized hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called PR4SR that provides explainability for SR models via path reasoning.
- Has a session-level agent that selects important session items as starting points for reasoning.
- Has a path-level agent that performs path reasoning in the knowledge graph.
- Uses a multi-target reward mechanism to adapt to skip behaviors of sequential patterns. 
- Introduces a path midpoint reward to enhance exploration efficiency.
- Incorporates image features into the knowledge graph to improve completeness and path diversity.

Main Contributions:
- First path reasoning approach using hierarchical RL to provide a generalized explainable framework for SR.
- First to combine skip behaviors of sequential patterns into reward mechanism design.
- New method of constructing product knowledge graphs with image features for higher connectivity and path diversity.
- Generalizes well to multiple SR models, improving both recommendation and explanation.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods on four datasets.
