# [Explainable Session-based Recommendation via Path Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00832)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Explainable Session-based Recommendation via Path Reasoning":

Problem:
- Existing session-based recommendation (SR) models focus on improving accuracy but lack explainability. 
- Traditional path reasoning methods prioritize knowledge graph exploration but ignore sequential patterns in session history.
- Current path reasoning methods are not suitable for generalization to SR scenarios because:
  - They only consider path reasoning in knowledge graphs, not impact of different session items.
  - Their reward functions don't cover skip behaviors of sequential patterns. 
  - They only select the last session item as reasoning starting point.

Proposed Solution:
- A generalized hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called PR4SR that provides explainability for SR models via path reasoning.
- Has a session-level agent that selects important session items as starting points for reasoning.
- Has a path-level agent that performs path reasoning in the knowledge graph.
- Uses a multi-target reward mechanism to adapt to skip behaviors of sequential patterns. 
- Introduces a path midpoint reward to enhance exploration efficiency.
- Incorporates image features into the knowledge graph to improve completeness and path diversity.

Main Contributions:
- First path reasoning approach using hierarchical RL to provide a generalized explainable framework for SR.
- First to combine skip behaviors of sequential patterns into reward mechanism design.
- New method of constructing product knowledge graphs with image features for higher connectivity and path diversity.
- Generalizes well to multiple SR models, improving both recommendation and explanation.
- Comprehensive experiments demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods on four datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework called PR4SR that provides explainable reasoning paths over knowledge graphs to improve the explainability and accuracy of existing session-based recommendation models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work lie in three aspects:

1. It proposes PR4SR, the first path reasoning approach that uses hierarchical reinforcement learning to provide a generalized and explainable framework for existing unexplainable session-based recommendation (SR) models. Specifically, a session-level agent selects important items from the session history as the starting point for path reasoning, and a path-level agent performs path reasoning to generate explainable paths.

2. It designs innovations in both the knowledge graph construction and the reinforcement learning framework to make PR4SR suitable for the SR scenario. This includes a multi-target reward to adapt to skip behaviors of sequential patterns, a path midpoint reward to improve reasoning efficiency, and incorporating image features into the knowledge graph to enhance its completeness. 

3. Extensive experiments show that PR4SR can improve the recommendation accuracy and explainability of various unexplainable SR models on four real-world datasets. It also outperforms the existing explainable SR framework REKS. Ablation studies and user studies further prove the rationality and effectiveness of different components of PR4SR.

In summary, the main highlight is proposing a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to provide explainability for unexplainable SR models, with tailored designs for the SR scenario. Both recommendation and explanation performance are enhanced by PR4SR.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this paper include:

- Session-based recommendation (SR) - The paper focuses on providing explainability for session-based recommendation models.

- Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) - The paper presents a hierarchical RL framework with a session-level agent and a path-level agent to enable path reasoning explanations for SR.

- Knowledge graphs - Knowledge graphs containing various entities and relations are used to provide reasoning paths to explain recommendations. The paper also discusses methods to construct enhanced product knowledge graphs.

- Explainability - A key focus of the paper is improving the explainability of SR models by enabling them to provide reasoning paths for their recommendations.

- Multi-target reward - A novel reward mechanism designed to accommodate sequential pattern skips in SR sequences.

So in summary, the key terms cover session-based recommendation, explainability, path reasoning, knowledge graphs, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and specialized reward design.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with a session-level agent and a path-level agent. Can you explain in more detail the motivation behind using this hierarchical structure compared to a single agent? What are the advantages?

2. The multi-target reward mechanism is designed to adapt to the skip behaviors of sequential patterns in session-based recommendation. Can you provide some examples of what these skip behaviors look like and how the multi-target reward accounts for them? 

3. The path midpoint reward is introduced to enhance exploration efficiency in the knowledge graph. Intuitively, why does considering the midpoint help improve exploration compared to only rewarding the endpoint?

4. Image features are incorporated into the knowledge graph construction to increase connectivity between entities. What specific image features are extracted and what image recognition API is used for this? 

5. The paper evaluates performance on both a recommendation task and an explanation task. Can you explain the metrics used for each task and why both tasks are important to evaluate for an explainable recommendation method?

6. What are the key differences between the knowledge graph construction used in this paper versus previous path reasoning approaches? What impact do these differences have on the performance?

7. The method is evaluated on multiple session-based recommendation baseline models. Why was it important to test across different types of models (RNN, attention-based, GNN-based)? What insights were gained?

8. Can you analyze the ablation study results and explain which components contribute most to the performance gains? Why are these components important?

9. How does the case study example demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method versus the existing explainable framework REKS? Can you walk through the example step-by-step?

10. The user study evaluates explanation quality from a human perspective. What were the key findings? Why is getting human judgment on explainability important in assessing these types of methods?
