# [Uncertainty Resolution in Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Misinformation poses threats like undermining public trust and distorting factual discourse. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can help mitigate misinformation but struggle with ambiguous statements lacking context.  

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a new method to resolve uncertainty in ambiguous statements by categorizing missing information and generating effective user queries to retrieve that information. 

- Develop a framework with 6 categories of missing information and manually classify all ambiguous statements in the LIAR-New dataset.

- Establish guidelines for when it's better to query the user versus conduct web retrieval. User queries are best for info like speaker, location, date, visual evidence.  

- Use a 2-LLM approach where LLM A asks a question to simulate the user, and LLM B provides an answer. LLM A then re-evaluates the statement's truthfulness. Questions are based on missing information categories.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive framework for classifying missing information into categories, with labels for the LIAR-New dataset to enable future research.

- Methodology and guidelines for determining when to query user versus web retrieval based on type of missing information. 

- Approach for generating user queries improves answerability by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 macro F1 compared to baselines.

- Establishes the effectiveness of resolving uncertainty by retrieving specific missing details from the user before re-evaluating statement veracity with GPT-4.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper introduces a framework for categorizing missing information in statements to help language models resolve uncertainty, and shows improved performance in misinformation detection when providing models with user feedback on missing details.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Developing a comprehensive framework for classifying missing information in the LIAR-New dataset into categories, and publishing category labels for the entire dataset to facilitate future research on content-specific misinformation mitigation tools.

2. Demonstrating a method centered on generating category-based user queries to retrieve specific missing details, which significantly improves GPT-4's performance in evaluating statement veracity and resolving uncertainty. This approach improves answerability of questions by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 macro F1 points compared to baselines.

3. Establishing guidelines for determining when it is appropriate to query users versus utilizing web retrieval based on the type of information initially provided. The paper shows GPT-4 can identify missing information types, decide if user querying is beneficial, and formulate suitable queries.

4. Providing a framework adaptable to other datasets with missing context to improve uncertainty resolution in misinformation detection systems.

The paper introduces a framework for categorizing types of missing information in ambiguous or context-deficient statements. It uses this categorization to generate targeted user queries to retrieve key details needed to evaluate veracity. Experiments demonstrate improved performance of the LLM GPT-4 on the LIAR-New dataset when provided with missing details from user queries, compared to baselines. Key contributions include the information category labels for LIAR-New, guidelines on when to query users, and an approach to formulate answerable questions that aid in resolving uncertainty.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a framework for categorizing missing information into 6 categories. What were the techniques used to identify these categories and how was the categorization process conducted? 

2. One of the key ideas is to query the user only when web retrieval is not feasible for resolving uncertainty. What guidelines did the authors establish regarding when to query the user versus using web retrieval? How were these guidelines developed?

3. The 2-LLM methodology uses one LLM to generate questions and another to provide answers simulating user knowledge. What were the exact prompting strategies used for each LLM? How were they designed to produce high quality and relevant questions and answers?  

4. The paper shows significant gains in performance from using category-based questions over generic questions. What examples demonstrate how category-based questions result in more concise and relevant information from the simulated user?

5. Question generation is evaluated based on answerability in addition to system performance gains. What methodology was used to assess answerability? What were the results comparing category-based and generic questions?

6. How exactly was the fill-in-the-blank baseline approach implemented? Why does providing speaker/location/date context not improve performance as much as category-based questions?

7. The guidelines for when to query the user are grounded in "practicality and necessity" - what does this mean? How do the guidelines determine when user knowledge is vital and unattainable elsewhere?

8. GPT-4 is used for category classification - what prompting strategy enables this capability? What were the results for classification accuracy overall and per category?

9. How are the human category labels for the LIAR-New dataset useful for future research directions in addition to enabling the methods in this paper?

10. The conclusion proposes integrating this approach with web retrieval - what methodology could optimize web queries by first determining if user querying is necessary? How can the system produce effective web searches?
