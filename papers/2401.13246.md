# [SEER: Facilitating Structured Reasoning and Explanation via   Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13246)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Structured explanations (e.g. entailment trees, reasoning graphs) enhance interpretability and trustworthiness of QA systems by explaining the reasoning process from question to answer. 
- However, generating these complex structured explanations poses significant challenges as it requires intricate structured reasoning across multiple steps with logical dependencies.
- Existing methods have limitations:
    - Supervised learning methods focus on isolated single-step reasoning, overlooking interdependencies. 
    - RL methods overlook structured relationships, impeding RL's potential.

Proposed Solution - SEER:
- A novel RL-based method to facilitate structured reasoning and explanation.
- Key ideas:
    - Structure-based return: Precisely captures hierarchical, branching structure in structured reasoning instead of just chained trajectory. Consistently handles equivalent reasoning trajectories.
    - Refined reward function: Distinguishes redundant vs erroneous steps. Redundant steps represent exploration rather than incorrect reasoning.
    - Policy: Generative model efficiently explores complex action space instead of enumerating all pairs of premises.

Main Contributions:
- First general framework for chained, tree and graph-based structured reasoning.
- Structure-based return significantly enhances RL for structured reasoning by handling intricate interdependencies.
- Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Outperforms RL methods by 4.4-6.9% on strict metrics.
- Demonstrates superior efficiency, outperforming a planning based method by nearly 8x in runtime.
- Exhibits outstanding cross-dataset generalization ability.

In summary, the paper introduces a new RL-based approach called SEER that achieves new state-of-the-art results for the challenging task of structured reasoning and explanation. The key innovation is the structure-based return.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes SEER, a novel reinforcement learning-based method that facilitates structured reasoning and explanation by precisely capturing the inherent tree/graph structure through a structure-based return and refining the reward function to guide policy updates.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes SEER, a novel RL-based method that facilitates structured reasoning and explanation. SEER is the first general framework that can enhance chained, tree-based, and graph-based structured reasoning.

2. It proposes the structure-based return to address the intricate interdependencies among different reasoning steps. The structure-based return effectively captures the hierarchical and branching structure inherent in structured reasoning.

3. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on structured reasoning datasets. It facilitates both the effectiveness and efficiency in structured reasoning and also exhibits outstanding cross-dataset generalization performance.

In summary, this paper makes important contributions in using reinforcement learning to enhance structured reasoning for explainable AI systems. The key innovation is the structure-based return which models the inherent tree/graph structure in logical reasoning and leads to performance improvements.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Structured reasoning - The paper focuses on facilitating structured reasoning, where the logical dependencies between reasoning steps follow an inherent tree or graph structure rather than a linear sequence.

- Reinforcement learning (RL) - The paper proposes using RL to enhance structured reasoning and explanation generation capabilities. Key RL concepts used include state, action space, policy, reward function, return, etc.

- Structure-based return - A key contribution of the paper is proposing this new return definition that precisely captures the hierarchical and branching structure in structured reasoning and handles equivalent reasoning trajectories. 

- Entailment trees and reasoning graphs - The paper experiments with generating these structured explanation formats that lay out the reasoning from facts to conclusions in a tree or graph structure.

- Cross-dataset generalization - The paper demonstrates strong performance in generalizing across datasets without additional fine-tuning.

- Policy modeling - The paper uses a generative model as the policy to effectively manage complex action spaces in structured reasoning.

So in summary, key terms cover structured reasoning, RL, tree/graph structures, cross-dataset generalization, and policy modeling. The core ideas relate to using RL, specifically the structure-based return, to facilitate complex multi-step structured reasoning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a structure-based return to capture the inherent tree/graph structure in structured reasoning. How does this precisely model the logical dependencies compared to chained returns? What are some examples that illustrate the benefits?

2. The policy employs a generative model rather than enumerating action pairs. What are the motivations and benefits of this approach? How does it aid structured reasoning and handle large action spaces? 

3. The paper refines the reward function to distinguish redundant and erroneous steps. What role do redundant steps play and why is appropriate penalization important? How were suitable values determined?

4. Ablation studies show that removing components like structure-based returns and RL degrade performance. Can you further analyze these drops and hypothesize why they are significant?  

5. The method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization ability. What intrinsic properties enable this? How do supervised methods fall short in this regard?

6. Error analysis highlights reasoning steps as the primary source of errors. What techniques could potentially improve premise selection and combination ordering?

7. For task 3's missing gold leaves error, how might the retrieval module be integrated into the RL framework to jointly optimize both components?

8. The paper focuses on enhancing structured reasoning. What modifications would be required to optimize for question answering if that was the end goal?

9. GPT-4 struggles with hallucinations despite reasoning capabilities. How can graph accuracy be improved while retaining answering accuracy? Any ideas to overcome this tradeoff?

10. The method runtime is much lower than planning-based approaches but higher than end-to-end. What are the time complexity bottlenecks and how can efficiency be further improved?
