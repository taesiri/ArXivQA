# [Do Machines and Humans Focus on Similar Code? Exploring Explainability   of Large Language Models in Code Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14182)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) focus on similar parts of code as human programmers when generating summaries of source code. Specifically, the authors measure where humans focus when summarizing code using eye-tracking metrics like fixation counts and duration. They then approximate where LLMs focus using SHAP, a perturbation-based method that treats models like black boxes. 

The authors compare human and LLM focus patterns across 6 LLMs - GPT3.5, GPT4, StarCoder, CodeLLama, NCS, and GPT3.5 fine-tuned with human demonstrations (GPT-few). They find no statistically significant evidence that LLM focus aligns with human focus. The correlation between human and LLM focus vectors is low, with significant correlation for at most 22% of methods. 

Additionally, the authors find no significant correlation between LLM-human focus alignment and the quality of LLM-generated summaries. This suggests factors other than focus patterns likely dictate summarization performance.

Overall, the lack of alignment between SHAP-based LLM focus and human focus patterns implies either:
1) SHAP may not effectively measure LLM focus for code summarization 
2) Humans and LLMs fundamentally differ in how they reason about and summarize code

The paper concludes that more research is needed to interpret LLMs for code summarization. Different methods may better capture LLM focus, or white-box approaches that access model internals could provide more insight. Understanding differences in human vs. LLM comprehension also warrants further study.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates the alignment between language models' focus on code, measured by SHAP, and human programmers' attention, measured by eye-tracking, during code summarization, and finds no statistically significant correlation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is investigating the alignment between language models' focus on code (measured by SHAP) and human programmers' focus (measured by eye-tracking) during code summarization tasks. Specifically, the paper examines whether there is a correlation between where language models focus in code (deemed important tokens by SHAP) and where human programmers visually attend, as well as whether an alignment in focus correlates with the quality of summaries generated by language models. The key findings are:

1) There is no statistically significant evidence suggesting alignment between SHAP-based model focus and human visual focus during code summarization.

2) The quality (accuracy, completeness, conciseness, readability) of summaries generated by language models does not correlate with whether the model's focus aligns with that of humans. 

In summary, the paper highlights an inability to align SHAP-based model focus measures with human attention, and calls for future work to investigate multiple open questions around developing explainable language models for code summarization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main keywords associated with it are:

- Neural Code Summarization
- Language Models
- Explainable AI
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Human Attention 
- Eye-Tracking

These keywords relate to the key aspects explored in the paper: using neural language models to summarize code, attempting to explain how these models work by comparing their focus/attention on code tokens to human attention measured via eye tracking, and analyzing the models' attention using the SHAP technique. The paper finds no significant correlation between human and model attention in this context. The keywords succinctly summarize the main topics and contributions of this research.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper uses SHAP to measure feature attribution in language models. What are some limitations of using SHAP for this purpose compared to other interpretability methods like attention weights or saliency maps? How could the authors further validate SHAP's efficacy?

2. The authors find no correlation between SHAP-based feature attribution and human visual focus. What are some potential reasons for this lack of alignment? Could it be an issue with how human focus was quantified or how SHAP was applied?

3. Only a small proportion of methods (at most 22%) show a statistically significant correlation between human and model foci. Why might alignment be inconsistent across methods? What characteristics of certain methods make alignment more likely?  

4. The authors use spearman's rho to quantify correlation between human and model foci. What are some limitations of using spearman's rho in this context? Would other correlation measures like Pearson better capture the relationships?

5. For methods showing significant correlation, the mean spearman's rho values are still quite low (-0.24 to 0.01). Why might the correlation be consistently low even when significant? Could the granularity of analysis impact results?

6. The authors analyze correlation between focus vectors aggregated across entire methods. How might results differ if attention is compared on a token-by-token or line-by-line basis? What challenges would this introduce?

7. GPT-few-shot uses additional human demonstrations, but does not improve alignment over regular GPT3.5. Why might few-shot learning fail to improve alignment in this case? What aspect of few-shot prompting might need refinement? 

8. The authors find no correlation between summary quality and human-model alignment. Given prior work showing benefits of human alignment, why might that not hold here? Could it depend on the task or models used?

9. Only 68 Java methods are analyzed in the study. Is this sample size sufficiently large to generalize results across different types of code? How could the sampling methodology impact findings?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on attention for summarization. Would findings potentially differ for other tasks like bug fixing or translation where attention alignment matters more? Why might attention alignment be less relevant to summarization?
