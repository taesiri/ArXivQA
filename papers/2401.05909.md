# [RoboCup 2023 Humanoid AdultSize Winner NimbRo: NimbRoNet3 Visual   Perception and Responsive Gait with Waveform In-walk Kicks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05909)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper presents the robot soccer system developed by Team NimbRo that won the RoboCup 2023 AdultSize Humanoid League. Their goal is to continuously improve their humanoid robots to get closer to beating the human FIFA world champions by 2050, as per the long-term vision of RoboCup.

Proposed Solutions and Contributions:

- Robot Platforms: They used their established NimbRo-OP2 and NimbRo-OP2X robots which are open-source 3D printed humanoid robots with 18 degrees of freedom.

- Visual Perception: They propose an improved perception model called NimbRoNet3 for detecting field objects, segmenting the field, and estimating opponent robot poses. It employs encoder-decoder architecture and is able to process images in real-time on the robot. 

- Walking and Kicking: They extend their existing CPG-based gait framework with fused angle feedback for footstep adjustment and a COM-ZMP controller for improved walking stability. They also develop a parametric kicking approach based on designed waveforms that enables stronger kicks.

- Soccer Behaviors: Their robots use finite state machines for high-level game behaviors and lower-level soccer skills based on the perceived game situation.

- Technical Challenges: They present approaches for push recovery, high kick over obstacle, and kicking a moving ball challenges. Their push recovery approach allows withstanding heavy pendulum pushes.  

- Competition Results: At RoboCup 2023, their robots dominated the soccer tournament without conceding a single goal over all games, winning the competition for the 5th consecutive year. They also won the Drop-In challenge.

In summary, the paper presents an improved humanoid robot soccer system with better perception, more robust walking and kicking, and flexible behaviors. These upgrades led their NimbRo team to deliver a dominant performance in the RoboCup 2023 AdultSize Humanoid soccer competition.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents upgrades to the NimbRo humanoid soccer robots' perception, walking stability, kicking, and push recovery leading to winning the RoboCup 2023 AdultSize soccer competition for the fifth consecutive year.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. An updated visual perception model called NimbRoNet3 that can estimate poses of opponent robots.

2. An extended fused angles feedback mechanism and additional COM-ZMP controller to improve walking stability.

3. A waveform-based formulation for parametric in-walk kicks that enables stronger kicks from longer distances. 

4. A new gait that helped win the Push Recovery technical challenge and outperform previous results.

In summary, the main contributions are updates and improvements to the visual perception, walking control, kicking, and push recovery abilities of the robots. These upgrades led to better overall performance and winning the RoboCup 2023 AdultSize soccer competition.
