# [Look, Listen and Recognise: Character-Aware Audio-Visual Subtitling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12039)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Look, Listen and Recognise: Character-Aware Audio-Visual Subtitling":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of automatically generating subtitles for videos that identify not just the spoken words but also the character speaking them. This is useful for improving accessibility of online videos as well as enabling large-scale datasets for training visual-language models. Current subtitles often lack speaker identity and other sound information needed for full accessibility. Prior works have limitations in requiring face detection/tracking or a lot of metadata.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an audio-visual method to generate character-aware subtitles from video and minimal metadata. The key ideas are:

1) Build a database of high-precision "speech exemplars" for each character using audio-visual cues to filter clips to those with one visible speaker.

2) Compare voice embeddings of all speech segments to exemplar embeddings to classify speaker identity.

Main Contributions:

1) Proposes the new task of character-aware audio-visual subtitling to generate subtitles with speaker identity.

2) Develops a fully automatic pipeline to generate character-aware subtitles without needing face detection/tracking.

3) Curates and manually refines an evaluation dataset with character-level subtitles for multiple sitcoms.

4) Evaluates the proposed method on this dataset, reporting performance on speaker diarisation and character recognition.

The method does not handle overlapping speech or non-speech sounds for full accessibility. But it demonstrates a promising approach to automatically generating richer subtitles from video, needing only cast metadata. The curated evaluation benchmark fills an important gap to measure progress in this direction.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an audio-visual method for automatic character-aware subtitle generation that generates a full transcript of the dialogue with precise speech timestamps and speaker identities, using audio-visual cues to select high-precision audio exemplars for each character to then classify all speech segments by speaker.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is:

The authors propose a new task of character-aware audio-visual subtitling, which aims to generate the "what" (spoken words), "when" (timing information), and "by whom" (speaker identity) for subtitles from videos, using minimal metadata. 

Specifically, the main contributions are:

(i) Proposing the new task of character-aware audio-visual subtitling.

(ii) Developing an automatic pipeline for this task that does not require face detection or tracking.

(iii) Curating an evaluation dataset with character-level subtitles for three sitcom series: Frasier, Scrubs and Seinfeld. 

(iv) Evaluating the proposed method on this dataset and analyzing its performance at different stages, including detailed analysis of the audio exemplar building stage and the character assignment stage.

In summary, the key novelty is in defining and tackling the new problem of character-aware subtitling using audio-visual analysis, without reliance on face recognition.

The paper proposes a new task of "character-aware audio-visual subtitling" which aims to generate subtitles that cover what is said, when it is said, and by whom - including speaker identification. The key idea is to use audio-visual cues to build a database of high-precision speech exemplars for each character, and then use these to classify all speech segments by speaker identity, without needing face detection or tracking. The envisioned application is improving accessibility of videos through automatic subtitle generation. So the core focus is on audio-visual speaker diarisation and identification, as well as speech recognition, to enable character-aware subtitling.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions building a database of "audio exemplars" for each character. Can you explain in more detail how these audio exemplars are selected in Stage 1 and what criteria is used to filter them?

2. In Stage 2, speech segments are assigned to characters by comparing voice embeddings. Can you elaborate on the distance metric used for this comparison and how the threshold for assigning "unknown" is determined? 

3. The paper evaluates performance based on diarization error rate, accuracy, precision, and recall. Can you explain what each of these metrics captures and why they are all reported? Which seems most crucial for this task?

4. One limitation mentioned is that the method does not deal well with overlapping speech. What approaches could be explored to handle this type of speech in the subtitles generated?  

5. The qualitative example shows the subtitles and timings produced by the method. In what ways could this output be improved or formatted differently for real applications?

6. The paper relies on metadata about character names and sample images. How difficult do you think it would be to obtain this automatically instead? What sources could provide that information?

7. The results show better performance on Fraiser compared to Scrubs. What are some possible reasons for the difference in results between shows?

8. The paper does not require face detection or tracking. Do you think incorporating faces would help the performance, especially for less common characters? Why or why not?

9. The exemplars are built using multiple episodes then applied on a test set. How do you think the performance would change if exemplars and test data came from the same episodes?

10. The goal is generating subtitles usable by streaming platforms. What other inference speed or platform constraints need to be considered to make this method practical at scale?
