# [Under-Display Camera Image Restoration with Scattering Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04163)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we develop an effective image restoration method to address the problem of image degradation caused by the scattering effect in under-display camera (UDC) imaging systems?The key points are:- Existing UDC image restoration methods have largely neglected the treatment of the scattering effect caused by the display layer in UDC systems. This scattering effect results in image degradation like contrast distortion and haziness. - The authors propose to explicitly model the UDC scattering effect using a physics-based approach that decomposes the received camera irradiance into transmitted and scattered components. - Using this scattering model, they enhance the image formation pipeline to generate more realistic synthetic UDC images for training.- They design a dual-branch neural network with a scattering branch to estimate parameters of the scattering effect, and an image branch to restore the clean image. The branches are coupled through a feature fusion block.- Experiments on synthetic and real-world UDC images demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods in removing scattering-induced degradation and restoring image details.In summary, the central hypothesis is that by explicitly modeling and estimating the parameters of the UDC scattering effect, they can design an effective image restoration network to address this major degradation cause in UDC imaging. The results validate the effectiveness of their approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a new approach for restoring images captured by under-display cameras (UDCs). The key contributions are:- It proposes a physical model to characterize the scattering effect caused by the display in UDC imaging. This scattering effect results in degradation like haze and contrast distortion in UDC images. - Based on the proposed UDC scattering model, it enhances the image formation pipeline to synthesize more realistic UDC images with ground truth for training.- It designs a two-branch deep network for UDC image restoration. One branch estimates parameters of the scattering effect, while the other branch restores the clear image guided by the first branch. - It develops several network components tailored for UDC image restoration, including Transposed Self-Attention Blocks, Gated Channel Attention Blocks, and Feature Fusion Blocks.- Experiments on both synthetic and real-world UDC images demonstrate superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. The restored images have significantly improved visual quality.In summary, the key novelty is explicitly modeling and addressing the scattering effect in UDC imaging and restoration, through both physical modeling and network design. This leads to performance improvements compared to prior arts.
