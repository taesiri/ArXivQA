# [IndicVoices: Towards building an Inclusive Multilingual Speech Dataset   for Indian Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01926)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of sufficient, diverse, and high-quality speech data for Indian languages to build accurate speech systems. Prior efforts have limitations in terms of languages covered, domains, speech types (read/extempore/conversational), speaker diversity, etc.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces IndicVoices, a comprehensive multilingual speech dataset for 22 Indian languages, adhering to an inclusive diversity wishlist.

- It contains 7348 hours of read (9%), extempore (74%) and conversational (17%) speech from 16237 speakers covering 145 districts. 1639 hours are already transcribed.

- The data collection process follows a clear framework to ensure diversity:
   - Questions, prompts and roleplays covering 21 domains and 28 topics to elicit meaningful responses
   - Countrywide network of partners to source diverse participants
   - Quotas for gender, age, background, location diversity
   - Standardized collection procedure and platforms
   - In-house quality control and transcription teams and elaborate guidelines

Main Contributions:

- Open-sourced a unique blueprint for diverse multilingual data collection, including questions, prompts, scenarios, platforms, guidelines etc. which can be replicated for other languages

- Released IndicVoices dataset with 7348 hours of read, extempore and conversational speech in 22 languages from a diverse pool of speakers

- Built IndicASR, the first ASR model supporting all 22 constitutional languages of India, outperforming prior models

- The data can enable advances in various speech tasks beyond ASR such as speaker verification, intent detection etc. for Indian languages

In summary, the paper makes significant contributions through the release of diverse Indian language speech data, tools and benchmarks that can catalyze speech research for low resource languages.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents IndicVoices, a comprehensive multilingual speech dataset for 22 Indian languages containing over 7000 hours of read, extempore, and conversational speech from 16000 speakers across 145 districts, with the goal of advancing speech technology for low resource languages.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation and release of IndicVoices, a large-scale multilingual speech dataset for 22 Indian languages. Specifically:

1) The paper introduces IndicVoices, a dataset containing 7348 hours of read, extempore, and conversational speech data covering 22 Indian languages. 1639 hours have already been transcribed. 

2) The paper shares an "open-source blueprint" for large-scale speech data collection, including protocols, tools, engaging prompts/scenarios, quality control mechanisms, transcription guidelines, etc.

3) The paper describes the process and challenges faced in capturing India's linguistic, cultural and demographic diversity during data collection across urban and rural regions.

4) The paper introduces IndicASR, the first ASR model trained on IndicVoices that supports all 22 Indian languages listed in the constitution. It outperforms existing models.

5) The paper makes all data, tools, models, and other materials publicly available to promote speech research for Indian languages.

In summary, the key contribution is the creation and release of the IndicVoices dataset to advance speech technology for low resource Indian languages, along with all supporting materials to enable further data collection.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- IndicVoices - The name of the multilingual speech dataset created through this work. It contains audio in 22 Indian languages.

- Multilingual speech recognition - A key focus of the paper is building automatic speech recognition systems that support multiple Indian languages.

- Low resource languages - The languages covered in IndicVoices dataset are considered low resource since most existing datasets and models focus primarily on English.

- Transcription - A major component of the work involved transcribing the collected audio data. The paper discusses transcription guidelines, workflow etc. in detail. 

- Inclusive - A core goal is to make the dataset demographically, geographically and culturally inclusive and representative of diversity in India.

- Diversity - Capturing diversity across languages, accents, topics, speaker demographics is a key theme.

- Data collection - The paper documents the end-to-end process and challenges involved in large scale speech data collection across India.

Some other notable terms include language families, districts, consent, prompts, scenarios, quality control, noise tags, errors, level 1 and level 2 transcription etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the IndicVoices paper:

1. The paper mentions creating a "wishlist" to guide data collection and ensure diversity. What were some of the key elements in this wishlist and how did they help shape the overall dataset? 

2. The pre-collection data preparation involved creating questions, prompts, sentences etc. to elicit meaningful responses from participants. What was the process followed to create these materials and what role did linguistic experts play?

3. The paper emphasizes the importance of field coordinators in facilitating smooth data collection. What specific training was provided to these coordinators and how did that help in participant onboarding and guidance?

4. The paper mentions using the Karya platform for distributed data collection. What customizations were done to this platform and what specific advantages did it provide over other options? 

5. A two-level transcription strategy was adopted to balance verbatim representation and standard spellings. Can you explain the difference between these two levels and the rationale behind having two levels of transcription?

6. What were some of the key challenges faced in the transcription process and how were the guidelines iteratively refined to address them? 

7. The paper highlights the importance of Quality Control using an in-house team. What were the different aspects that this QC team verified and what measures were taken to ensure data integrity?

8. Train-test splits were created using a sampling based method to balance demographic distribution. Can you explain this process in more detail? What metrics were used to evaluate the splits?

9. The paper focuses mainly on ASR but mentions several other use cases for the dataset. Can you enumerate at least 5 other tasks that could benefit from such a diverse multilingual speech corpus?

10. From a project management perspective, what were some of the key learnings in executing a data collection endeavor at this unprecedented scale and complexity across India? What innovations on the process side made this feasible?
