# ChatSpot: Bootstrapping Multimodal LLMs via Precise Referring   Instruction Tuning

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central hypothesis seems to be that incorporating precise referring instructions (such as points, boxes, etc.) into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) will allow for more flexible and finer-grained human-AI interaction compared to using language instructions alone. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that:- By using precise referring instructions like mouse clicks or bounding boxes to refer to regions of interest, MLLMs can focus on specific areas of an image to enable more detailed and nuanced interactions.- Providing spatial information through precise referring prompts will enhance an MLLM's ability to comprehend spatial relationships and perform spatial reasoning on regions of interest.- Allowing diverse referring instruction forms beyond just language, such as points, boxes, and polygons, will result in a more natural and seamless interactive experience between user and MLLM.- Training the MLLM on a large-scale multi-grained dataset of referring instructions will equip it with strong abilities for spatial perception, fine-grained analysis, and reasoning on selected regions.To summarize, the central hypothesis is that augmenting MLLMs with precise referring instructions will significantly improve the flexibility, accuracy and efficiency of human-AI interaction and spatial understanding compared to language instructions alone. The authors design and evaluate the ChatSpot model to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing "precise referring instructions" that utilize diverse reference representations like points and boxes to refer to specific regions of interest. This enables finer-grained human-AI interaction by allowing the model to focus on particular areas. 2. Developing ChatSpot, an end-to-end multimodal large language model that supports various forms of interaction including mouse clicks, drag-and-drop, and drawing boxes. This provides more flexible and seamless interaction.3. Constructing a large-scale multi-grained vision-language instruction following dataset (MGVLID) with around 1.2M images and 3M query-answer pairs. This supports training models like ChatSpot.4. Designing a series of evaluation tasks and metrics to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, especially for region recognition and interaction abilities. Experiments showcase ChatSpot's promising performance.In summary, the main contribution appears to be proposing precise referring instructions and the ChatSpot model to enable finer-grained human-AI interaction via diverse input modalities like clicks and boxes. The model is trained on a large-scale multi-grained dataset and evaluated on specialized tasks.
