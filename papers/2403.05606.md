# [A Concept-based Interpretable Model for the Diagnosis of Choroid   Neoplasias using Multimodal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05606)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diagnosing rare diseases like uveal melanoma is challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and the need for interpretable models that specialists can validate. 
- Existing vision-language models fail for rare diseases and lack interpretability.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors build the first large multi-modal dataset of 750 patients with uveal melanoma and related eye diseases, spanning fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography and ultrasound images.

- They propose the Multimodal Medical Concept Bottleneck Model (MMCBM), an interpretable model that incorporates clinical knowledge by aligning image features to semantic concepts validated by domain experts. 

- MMCBM achieves high accuracy rivaling black-box models, while also providing human-readable explanations to increase trust and enable specialist verification.

Key Contributions:
- Creation of the currently largest multi-modal clinical dataset for choroidal tumors with 750 patients.

- Introduction of the MMCBM framework that integrates clinical knowledge into machine learning models to produce interpretable predictions.

- Demonstration that MMCBM matches state-of-the-art accuracy (F1 score of 0.91) while boosting the diagnostic performance of junior doctors by 42% when used alongside model concepts.

- Analysis showing the feasibility of leveraging large language models to extract medically relevant concepts from reports and validate them via specialist feedback.

In summary, this work makes progress towards interpretable AI for the diagnosis of rare diseases by aligning model representations with human-comprehensible clinical concepts through a collaborative process with domain experts. The presented dataset and MMCBM framework pave the way for further clinical validation and real-world deployment.
