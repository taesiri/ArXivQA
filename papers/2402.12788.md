# [RhythmFormer: Extracting rPPG Signals Based on Hierarchical Temporal   Periodic Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12788)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to extract blood volume pulse (BVP) signals for measuring vital signs like heart rate from facial videos in a non-contact way. However, rPPG signals are very weak and susceptible to noise, posing challenges for accurate measurement.  
- Existing methods using CNNs or Transformers have not conclusively shown superior performance over traditional signal processing techniques. This may be due to coarse feature extraction being susceptible to noise, or Transformers struggling to focus on subtle rPPG signal changes over more prominent facial features.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes RhythmFormer, a transformer-based method that explicitly leverages the periodic nature of rPPG signals to design a periodic sparse attention mechanism for hierarchical multi-scale feature learning.

- A Fusion Stem is used to integrate frame difference information to guide representations to focus on rPPG signals. 

- The core Hierarchical Temporal Periodic Transformer module computes periodic sparse attention to gather skin regions with similar phases over multiple temporal scales, allowing finer-grained rPPG feature extraction.

- A HR hybrid loss combining time-domain, frequency-domain and HR distribution distance losses is used to mitigate gaps between BVP loss and HR metrics.

Main Contributions:
- Novel periodic sparse attention mechanism to leverage rPPG signal periodicity for finer-grained feature learning across temporal scales.

- Fusion Stem module to enhance rPPG representations and guide transformer attention, improving performance when integrated into other methods.

- State-of-the-art results on multiple datasets with fewer parameters and computations, showcasing robustness.

- The code and models are publicly released to serve as a strong baseline for supervised rPPG estimation.

In summary, the key innovation is in designing components tailored for rPPG properties to achieve robust and accurate measurement where previous approaches have struggled. The periodic sparse attention and fusion stem in particular are simple yet effective ideas.
