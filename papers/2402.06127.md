## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Traditional traffic simulators rely on rule-based models to govern driving behaviors, but these oversimplify behaviors and result in unrealistic simulations. 
- Some simulators allow integrating ML models via APIs to provide more realistic behaviors, but this approach faces challenges in scalability and efficiency as vehicle numbers increase due to expensive simulator-model communications.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose CityFlowER, an advancement to the CityFlow simulator, which efficiently enables realistic city-scale traffic simulation. 
- CityFlowER innovatively pre-embeds ML models within the C++ simulator codebase to eliminate the need for external API calls. This allows blending rule-based and learned models to govern individual vehicle behaviors.

Key Contributions:
- Proposes a simulator-level behavior model pre-embedding mechanism for efficient and flexible simulation.
- Implements this in CityFlowER by directly compiling ML models into the simulator using C++ LibTorch.
- Shows CityFlowER can accurately recover behaviors from CityFlow and SUMO.
- Demonstrates efficiency on par with baseline simulators and significantly faster than API-based simulation.
- Enables flexible specification of diverse driving models for individual vehicles.
- Overall, advances state-of-the-art in microscopic traffic simulation through an efficient and extensible architecture for integrating realistic learned driving models.

In summary, this paper makes traffic simulation significantly more realistic by pre-embedding machine learning models directly into the simulator source code to govern driving behaviors, while retaining computational efficiency, flexibility, and scalability. This helps enable more reliable analyses and planning for transportation systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper introduces CityFlowER, an advancement to the CityFlow traffic simulator, which efficiently embeds machine learning models within the simulator to enable realistic and flexible driving behaviors while maintaining high computational performance for large-scale simulations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing and implementing a new traffic simulator called CityFlowER that embeds machine learning models directly into the simulator code to control driving behaviors. This allows for more realistic driving behaviors compared to purely rule-based models, while maintaining high efficiency by avoiding costly external API calls between the simulator and ML models.

Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Proposing a novel behavior model pre-embedding mechanism that loads ML models directly into the simulator C++ code and uses them to determine driving actions. This avoids API communication overhead.

2) Implementing this approach in an enhanced version of the CityFlow simulator called CityFlowER, showing feasibility and efficiency compared to API-based simulations.

3) Demonstrating the ability to recover behaviors from both CityFlow and SUMO simulators through learned models.

4) Showing the flexibility to specify different behavior models for individual vehicles to enable diverse and realistic driving behaviors.

In summary, the main contribution is the design and implementation of an efficient and flexible traffic simulation framework CityFlowER that embeds ML models to enhance realism.
