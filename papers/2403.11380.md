# [Boosting Order-Preserving and Transferability for Neural Architecture   Search: a Joint Architecture Refined Search and Fine-tuning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11380)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Current neural architecture search (NAS) methods that use a supernet to estimate performance face a dilemma between global and local order-preserving ability. 
- Global order-preserving ability refers to distinguishing good vs poor architectures across the whole search space.  
- Local order-preserving ability refers to precisely ranking top-performing architectures.
- Improving one aspect often compromises the other. Additionally, transferring supernets to new tasks remains challenging.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a Supernet Shifting technique during the evolutionary search that accumulates training loss and fine-tunes the supernet whenever an architecture is sampled.  
- This shifts the supernet to focus on top-ranked architectures from the evolutionary search, enhancing local order-preserving ability.
- Retains global order-preserving ability by initially training the supernet with uniform sampling.
- For transferring, freeze encoder weights and fine-tune decoder + prediction layers of the supernet on the new task.

Main Contributions:
- Analyze tradeoff between global vs local order-preserving NAS abilities.
- Propose Supernet Shifting to boost both, with little added compute cost.
- Show shifted supernet outperforms baselines on ImageNet, is transferable to new datasets with no drop in accuracy while cutting search costs by 10x.
- First demonstration of transferring full pre-trained supernet weights to new task by fine-tuning during search.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective yet low-cost way to improve order-preserving abilities for weight-sharing NAS methods, while also enabling flexibility for transferring supernets to new datasets/tasks. Key innovation is accumulating loss to shift supernet attention during evolutionary search.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a supernet shifting method during neural architecture search which improves both order-preserving ability and transferability by gradually focusing the supernet on superior architectures during the search process and enabling flexible transfer to new tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides a comprehensive analysis of global and local order-preserving abilities for neural architecture search (NAS) methods that use proxies/supernet to estimate performance. 

2) It proposes a novel supernet shifting method during evolutionary search to improve both global and local order-preserving abilities. Specifically, the supernet is adaptively focused on superior architectures by accumulating their training loss while searching, achieving better ranking consistency.

3) It shows that the proposed method allows flexible transfer of the supernet to new tasks/datasets by fine-tuning only the classifier layer during search. This significantly reduces NAS cost and hardware restrictions.

4) Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving search quality, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet while reducing FLOPs. The transferred supernet also finds competitive architectures on new datasets with 10x speedup.

In summary, the key contribution is a stable and flexible NAS strategy to boost order-preserving abilities and enable supernet transferability via joint architecture search and adaptive supernet fine-tuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
- Supernet
- Order-preserving ability (global and local)
- Transferability
- Supernet shifting 
- Evolutionary algorithm
- Pareto optimal architectures
- Pre-trained models
- Fine-tuning

The paper proposes a method called "supernet shifting" to improve both the global and local order-preserving abilities of NAS methods that use a supernet to estimate architecture performance. This allows searching algorithms like evolutionary algorithms to find better architectures. The paper also shows that the proposed method enables transferring a pre-trained supernet to new tasks/datasets, avoiding costly retraining. Concepts like Pareto optimality, fine-tuning, and evolutionary algorithms are also relevant as they are used in the proposed approach.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) How does the concept of global and local order-preserving ability provide new insights into analyzing NAS methods? What are the limitations of only focusing on one or the other?

2) The paper argues that current NAS methods face a dilemma in ensuring both global and local order-preserving abilities. Explain this dilemma in more detail and why it is difficult to achieve both.  

3) Explain the concept of Supernet Shifting and how it helps improve both global and local order-preserving abilities. What is the theoretical basis behind using evolutionary search to guide the shifting process?

4) How does Supernet Shifting introduce less bias compared to methods that use an architecture parameter like DARTS? What are the tradeoffs?

5) Discuss the differences between modifying the sampling strategy during supernet training vs. during evolutionary search. What are the advantages of making changes during the search phase?

6) Explain in detail the process of transferring a supernet to a new dataset using the proposed approach. What modifications need to be made? Why is this more flexible than training a new supernet?

7) What datasets were used to evaluate order-preserving abilities and final architecture performance? Why were different datasets needed for different experiments? What are their limitations?  

8) How was Kendall's tau coefficient used to evaluate local order-preserving ability? What are other metrics that could be used instead and what are their pros and cons?

9) In the discussion about fairness, the paper argues evolutionary search provides a "statistically correct" sampling strategy. Elaborate on what this means and potential issues with using evolutionary search.

10) The method relies on accumulating loss during evolutionary search to guide Supernet Shifting. Discuss any potential drawbacks of using loss instead of directly using validation accuracy. Could other metrics guide the shifting process better?
