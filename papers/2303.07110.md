# [Upcycling Models under Domain and Category Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07110)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is: How can we adapt deep neural network models to new target domains and tasks using only a pre-trained source model, without requiring the original source training data, and without knowing the category shift a priori?In particular, the key goals are:- To perform unsupervised domain adaptation without access to source data (only a pre-trained source model), known as source-free domain adaptation. - To handle various types of category shift between source and target domains, including partial-set, open-set, and open-partial set shifts, in a unified framework.- To identify "known" samples belonging to shared source-target classes and reject "unknown" samples from novel target-only classes.- To achieve this model adaptation and "known vs unknown" separation using only standard pre-trained closed-set source models, without needing specially designed model architectures.The key hypothesis is that by combining global clustering to separate shared vs private classes along with local clustering to refine predictions, one can effectively adapt models to new target domains and tasks under varying degrees of category shift in a source-free manner.
