## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a concise yet thorough summary paragraph of the key points covered in this research paper:

This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of current methods for resolving the issue of lengthy and complex sentences through sentence compression and splitting techniques. Over 100 research papers published since 2000 are reviewed. The analysis categorizes approaches into a taxonomy, compares performance across datasets, discusses challenges around evaluation and interpretability, and highlights future research opportunities. Key findings show a rise in publications since 2005, with supervised extractive methods dominating compression and semantic-based splitting prevailing, enabled by advances in deep learning. Comparative benchmarking reveals the power of incorporating linguistic features into models, with Transformers combined with reinforcement learning demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Limitations center on the lack of meaning preservation metrics and model interpretability. Promising future directions include self-supervised methods for limited domains and optimizing the compression versus information retention trade-off. Overall, this paper serves as a valuable guide to the landscape and open problems around automating the simplification of long sentences.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of methods for dealing with long sentences, focusing on the two main approaches - sentence compression and sentence splitting. 

The key problem addressed is that long, complex sentences are difficult for humans to process and comprehend due to our limited working memory. However, people tend to use such sentences frequently in written communication. Therefore, there is a need for automated systems that can transform long sentences into shorter, simpler ones without losing the core meaning.  

The paper categorizes the main methods into a taxonomy, starting from early statistical approaches in sentence compression like noisy channel models, to optimization techniques like integer linear programming and dependency parsing, and more recent advances with deep learning models including RNNs, CNNs and Transformers. For sentence splitting, the taxonomy covers syntax-based, discourse-based and semantic-based methods. 

Through a systematic literature review methodology, the authors survey over 100 key papers on this topic. The paper provides comparative experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets showing the performance of different techniques. For sentence compression, the results indicate that incorporating syntactic features and linguistic knowledge into models like RNNs and Transformers boosts performance. In sentence splitting, while rule-based methods work for simple cases, RNNs and Transformers achieve the most consistent results across challenging datasets.

In terms of key contributions, this is the first systematic review providing comprehensive coverage of both sentence compression and splitting for dealing with long sentences. The paper provides useful taxonomies categorizing methods and comparative results analyzing performance across different models. It also discusses limitations around evaluation metrics, meaning preservation, interpretability and complexity of current techniques.

Overall, this review highlights the increasing importance of automating sentence compression and splitting to improve comprehension. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers to advance these key areas further until long sentences no longer pose barriers to effective communication.
