# [From Lengthy to Lucid: A Systematic Literature Review on NLP Techniques   for Taming Long Sentences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05172)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a concise yet thorough summary paragraph of the key points covered in this research paper:

This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive analysis of current methods for resolving the issue of lengthy and complex sentences through sentence compression and splitting techniques. Over 100 research papers published since 2000 are reviewed. The analysis categorizes approaches into a taxonomy, compares performance across datasets, discusses challenges around evaluation and interpretability, and highlights future research opportunities. Key findings show a rise in publications since 2005, with supervised extractive methods dominating compression and semantic-based splitting prevailing, enabled by advances in deep learning. Comparative benchmarking reveals the power of incorporating linguistic features into models, with Transformers combined with reinforcement learning demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. Limitations center on the lack of meaning preservation metrics and model interpretability. Promising future directions include self-supervised methods for limited domains and optimizing the compression versus information retention trade-off. Overall, this paper serves as a valuable guide to the landscape and open problems around automating the simplification of long sentences.
