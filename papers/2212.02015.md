# [Learning Imbalanced Data with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02015)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively train Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed datasets?

The key points are:

- ViTs require a lot of data to train well, but perform poorly when trained on long-tailed datasets directly with label supervision. 

- The authors propose a two-stage approach called LiVT:
  - Stage 1 uses Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) to learn generalized features in a self-supervised manner, which is robust to data imbalance.
  - Stage 2 uses a novel Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (Bal-BCE) loss to fine-tune the classifier, which corrects the inherent bias in standard BCE.

- MGP avoids the toxic influence of imbalanced labels on feature learning. Experiments show MGP extracts similar quality features when trained on balanced vs imbalanced datasets.

- Bal-BCE adds calibrated logit margins to compensate for the imbalance. This allows ViTs to converge quickly and focus on minority classes.

- Without extra data, LiVT achieves state-of-the-art results training ViTs from scratch on various long-tailed benchmarks.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that decoupling feature learning (via MGP) from classifier training (via Bal-BCE) enables effective end-to-end training of ViTs on long-tailed data. The two-stage LiVT approach is shown to outperform prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors systematically investigate training Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed datasets. Prior work has typically used ViTs pretrained on large balanced datasets like ImageNet, which can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper provides a strong baseline for training and evaluating ViTs on long-tailed data.

2. The paper proposes a two-stage approach called LiVT - Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) followed by Balanced Fine Tuning (BFT). 

- MGP shows that masked autoencoding is robust to class imbalance and avoids the toxic influence of imbalanced labels on feature learning. This is an empirical finding compared to supervised pretraining.

- For BFT, the authors propose a Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy loss (Bal-BCE) to train the classifier head. This is derived with theoretical grounding to compensate for the inherent bias in standard BCE on imbalanced data.

3. Extensive experiments show LiVT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple long-tailed recognition benchmarks, outperforming prior ResNet-based methods as well as vanilla ViT training baselines by significant margins. The improved results are achieved without any additional data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, the key novelty is in successfully training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed data through a simple and effective recipe, backed by both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis. The strong experimental results also validate the effectiveness of this approach for long-tailed recognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage method called LiVT to train Vision Transformers from scratch on long-tailed data, using masked generative pretraining and a novel balanced binary cross-entropy loss which compensates extra logit margins based on theoretical derivations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research in long-tailed recognition:

- This paper focuses on training Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed data. Most prior work has focused on CNNs like ResNet, so this provides a new perspective on the problem using a different model architecture. 

- The two-stage training pipeline of masked generative pre-training followed by balanced fine-tuning is novel compared to prior approaches. The masked pre-training helps learn more generalized features robust to the label distribution.

- The proposed balanced binary cross-entropy loss is theoretically motivated to correct inherent biases when using sigmoid outputs with ViTs. This is a new loss formulation not explored by other methods.

- Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to prior work when training ViTs from scratch on several long-tailed recognition benchmarks. Many prior methods rely on pre-trained weights or ensemble models which is not done here.

- The method does not require additional data beyond the long-tailed training set. Some prior work uses extra balanced data or leverages ImageNet pre-training which may give an unfair advantage.

Overall, this paper provides a new perspective on long-tailed recognition by successfully training ViTs from scratch. The proposed training procedure and balanced loss are tailored for ViTs and demonstrate superior performance to prior state-of-the-art methods in several experiments. The approach trains only using the long-tailed data itself without relying on extra data sources.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Exploring other architectures for the masked generative pretraining stage besides standard ViTs, such as Swin Transformers. The authors suggest the inductive biases of different architectures may impact how robust they are to long-tailed distributions during pretraining.

- Investigating other pretraining objectives besides masked image modeling that could produce generalized features invariant to class distribution. The authors note contrastive learning may be one avenue but requires more exploration to work well with ViTs on long-tailed data. 

- Studying whether it is possible to train the classifier and feature encoder jointly rather than through a two-stage approach. The authors mention memory limitations make this challenging but it could be a promising direction.

- Extending the balanced BCE loss to collaborate better with techniques like negative tolerant regularization. The authors found their proposed bias term did not combine well with this technique for reducing dominance of negative classes.

- Applying LiVT to other long-tailed recognition tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection or semantic segmentation, where class imbalance also exists.

- Evaluating the approach on larger and more complex long-tailed datasets. The authors note most experiments are on relatively small datasets for ViTs like ImageNet-LT.

- Reducing the need for hyperparameter tuning, especially the tau term that controls the bias strength. Automated tuning or adaptive methods could help improve generalizability.

In summary, the main future directions focus on architecture choices, different pretraining objectives, end-to-end joint training, extending the balanced BCE loss, applying to other tasks, evaluating on larger datasets, and reducing hyperparameter sensitivity. The authors propose LiVT provides a strong baseline for further exploring ViTs on long-tailed recognition problems.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes Learning Imbalanced Data with Vision Transformers (LiVT) to train Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed datasets. It consists of Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) and Balanced Fine Tuning (BFT). MGP reconstructs masked image regions using a lightweight decoder, which learns robust features independent of class imbalance. BFT trains a classifier head using a novel Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (Bal-BCE) loss derived from theoretical analysis. Bal-BCE compensates extra logit margins to overcome inherent bias towards head classes. Extensive experiments show LiVT outperforms comparable methods by large margins across benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art for long-tailed recognition. Notably, LiVT trains ViTs effectively from scratch without any additional data. The effectiveness of MGP and Bal-BCE are analyzed thoroughly.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called LiVT (Learn imbalanced data with Vision Transformers) to train Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed recognition tasks. Long-tailed recognition refers to classification problems where there is an imbalanced distribution of data across classes, with a few "head" classes having lots of data and a long "tail" of classes with little data. ViTs have shown great performance on balanced datasets, but struggled when trained directly on long-tailed data. 

LiVT has two main components: Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) and Balanced Fine Tuning (BFT). MGP trains a ViT autoencoder on masked images in a self-supervised way, allowing it to learn generalized features regardless of class label distribution. BFT then trains a classifier head using a novel Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy loss function derived in the paper. This allows the model to overcome inherent biases toward head classes in the sigmoid activation typically used with binary cross-entropy. Experiments show LiVT is able to train ViTs from scratch and achieve state-of-the-art performance on several long-tailed benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior ViT training methods. The ability to effectively train ViTs on imbalanced real-world data makes this an important contribution.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes a method called LiVT (Learning imbalanced data with Vision Transformers) to train Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed datasets. The main ideas are:

1. Use masked generative pretraining (MGP) as the first stage to learn generalized features that are robust to label distribution. MGP reconstructs masked image patches and is shown to be effective for ViTs even with imbalanced data. 

2. Propose a balanced binary cross-entropy (Bal-BCE) loss for the second fine-tuning stage to utilize label information. A novel bias term is derived to compensate the inherent bias of sigmoid function towards head classes. This balances the learning and achieves state-of-the-art results.

3. The overall pipeline of LiVT first pretrains ViT encoder and lightweight decoder using MGP on the imbalanced dataset. Then the pretrained encoder is fine-tuned with the proposed Bal-BCE loss for classification. Extensive experiments show LiVT successfully trains ViTs from scratch and outperforms previous methods.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the problem of training vision transformers (ViTs) effectively on long-tailed recognition datasets. Specifically, it aims to train ViTs from scratch using only the long-tailed data, without relying on any additional pretrained weights or datasets.

The key questions/challenges it addresses are:

- ViTs typically require large datasets like ImageNet to train effectively. How can we train them well using only long-tailed datasets which have far fewer examples, especially for tail classes?

- Supervised training struggles on long-tailed data due to the imbalance. How can we train ViTs in a way that is robust to the long-tailed label distribution?

- Standard cross-entropy loss works poorly for ViTs on imbalanced data. How can we design a loss function tailored for ViTs that handles class imbalance properly?

In summary, the paper tackles the problem of how to train ViTs from scratch on long-tailed datasets, without requiring additional data, in a way that is robust to the class imbalance. The key ideas proposed are masked generative pretraining and a balanced binary cross-entropy loss.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes LiVT, a method to effectively train Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed data distributions. The authors first observe that ViTs suffer more from long-tailed recognition problems compared to CNNs like ResNet, needing both more training data and techniques to handle class imbalance. To address this, LiVT utilizes a two-stage training process. First, a Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) stage learns a robust feature representation, taking advantage of the observation that masked autoencoders like MAE are insensitive to class imbalance. Second, a Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT) stage uses a novel Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (Bal-BCE) loss to calibrate the classifier by compensating extra logit margins derived from the class prior. Experiments across datasets like ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with advantages over prior arts in utilizing long-tailed data to train ViTs from scratch. The proposed Bal-BCE loss significantly improves over BCE, with theoretical analysis of why a modified bias is required. Overall, LiVT provides an effective approach to train ViTs on imbalanced data without additional data sources.
