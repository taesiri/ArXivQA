# [Learning Imbalanced Data with Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02015)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we effectively train Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed datasets?

The key points are:

- ViTs require a lot of data to train well, but perform poorly when trained on long-tailed datasets directly with label supervision. 

- The authors propose a two-stage approach called LiVT:
  - Stage 1 uses Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) to learn generalized features in a self-supervised manner, which is robust to data imbalance.
  - Stage 2 uses a novel Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy (Bal-BCE) loss to fine-tune the classifier, which corrects the inherent bias in standard BCE.

- MGP avoids the toxic influence of imbalanced labels on feature learning. Experiments show MGP extracts similar quality features when trained on balanced vs imbalanced datasets.

- Bal-BCE adds calibrated logit margins to compensate for the imbalance. This allows ViTs to converge quickly and focus on minority classes.

- Without extra data, LiVT achieves state-of-the-art results training ViTs from scratch on various long-tailed benchmarks.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that decoupling feature learning (via MGP) from classifier training (via Bal-BCE) enables effective end-to-end training of ViTs on long-tailed data. The two-stage LiVT approach is shown to outperform prior methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors systematically investigate training Vision Transformers (ViTs) from scratch on long-tailed datasets. Prior work has typically used ViTs pretrained on large balanced datasets like ImageNet, which can lead to unfair comparisons. This paper provides a strong baseline for training and evaluating ViTs on long-tailed data.

2. The paper proposes a two-stage approach called LiVT - Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) followed by Balanced Fine Tuning (BFT). 

- MGP shows that masked autoencoding is robust to class imbalance and avoids the toxic influence of imbalanced labels on feature learning. This is an empirical finding compared to supervised pretraining.

- For BFT, the authors propose a Balanced Binary Cross-Entropy loss (Bal-BCE) to train the classifier head. This is derived with theoretical grounding to compensate for the inherent bias in standard BCE on imbalanced data.

3. Extensive experiments show LiVT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple long-tailed recognition benchmarks, outperforming prior ResNet-based methods as well as vanilla ViT training baselines by significant margins. The improved results are achieved without any additional data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

In summary, the key novelty is in successfully training ViTs from scratch on long-tailed data through a simple and effective recipe, backed by both empirical evidence and theoretical analysis. The strong experimental results also validate the effectiveness of this approach for long-tailed recognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a two-stage method called LiVT to train Vision Transformers from scratch on long-tailed data, using masked generative pretraining and a novel balanced binary cross-entropy loss which compensates extra logit margins based on theoretical derivations.
