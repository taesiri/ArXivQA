# [Osmosis: RGBD Diffusion Prior for Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14837)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Restoring underwater images is challenging due to strong attenuation and scattering effects that exponentially increase with depth, causing color distortion and contrast loss. 
- Lack of ground truth data of clean underwater scenes further exacerbates the problem.
- Existing methods have limitations in forming strong image priors or require supervised training data.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose an unsupervised restoration method based on a diffusion prior trained on joint color and depth images of natural outdoor scenes.
- Leverage available RGBD datasets captured in air to train the prior, overcoming lack of underwater ground truth.
- Jointly model color and depth in the prior to better capture their inherent correlations in natural images.
- Use the underwater image formation model to form a likelihood term for posterior sampling along with the RGBD prior.
- Iteratively estimate the clean color image, depth map and physical model parameters from a single degraded input image.

Main Contributions:
- First to train an RGBD prior and show modeling color and depth jointly provides a stronger diffusion prior for restoration.
- Propose a new method combining the RGBD prior of in-air data with underwater image formation model for diffusion-based sampling.
- Demonstrate state-of-the-art underwater image restoration qualitatively and quantitatively on real and simulated data, without using underwater images for training.

In summary, this paper presents a novel unsupervised approach for underwater image restoration by leveraging diffusion priors trained on RGBD images of natural scenes. The key insight is that joint modeling of color and depth better constrains the solution space while the physical image formation model provides further guidance during sampling. Impressive results are shown, outperforming previous supervised and unsupervised methods.
