# [Instruct-SCTG: Guiding Sequential Controlled Text Generation through   Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality and coherent text with a specific discourse structure is challenging. For example, a news article should have a logical flow going from introducing the main event, to describing context and consequences, to providing commentary. 
- Existing language models struggle to impose a given discourse structure during text generation in a controllable manner.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Instruct-SCTG, a framework to guide language models to generate text adhering to a given discourse structure. 
- The key idea is to decompose the generation into sentence-level sub-tasks, where each sentence is generated to match a specific discourse role based on instructions.
- The framework utilizes instruction-tuned language models as backbone generators to produce text sequentially section by section. 
- The instructions specify the discourse context, desired role for the next section, and generated text so far to provide necessary context.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a straightforward yet effective framework to impose discourse structure during text generation by sequentially instructing language models.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlled generation of news articles and recipes with coherence discourse structure.  
- Introduces a novel metric, positional divergence, to automatically measure adherence to discourse structure in a fuzzy manner.
- First work to explore the design of instructions to guide discourse structure during generation.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate improved coherence of generated text on three datasets from news and recipe domains.
