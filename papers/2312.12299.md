# [Instruct-SCTG: Guiding Sequential Controlled Text Generation through   Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12299)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating high-quality and coherent text with a specific discourse structure is challenging. For example, a news article should have a logical flow going from introducing the main event, to describing context and consequences, to providing commentary. 
- Existing language models struggle to impose a given discourse structure during text generation in a controllable manner.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Instruct-SCTG, a framework to guide language models to generate text adhering to a given discourse structure. 
- The key idea is to decompose the generation into sentence-level sub-tasks, where each sentence is generated to match a specific discourse role based on instructions.
- The framework utilizes instruction-tuned language models as backbone generators to produce text sequentially section by section. 
- The instructions specify the discourse context, desired role for the next section, and generated text so far to provide necessary context.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a straightforward yet effective framework to impose discourse structure during text generation by sequentially instructing language models.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlled generation of news articles and recipes with coherence discourse structure.  
- Introduces a novel metric, positional divergence, to automatically measure adherence to discourse structure in a fuzzy manner.
- First work to explore the design of instructions to guide discourse structure during generation.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate improved coherence of generated text on three datasets from news and recipe domains.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework called Instruct-SCTG that leverages instruction-tuned language models to generate text with improved discourse structure and coherence by decomposing the generation task into a sequence of sub-tasks guided by natural language instructions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are three-fold:

1. The authors propose a straightforward yet effective framework called Instruct-SCTG that leverages instruction-following language models to generate structurally coherent texts in the task of Sequential Controlled Text Generation (SCTG). Their framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on SCTG tasks in both news and recipe domains. 

2. They introduce a novel automatic metric called "positional divergence" to effectively measure the fuzzy adherence of discourse structure in generated text. 

3. Their work is the first to explore the design of instructions to exert control over the underlying discourse structure during text generation.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this work include:

- Sequential controlled text generation (SCTG)
- Discourse structure
- Instruction-tuned language models
- Natural language instructions
- News article generation
- Recipe generation  
- Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
- Zero-shot prompting
- Positional discourse divergence - an automatic evaluation metric proposed in the paper
- Coherence and fluency evaluations
- Controlled text generation

The paper introduces an effective framework called "Instruct-SCTG" that leverages instruction-following language models to generate texts with improved discourse structure and coherence. The key ideas include:

- Breaking down text generation into sentence-level sub-tasks 
- Guiding language models sequentially through natural language instructions
- Comparing different levels of exposed discourse context during tuning
- Proposing a new automatic metric to measure discourse divergence
- Conducting experiments on news and recipe datasets
- Achieving state-of-the-art performance in imposing discourse structure

In summary, the core focus is on controlling discourse structure in text generation using instructions and fine-tuned or zero-shot LLMs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a sequential framework called Instruct-SCTG that leverages instruction-tuned language models to generate structurally coherent text. Can you explain in more detail how this framework works and how it differs from previous approaches for controlled text generation? 

2. The instruction tuning process involves creating prompt-paragraph pairs with different levels of discourse context exposure (local, past-aware, full-sequence). What is the rationale behind exploring these different contextual settings and what were the key findings in how they impact overall coherence?

3. The paper proposes a new automatic evaluation metric called Positional Divergence that measures discourse divergence in a fuzzy manner. What are the limitations of using exact match accuracy that this new metric aims to address? How is the positional divergence calculated?

4. The Instruct-SCTG framework is evaluated on three datasets from news and recipe domains. Why were these domains selected and what modifications were required to adapt the framework and tuning process to each one? 

5. What were the key results demonstrating Instruct-SCTG's ability to control discourse structure in the generated text? How did the fine-tuned vs zero-shot setups compare in balancing fluency and coherence?

6. For the news domain experiments, the paper utilizes an existing functional discourse schema. Can you explain this schema and the discourse roles that were defined? How suitable is this schema for the news article structure?

7. The paper acknowledges some limitations around potential inaccuracies in generated content and constraints around maximum sequence lengths. How could these issues be addressed in future work?

8. The framework evaluation relies on both automatic metrics and human evaluation. What are the tradeoffs between these approaches? Do you think any additional metrics are needed to assess quality?

9. The approach involves decomposition into sentence-level generation tasks. Do you think this framework could be applied to other levels of linguistic units like paragraphs or documents? What changes would be required?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on discourse structure coherence. What other attributes of text could instruction-tuned models potentially control, and how might the prompting approach differ?
