# [Reinforcement Learning for Conversational Question Answering over   Knowledge Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08460)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on conversational question answering over law knowledge bases (KBs). While existing methods can handle single-turn questions relatively well, they struggle with multi-turn conversations where the input questions tend to be noisy and ambiguous. These methods often make assumptions about input clarity and user intent that do not hold true for real-world scenarios. So there is a need for models that can have more natural conversations and provide answers from law KBs even when inputs are unclear.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose using reinforcement learning for conversational question answering. An RL agent learns to navigate the law KB graph to find answers based on current input and conversation history. This allows adaptive behavior even for noisy input questions. 

Key Details:
- Encode question with BERT + LSTM to incorporate conversation history 
- Formulate KB navigation as Markov Decision Process
- Define states, actions, rewards, policy network for RL agent
- Agent takes actions to traverse graph, aims to maximize reward 
- Train with REINFORCE algorithm

Main Contributions:
1) Novel application of RL for conversational QA over law KBs 
2) RL agent learns to handle noisy/unclear questions by using conversation history
3) Proposed encoders to represent questions and conversation context
4) Evaluation on real-world datasets shows improved performance over baselines

In summary, the paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework to make conversational QA models over law KBs more robust to ambiguous inputs, by having the agent learn to leverage context from the conversation history. Experiments demonstrate the promise of this approach.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework for conversational question answering over law knowledge graphs, which uses an LSTM-based question encoder to incorporate conversational history and trains an RL agent to navigate the KG to find answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel iterative reinforcement learning framework for conversational question answering over law knowledge graphs. Specifically:

- They introduce a method to encode the conversational history using an LSTM in order to handle incomplete and ungrammatical natural language inputs that are common in legal conversations. 

- They formulate the process of identifying the answer entity within the knowledge graph as a Markov Decision Process and design a policy network to learn how to navigate the graph.

- They apply the REINFORCE algorithm to train the model to maximize anticipated rewards in delivering optimal answers across conversations.

- They demonstrate through experiments on real-world datasets that their proposed approach can outperform existing baseline methods on some key metrics like Hit@5 and Mean Reciprocal Rank.

In summary, the key innovation is in adapting reinforcement learning, which has been extensively studied for non-conversational question answering, to the setting of multi-turn conversational question answering over legal knowledge graphs. Their model learns to leverage conversation history to handle noisy inputs and navigate the complex knowledge graph to find answers.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions encoding context using BERT to obtain token embeddings. What were the motivations behind choosing BERT over other language models? What adjustments, if any, were made to the standard BERT architecture or fine-tuning approach?

2. The paper uses an LSTM to encode conversational history. What were the reasons for selecting an LSTM over other sequence models like transformers? Were any modifications made to the standard LSTM or was a vanilla implementation used? 

3. The core of the paper is framing the problem as an MDP and using reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy. What alternative problem formulations or learning paradigms were considered? What were the advantages of the RL+MDP approach over those alternatives that led the authors to select this method?

4. The paper defines a custom state representation, action space, reward function and transition dynamics for the MDP. What design choices and tradeoffs went into formulating each of those MDP components? How do those choices impact learning and performance?  

5. The policy network uses a specific neural architecture involving entity/relation embeddings, LSTM encoders and feedforward layers. What was the motivation and intuition behind this architecture? Were any alternative network architectures explored? What were their limitations?

6. The training process uses the REINFORCE algorithm. Why was REINFORCE preferred over other policy gradient methods or actor-critic style algorithms? What adjustments, if any, were made to the vanilla REINFORCE algorithm?

7. What additional learning algorithms or training techniques, such as curiosity-driven exploration, prioritized experience replay, or auxiliary losses, could potentially improve the training process? Why weren't those methods included and could integrating them provide benefits?

8. How was the model evaluation strategy designed? What metrics were selected and why? Are there any limitations of the evaluation approach the authors used?

9. The related work section mentions several alternative approaches for conversational QA. What are some key advantages the proposed RL method has over those existing methods? What task-specific challenges does the RL approach help mitigate?

10. The conclusion states that the method outperforms baselines on some metrics. What were the metrics that the RL method failed to outperform baselines on? What are some possible reasons for why the RL method fell short on those metrics?
