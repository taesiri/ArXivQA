# [Gradient Boosting Neural Networks: GrowNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07971)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper aims to address is:How can we combine the power of gradient boosting with the flexibility and versatility of neural networks? More specifically, the authors propose a novel modeling paradigm called GrowNet that builds neural networks layer-by-layer using the idea of gradient boosting. Instead of decision trees which are commonly used in gradient boosting methods like XGBoost, the authors use shallow neural networks as the weak learners that are added sequentially. The key ideas and hypotheses tested in this paper are:- Gradient boosting can be adapted to incrementally build deep neural networks by using shallow NNs as weak learners instead of decision trees. - Stacking features from the penultimate layer of each shallow NN as additional input for training subsequent learners improves information propagation.- A corrective step to update parameters of all previous learners prevents getting stuck in local optima. - Second-order optimization and dynamically updating the boosting rate further improves performance.- This approach can be generalized to various ML tasks like classification, regression and ranking.So in summary, the central hypothesis is around combining boosting with NNs to grow complex models, and the paper aims to demonstrate the viability of this approach across multiple tasks. The novelty lies in using boosting to construct DNNs layer-by-layer as opposed to standard end-to-end training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:- Proposing a novel gradient boosting framework called GrowNet that uses shallow neural networks as weak learners instead of decision trees. - Developing a general framework that can be readily adapted for different machine learning tasks like classification, regression, and learning to rank.- Introducing innovations like adding second order statistics to the training process and a global corrective step to refine and tune the model. - Demonstrating through experiments that GrowNet achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art boosting methods like XGBoost and AdaNet on multiple real-world datasets across the tasks of classification, regression, and learning to rank.- Performing an ablation study to analyze the impact of different components of GrowNet like the corrective step, dynamic boost rate, stacked features, etc.In summary, the key contribution appears to be proposing a novel paradigm of gradient boosting neural networks that can incrementally build deep neural networks in a layer-wise fashion and showing its effectiveness across diverse ML tasks compared to existing boosting techniques. The framework is flexible, faster to train, and achieves strong performance.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:- The idea of using gradient boosting with neural networks as weak learners is novel. Most prior work on gradient boosting uses decision trees as weak learners (e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost). Using shallow neural networks provides more flexibility and modeling power. - The proposed GrowNet framework is more general than some prior work on combining neural nets with boosting. For example, some papers have looked at boosting CNNs for specific computer vision tasks. GrowNet provides a unified framework for classification, regression, and ranking across multiple domains.- The use of second order gradient statistics and the corrective step helps improve on traditional greedy gradient boosting. These innovations seem unique to GrowNet and theoretically grounded. The ablation studies demonstrate their benefits empirically.- Compared to end-to-end deep neural networks, GrowNet provides a more modular, interpretable model that is faster and easier to train. The layer-by-layer boosting approach is more efficient than tuning a monolithic DNN.- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to XGBoost and AdaNet across the tasks and datasets tested. This shows the viability of the proposed techniques.Overall, GrowNet introduces some novel ideas to combinine the strengths of gradient boosting and neural networks. The general framework, training procedure innovations, and experimental results help advance research at the intersection of these two popular machine learning techniques. The paper makes both theoretical and empirical contributions to the field.
