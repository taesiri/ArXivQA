# [The Cadaver in the Machine: The Social Practices of Measurement and   Validation in Motion Capture Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10877)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Motion capture systems make assumptions about human bodies and movement that can lead to harms, but these assumptions are often hidden. 
- The paper argues that the practices of measurement and validation in motion capture technology design carry forward and entrench assumptions over time.
- Revealing these assumptions is crucial for ensuring motion capture systems function properly and avoid harming marginalized groups.

Approach: 
- The authors use social practice theory as an analytical lens. This views practices (like measurement and validation) as made up of linked elements of materials, competences, and meanings. 
- They conduct a systematic literature review of motion capture research since the 1930s related to measurement, validation, and errors.
- They identify 3 historical eras in motion capture research centered on different error types. Each era reveals assumptions coming from practices of measurement and validation.

Key Findings:
- Early motion capture work (1930s-1970s) focused on anthropometric measurement and body segment parameter estimation, baking in assumptions of studying only male, white, and slim subjects.
- The next era (1980s-1990s) standardized marker-based motion capture, further entrenching assumptions about bodies via practices managing errors like soft tissue artifacts.  
- The current era sees focus on algorithmic errors and validating new systems against "gold standards," propagating problematic assumptions. 
- Across eras, validation practices emphasize agreement with past work rather than interrogating assumptions about standard bodies. There is little subgroup validity testing.

Contributions:
- The paper demonstrates how assumptions become embedded and stabilized over time via the linked social practices of measurement and validation in motion capture research and design.
- It provides a useful analytical template to excavate assumptions in other sociotechnical systems using social practice theory and attention to errors.
- Understanding these hidden assumptions is crucial for ensuring accountable, unbiased technologies that avoid harming marginalized groups.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

Using social practice theory, this paper examines the history of motion capture technology to reveal how measurement and validation practices over time have embedded problematic assumptions about bodies that continue to shape the design and use of these systems today.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper offers three main contributions:

1. It provides a template for using social practice theory to analyze the assumptions and historical development of technologies like motion capture. Specifically, it examines the social practices of measurement and validation that become stabilized in motion capture systems over time. 

2. Through a systematic literature review, it uncovers three eras in the history of motion capture (Foundation, Standardization, Innovation) that center on different error types. This historical analysis of errors reveals shifting assumptions and stabilization of practices across these eras.

3. It argues that understanding the social practices and assumptions underlying technologies like motion capture is crucial for building accountability. In particular, it can inform auditing approaches and help identify contexts where motion capture systems should not be uncritically deployed due to lack of subgroup validity testing.

In summary, this paper demonstrates how a social practice theory lens focused on errors can excavate assumptions in sociotechnical systems, which is key for responsible and ethical technology design as well as auditing. The historical analysis serves as a template for interrogating other technologies through attention to their core social practices.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using social practice theory as a lens to analyze the history of motion capture technology. How well does this theory account for the complex sociotechnical factors that shape technology practices over time? Does it overlook any key elements that contribute to the assumptions embedded in motion capture systems?

2. The authors conduct a systematic literature review to trace the history of measurement and validation practices in motion capture. What are some limitations of relying solely on published academic literature to construct an historical account? What other data sources could supplement this analysis?  

3. The paper categorizes the history of motion capture into three eras based on stabilizing practices related to certain error types. Is this categorization appropriate and adequately supported by the evidence presented? Could alternative historical frameworks be proposed?

4. Errors are proposed as a useful entry point for interrogating practices and assumptions. However, how might focusing narrowly on errors exclude other perspectives that could reveal additional insights? What complementary analytical lenses could be adopted?

5. The analysis reveals problematic assumptions about bodies embedded in motion capture systems. However, how well does this analysis account for the ideologies, politics, and power dynamics that perpetuate such assumptions? 

6. The paper argues social practices can become "infrastructural" over time, carrying assumptions forward. What evidence supports the claim that early motion capture assumptions persist in contemporary systems? Could assumptions not also change significantly over time along with practices?

7. The analysis links assumptions about bodies to potential harms from motion capture systems. However, what concrete evidence demonstrates tangible harms resulting directly from the assumptions identified? 

8. The paper proposes social practice analysis as a prerequisite for auditing AI systems like motion capture. However, what aspects of this analysis would need to be adapted to create actionable audits for practitioners?

9. The analysis reveals insufficient subgroup validity testing in motion capture research. However, what evidence confirms this translates to biases embedded in real-world deployments of these systems?

10. The paper focuses narrowly on motion capture practices. How well could this analytical approach transfer to interrogating assumptions and social practices in other sociotechnical systems? What adaptations would be required?
