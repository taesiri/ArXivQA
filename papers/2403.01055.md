# [Towards Full Authorship with AI: Supporting Revision with AI-Generated   Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01055)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are shaping a new UI paradigm where users generate text through prompts. However, this diminishes user creativity/independence in writing by shifting creative control from the user to the system.  

Proposed Solution:
- The authors introduce Textfocals, a UI prototype to support a human-centered approach that emphasizes the user's role in writing. 
- Textfocals provides LLM-generated summaries, questions and advice (LLM views) in a sidebar to encourage reflection and discovery to guide self-driven revisions without direct text generation.  
- Key UI affordances:
   - Contextually adaptive views based on user's text
   - Scaffolding for prompt selection/customization to interact with LLM while maintaining authorship

Contributions:
- Design and implementation of Textfocals prototype with the above UI affordances
- Formative user study insights:
   - LLM views helped users develop ideas, cater to audience, clarify writing
   - Design challenges w.r.t. document navigation, prompt engineering, context management

Main conclusion: 
- Work highlights the breadth of design possibilities for writing support tools powered by AI that maintain authorship integrity.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Textfocals, a UI prototype of a writing tool that provides AI-generated summaries, questions, and advice in the sidebar of a text editor to encourage user reflection and discovery for making independent revisions while maintaining full authorship.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The design and implementation of Textfocals, a UI prototype for a writing tool that facilitates reflection and discovery to support making independent revisions in writing. Key features include:

- Scaffolding with predefined prompts that users can select or customize to generate LLM views rather than text.

- A sidebar that presents LLM-generated views (summaries, questions, advice) contextually adapted to the part of the text the user is revising.

2. Formative insights from a pilot user study indicating that Textfocals' LLM views can help users develop underdeveloped ideas, cater to their rhetorical audience, and improve clarity in their writing while maintaining creative control.

So in summary, the paper introduces a new interaction paradigm and interface for leveraging large language models to empower users' writing process rather than replace their authorship. The interface shows promise for supporting reflection and discovery that enables users to make revisions independently.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper content, some of the key keywords or terms associated with this paper include:

- Human-centered AI
- Human-LLM interaction
- Writing tools
- Revision
- Reflection 
- Discovery
- Authorship
- Autonomy
- User interface design
- Large language models (LLMs)

The paper introduces a UI prototype called Textfocals that is designed to support the writing process by providing LLM-generated summaries, questions, and advice to encourage reflection and discovery for making revisions, while maintaining the user's authorship and creative control. The prototype and an initial user study explore the design space around using LLMs to facilitate human reflection and discovery for independent and self-directed writing revision.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I have formulated about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The authors introduce "Textfocals" as a UI prototype to maintain user authorship when interacting with large language models. What are some ways the interaction design could have provided more scaffolding for users to truly own the revision process rather than rely on the AI?

2. The predefined prompts aim to encourage the AI to generate "views" rather than text, but could these prompts have incorporated more explicit instructions or constraints against the AI generating original text ideas? How might the prompts be improved?  

3. The authors identify reflection and discovery as key cognitive processes for revision. What other cognitive processes are important and how might the prototype better support those?

4. The prompts are categorized as summary, inquisitive, and advisory views. What other categories of views could facilitate the revision process for writers and how would those view prompts need to be designed?

5. The authors acknowledge the context length limits of current AI models. How viable is a contextual adaptation approach if models cannot take advantage of full document context? What alternative interaction approaches might address this?

6. The study revealed participants wanted the AI to provide examples when giving advice. What are some ways the system could automatically generate examples or otherwise provide additional scaffolding to help writers apply the advice?  

7. The interface uses highlighting to relate views to document sections, but participants found this confusing. What alternative visualization approaches should the authors have considered to establish clearer relationships?

8. Participants were confused about what scope of text was being provided as input to the AI. How could the interface better communicate input scope? What controls might help users specify scope?

9. Prompt flexibility was challenging for users. Beyond fill-in-the-blank approaches, what other methods could make it easier for non-experts to create and manage custom prompts? 

10. How can the contextual needs revealed in the study best inform the design of future AI writing assistants? What key contextual parameters should these tools allow users to specify?
