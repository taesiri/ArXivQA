# [Decomposition for Enhancing Attention: Improving LLM-based Text-to-SQL   through Workflow Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10671)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In-context learning with large language models (LLMs) has shown promising results on NLP tasks, but faces challenges in complex tasks like text-to-SQL. 
- Issues like attention diffusion and inadequate performance arise with the single-step chain-of-thought prompting approach commonly used.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a workflow paradigm method based on decomposition to enhance the attention and problem-solving scope of LLMs in text-to-SQL.  
- It consists of 5 modules - Information Determination, Classification & Hint, SQL Generation, Self-Correction, and Active Learning.

Key Contributions:
- A two-stage information determination module that focuses attention by reducing interference information. Adapts to realistic questions with different questioning styles.
- A new prompt structure that categorizes problems and uses different prompt patterns to present key information explicitly. 
- Integration of self-correction and active learning modules to further improve the model by expanding the problem-solving scope.

- Achieves state-of-the-art results on Spider dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods. About 2-3 percentage point improvements on Spider-Dev and Spider-Realistic datasets.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of the attention-focused workflow paradigm in improving overall performance compared to single-step prompting.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel workflow paradigm solution for text-to-SQL that decomposes the problem to enhance attention of LLMs. Through comprehensive experiments, it shows superior performance over strong baselines and provides a new direction for prompting complex tasks.
