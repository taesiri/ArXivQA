# [Expressivity and Approximation Properties of Deep Neural Networks with   ReLU$^k$ Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16483)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper investigates the representation power and function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks employing the ReLU^k activation function, where k≥2. Prior works have shown that deep ReLU networks can effectively approximate polynomials but face limitations in representing higher degree polynomials precisely. The expressivity and approximation properties of ReLU^k networks are not well studied.

Proposed Solution:
The paper provides a comprehensive constructive proof that deep ReLU^k networks can represent global polynomials of degree up to k^L with only O(k^{Ld}) parameters by exploiting the depth. This allows establishing upper bounds on network size and number of parameters. Leveraging polynomial approximation theory, the paper shows that deep ReLU^k networks can approximate analytic functions and functions from Sobolev spaces, albeit at a suboptimal rate.  

By studying how deep ReLU^k networks can represent functions constructed by any shallow ReLU^k networks, the paper demonstrates the adaptivity of deep ReLU^k networks in approximating functions from variation spaces without precise regularity knowledge. This reveals the approximation accuracy benefits of deep architectures with ReLU^k activations.

Main Contributions:
- Constructive proof for polynomial representation of degree k^L by deep ReLU^k nets with depth L and O(k^{Ld}) parameters
- Upper bound estimations on network size and number of parameters 
- Demonstration of suboptimal approximation rates for analytic and Sobolev space functions
- Proof that deep ReLU^k nets can represent functions from shallow ReLU^k nets of any degree ≤ k^L
- Adaptive approximation capability for variation spaces without regularity knowledge

The results provide new theoretical insights into the representation power, adaptivity, and approximation strengths of deep ReLU^k networks compared to shallow counterparts. The polynomial representation methodology and parameterization analysis offer a foundation for exploring such networks' capabilities.
