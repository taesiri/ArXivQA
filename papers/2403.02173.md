# [What has LeBenchmark Learnt about French Syntax?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02173)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained acoustic models like LeBenchmark are trained on raw speech signals only, with no explicit lexical knowledge. Yet they perform surprisingly well on higher-level linguistic tasks that seem to require syntactic knowledge. So an open question is - do these models implicitly learn syntax? 

- This paper probes LeBenchmark, a pretrained French acoustic model, for syntactic information to shed light on this question. Specifically, the tasks are part-of-speech (POS) tagging and unlabeled dependency parsing.  

Methodology:
- LeBenchmark is probed by extracting token representations from the model using time alignments, and training linear classifiers on top to predict POS tags and dependency heads. This is done separately for each of the 24 layers.

- Experiments use the Orfeo French treebank of spontaneous conversational speech. POS tagging uses a 20 tag set. Dependency parsing uses a relative position encoding to cast it as sequence labeling.

Results: 
- LeBenchmark encodes syntactic information, seen via higher accuracy than random baseline. POS tagging accuracy peaks at 65.5% (layer 15), parsing at 52% (layer 14).  

- Syntactic information peaks in the middle layers, then drops sharply in later layers, contrasting with BERT where the drop is more gradual.

- The model does better at predicting local dependencies, as seen in labeled results for layer 14 parser. Still, it has some accuracy for longer distances too.

Contributions:
- First probing study of syntax for a French acoustic model, and on spontaneous speech
- Finding that syntactic information peaks in middle layers before disappearing in later layers

Overall, the paper demonstrates that despite training only on raw speech, LeBenchmark learns some amount of implicit syntactic knowledge. This peaks in the middle layers and then fades rapidly.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper probes LeBenchmark, a French pretrained acoustic model, for syntactic information by framing POS tagging and dependency parsing as sequence labeling tasks, finding that syntactic information is most present in the middle layers and disappears in the later layers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Carrying out a probing study on LeBenchmark (a French pretrained acoustic model) to assess whether it has implicitly learned syntactic information. This is the first such study (i) on French and more generally on a language other than English, (ii) using spontaneous speech rather than read speech.

2) Reporting the finding that syntax is most extractable from the middle layers of LeBenchmark and almost disappears in the final layers. Specifically, the accuracy for syntactic probing tasks peaks in the middle layers and then drops sharply in the later layers.

So in summary, the main contributions are probing a French acoustic model for the first time to show that it does encode some syntactic information, primarily in the middle layers, even though it was trained on raw speech signals.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions that syntactic information seems to almost disappear in the last layers of LeBenchmark. Why do you think this happens, given that prior work on BERT has shown a softer decrease in later layers? 

2. The paper uses a simple mean pooling strategy to aggregate frame-level representations into token-level representations. Do you think more sophisticated pooling strategies like learnable pooling or attention-based pooling could improve probing accuracy?

3. The paper shows that local syntactic information is better encoded in LeBenchmark compared to longer-distance dependencies. Could this be an artifact of the relative position encoding scheme used? How else could long-distance dependencies be encoded?

4. What are some plausible explanations why the middle layers of LeBenchmark encode syntax better than early and late layers? Does this lend credence to the hypothesis that middle layers capture more abstract representations?

5. The paper uses a linear probe for assessing syntactic information. Do you think nonlinear probes may extract more syntactic signal, or is linearity an advantage here? What are the tradeoffs?

6. What other syntactic properties besides POS and unlabeled dependencies could be probed in future work on models like LeBenchmark? For example, probe for subject-verb agreement or more fine-grained dependency labels.

7. The paper probes LeBenchmark which is pretrained only on speech. Do you think a model pretrained also on text may show different results in terms of encodability of syntax? What can we deduce about modality of supervision from this?

8. Could the sharp decrease in syntactic information in later LeBenchmark layers be an artifact of the pretraining objective? What other objectives could potentially remedy this?

9. The paper analyzes only one pretrained French model. Would probing other architectures and model sizes lend more credibility to the conclusions? What results would you expect from such experiments?

10. Do you think findings from probing of LeBenchmark on French syntax would generalize well to other languages, especially low-resource ones? What cross-lingual probing experiments could be informative?
