# [Localization with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: An Active Sensing   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09002)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an active sensing approach for uplink user localization with the aid of multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The key idea is to design the base station (BS) beamforming vector and the reflection coefficients of multiple RISs in a sequential and adaptive manner based on the received pilots over time in order to enhance localization accuracy. A long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network is developed for this purpose, which exploits temporal features from historical measurements to sequentially map to the next sensing vectors including the BS beamformer and RIS reflection coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based active RIS configuration design achieves substantially improved localization performance compared to non-adaptive benchmarks. Remarkably, a network with a single BS and multiple RISs is shown to provide higher localization accuracy than one with multiple BS anchors in certain scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of passive RISs for assisting localization. The designed active sensing strategy produces interpretable beam focusing patterns towards the user location over multiple stages. Overall, the paper illustrates the promise of leveraging machine learning and programmable wireless environments (i.e., RISs) for enabling accurate and robust localization services.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of uplink user localization in a wireless system assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The base station (BS) aims to locate a user equipment (UE) with the help of multiple RISs deployed in the area. This is challenging because it requires jointly optimizing the RIS configurations and BS beamformer over multiple measurement stages to achieve high localization accuracy.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes an active sensing strategy where the BS sequentially adjusts the RIS reflection coefficients and its beamformer based on measurements made so far to gradually improve its estimate of the UE's location. This is formulated as an optimization problem but is intractable to solve directly. Instead, a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to exploit temporal correlations and map observations to optimized RIS and BS configurations in a scalable way.

Key Contributions:

- Proposes a learning-based active sensing framework for RIS-assisted localization to sequentially design sensing vectors based on measurements.

- Employs LSTM network to capture long-term dependencies in measurements and map them to sensing configurations in a scalable fashion.

- Achieves lower localization error compared to non-active sensing methods and outperforms conventional Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao lower bound based active approach.

- Demonstrates the feasibility of a hybrid system with a single BS and multiple RISs outperforming one with multiple BSs, showing advantage of deploying RISs.

- Provides interpretable results showing beams gradually focusing on user over time.

In summary, the paper presents a data-driven active sensing strategy for RIS-assisted localization using LSTM network. It highlights the benefits of intelligent surfaces in location-aware applications.
