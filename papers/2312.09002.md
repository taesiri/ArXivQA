# [Localization with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: An Active Sensing   Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09002)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes an active sensing approach for uplink user localization with the aid of multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The key idea is to design the base station (BS) beamforming vector and the reflection coefficients of multiple RISs in a sequential and adaptive manner based on the received pilots over time in order to enhance localization accuracy. A long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network is developed for this purpose, which exploits temporal features from historical measurements to sequentially map to the next sensing vectors including the BS beamformer and RIS reflection coefficients. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based active RIS configuration design achieves substantially improved localization performance compared to non-adaptive benchmarks. Remarkably, a network with a single BS and multiple RISs is shown to provide higher localization accuracy than one with multiple BS anchors in certain scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of passive RISs for assisting localization. The designed active sensing strategy produces interpretable beam focusing patterns towards the user location over multiple stages. Overall, the paper illustrates the promise of leveraging machine learning and programmable wireless environments (i.e., RISs) for enabling accurate and robust localization services.
