# [AiRLIHockey: Highly Reactive Contact Control and Stochastic Optimal   Shooting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14964)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Air hockey requires players to react quickly and reason about stochastic puck dynamics and contact events. Autonomous systems need robust planning and control to play effectively.

Proposed Solution:
- A hierarchical framework combining stochastic optimal shooting planning and constrained model predictive control (MPC) of the mallet.

- Estimate puck state with extended Kalman filter and learned stochastic dynamics model.

- Switch between shooting, defending and preparing behaviors using a heuristic state machine. 

- Shooting:
    - Formulate as stochastic optimal control problem to find best shooting angle.
    - Solve many instances offline to train energy-based model for fast online planning.
    
- Defense/Preparation:
    - Sample-based optimization to achieve desired puck state after contact.

- MPC with constrained low-dimensional trajectory parameterization to generate smooth mallet motions reaching planned contacts, optimized using iterative sampling.

Main Contributions:
- Novel integration of offline and online techniques for reactive high-speed planning under uncertainty
- Learned stochastic dynamics model for puck state estimation
- Energy-based model rapidly plans optimal shooting angles online 
- Constrained trajectory optimization connects planned contact states
- Demonstrated simulated performance - ranked 1st out of 7 entrants

The framework combines offline and online methods to achieve effective planning and control for air hockey under uncertainty and dynamics constraints. The use of constrained stochastic optimization and learned models allows the agent to robustly react in real time. Competition results validate the approach, ranking 1st out of 7 agents.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a hierarchical framework for an air hockey playing robot that combines learned shooting angle planning, sampling-based defensive control, and model predictive trajectory optimization to achieve highly reactive mallet control.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be the development of a hierarchical framework for an air hockey playing robot that combines:

1) Stochastic optimal control for planning shooting angles. The authors formulate the search for the best shooting angle as a stochastic optimal control problem, solve these offline for a variety of scenarios, and train an energy-based model to rapidly select good shooting angles online. 

2) Sampling-based model-predictive control for generating constrained mallet trajectories at 50Hz. The authors use a trajectory parameterization and sample-based optimization to efficiently generate smooth mallet trajectories that achieve desired puck interactions while satisfying constraints.

In summary, the key contributions are the combination of offline stochastic optimal control solutions with online sampling-based planning to achieve reactive behaviors, along with the system design and validation through the air hockey competition. The proposed methods enabled their agent to win the competition against other participants.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this work include:

- Air hockey - The game environment that is the focus of this work. The paper deals with developing an agent to play air hockey.

- Stochastic optimal control - Used to formulate the shooting contact state planning as an optimization problem under uncertainty.

- Energy-based model - Trained to rapidly predict good shooting angles given a puck state, based on optimal plans computed offline.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions learning locally linear stochastic puck dynamics from simulation data. What are some of the key challenges in transferring these dynamics models to the real physical system? How can the dynamics models be adapted online to account for differences between simulation and the real system?

2. The shooting contact state is planned by formulating a stochastic optimal control problem. What are some of the advantages and limitations of this approach compared to more traditional trajectory optimization techniques? How sensitive is the performance to inaccuracies in the dynamics models used?

3. An energy-based model is used to rapidly predict good shooting angles online based on offline data. What are some of the tradeoffs in using such a learned model compared to online optimization? How was the dataset collected and what strategies were used to ensure sufficient coverage of scenarios? 

4. For defense and preparation modes, online sample-based optimization is used. What are some reasons this approach was chosen over learning a model like for shooting? What objective functions are optimized in these cases and how were they designed?

5. The mid-level mallet controller uses a trajectory parameterization to reduce dimensionality. What specific parameterization was chosen and what constraints does it naturally satisfy? What are other options for efficiently representing trajectories?

6. Model predictive control with sampling is used to optimize mallet trajectories online. What horizon lengths and sampling budgets were found to work well? How sensitive is performance based on these hyperparameters?

7. The method decomposes the problem into contact state planning and trajectory optimization. What are the advantages of this hierarchical approach? What challenges emerge from the decomposition?

8. What specific techniques are used for state estimation of the puck? How were the noise models designed and tuned? What are possible failure modes of the state estimator?

9. A heuristics-based state machine is used to switch behaviors. What triggers are used for switching and how were they designed? What are some limitations of this approach?

10. The method was evaluated in simulation and won the competition. What are some of the key challenges expected in directly transferring it to a physical system? What components would need to be retrained or adapted?
