# [Fair Clustering: A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09061)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper introduces a novel causally fair clustering approach to address limitations in existing fair clustering methods, which predominantly rely on non-causal notions of fairness. The authors show that optimizing for non-causal fairness metrics can paradoxically induce discriminatory effects from a causal perspective. To overcome this, they propose an algorithm that allows specification of which causal fairness metrics - including direct, indirect, and spurious effects - should be minimized during clustering. Their method involves optimal transport of variables to remove unfair biases, as well as excluding protected attributes from the clustering mechanism to avoid direct discrimination. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that their approach successfully minimizes specified causal unfairness metrics compared to previous clustering algorithms. By enabling precise control over minimized causal fairness notions, their method allows nuanced alignment of clustering fairness with ethical and legal standards. However, limitations exist regarding accurate knowledge of causal relationships. Overall, this work provides an important step towards causally fair unsupervised learning.
