# [FSAR: Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Adaptive Topology   Structure and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11046)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we effectively apply federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition in order to both improve performance and preserve data privacy?

The key challenges the paper identifies in doing this are:

1) The heterogeneous human topology graph structures across different datasets/clients hinders training stability when applying standard federated learning approaches. 

2) There is divergence between local client models and the global server model during federated training due to distinct updating patterns.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes:

1) An Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) module that learns both a domain-invariant topology structure to improve training stability as well as a domain-specific topology to preserve personalized knowledge on each client.

2) A Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) mechanism to align shallow block-wise motion features between clients and server to mitigate their divergence.

Through these contributions, the paper demonstrates an effective federated learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition that outperforms existing methods while preserving local data privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called FSAR for skeleton-based action recognition. The key contributions are:

- It pioneers the introduction of federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition to address privacy concerns by enabling collaborative training across clients without sharing sensitive local data.

- It identifies the heterogeneous human topology graph structure as a major obstacle causing training instability for skeleton data in federated settings. To address this, it proposes an Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) module to facilitate learning both shared and personalized topology structures.

- It further proposes a Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) mechanism to align shallow block-wise features between clients and server to mitigate their divergence and boost accuracy. 

- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FSAR. It significantly outperforms existing federated learning methods and centralized skeleton action recognition models on multiple datasets while protecting data privacy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing FSAR, a novel federated learning paradigm tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. The key innovations are the ATS and MKD modules to handle challenges caused by heterogeneous skeleton topology graphs across different clients/datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a novel federated learning framework called FSAR for skeleton-based action recognition that addresses the issue of heterogeneous human topology graphs across different datasets by learning both domain-invariant and domain-specific topologies and aligning shallow motion features between clients and server.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of federated learning for skeleton-based action recognition:

- This is one of the first papers to explore applying federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition. Most prior work has focused on standard centralized training or applying federated learning to other vision tasks like image classification. So this represents an important new direction.

- The key novelty is in identifying the heterogeneous human topology graph structure as a major obstacle for training stability in federated skeleton-based models. The proposed Adaptive Topology Structure and Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation modules provide concrete solutions to handle this challenge. 

- The Adaptive Topology Structure idea of learning a shared topology and private topology is intuitive and aligns well with the goal of federated learning - to extract common knowledge while preserving privacy. This is a clever way to adapt graph neural networks for federated settings.

- Using knowledge distillation to align shallower features is also sensible, as deeper features are more personalized while earlier layers contain more general patterns. Applying distillation in a multi-grained manner is novel.

- The experiments are quite comprehensive, testing the method on multiple datasets, comparing to other federated optimization algorithms, and ablating different components. The consistent significant gains demonstrate the effectiveness.

- The limitations around adaptive selection of distillation depth and further enhancing personalized modeling are rightly identified as areas for future work.

Overall, I think the paper makes excellent progress on an important and relatively unexplored problem. The ideas are intuitive yet effective. It clearly advances the state-of-the-art in federated skeleton-based recognition and provides a strong baseline for future efforts. The empirical validation is also convincing.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Improving the adaptiveness of the Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) mechanism to automatically select the optimal depth of feature alignment instead of manually setting it. The authors state this is a current limitation of their approach.

- Evaluating the proposed FSAR method on more complex skeleton datasets captured in unconstrained environments, like 3D pose estimation datasets from monocular videos. The current experiments are on relatively clean skeleton datasets.

- Exploring ways to make the Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) module generalizable to other graph-based tasks beyond skeleton action recognition, such as point cloud analysis, social networks, etc.

- Applying the concepts of ATS and MKD to other decentralized learning paradigms like split learning, to improve their stability and performance in dealing with non-IID heterogeneous graph data.

- Extending the FSAR framework to support personalized model training for each client, in addition to the shared global model learning. This could further enhance privacy protections.

- Reducing the communication costs between clients and server during federated learning, which is a general challenge for real-world deployment of FL systems. Data or gradient compression techniques could help in this direction.

In summary, the main future directions are around improving the adaptiveness and generalization of the proposed modules, applying them to other decentralized learning settings, supporting personalized modeling, and reducing communication costs for practical FL-based skeleton action recognition.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points in the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition (FSAR) approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning of action recognition models using decentralized skeleton data. The authors identify that heterogeneous human topology graph structures across different datasets is a key challenge that causes training instability when applying standard federated learning techniques to skeleton-based tasks. To address this, they introduce an Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) module to extract both shared and personalized topology information to improve stability while preventing negative transfer between clients. They also propose a Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) method to align shallow block-wise motion features between clients and the server to reduce divergence. Experiments on multiple skeleton datasets demonstrate that FSAR outperforms existing federated learning techniques and centralized baselines by effectively mining heterogeneous topology structures and distilling generalized motion patterns, while protecting the privacy of sensitive skeleton data.
