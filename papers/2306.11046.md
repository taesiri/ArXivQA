# [FSAR: Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Adaptive Topology   Structure and Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11046)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:

How can we effectively apply federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition in order to both improve performance and preserve data privacy?

The key challenges the paper identifies in doing this are:

1) The heterogeneous human topology graph structures across different datasets/clients hinders training stability when applying standard federated learning approaches. 

2) There is divergence between local client models and the global server model during federated training due to distinct updating patterns.

To address these challenges, the paper proposes:

1) An Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) module that learns both a domain-invariant topology structure to improve training stability as well as a domain-specific topology to preserve personalized knowledge on each client.

2) A Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) mechanism to align shallow block-wise motion features between clients and server to mitigate their divergence.

Through these contributions, the paper demonstrates an effective federated learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition that outperforms existing methods while preserving local data privacy.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel federated learning framework called FSAR for skeleton-based action recognition. The key contributions are:

- It pioneers the introduction of federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition to address privacy concerns by enabling collaborative training across clients without sharing sensitive local data.

- It identifies the heterogeneous human topology graph structure as a major obstacle causing training instability for skeleton data in federated settings. To address this, it proposes an Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) module to facilitate learning both shared and personalized topology structures.

- It further proposes a Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) mechanism to align shallow block-wise features between clients and server to mitigate their divergence and boost accuracy. 

- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FSAR. It significantly outperforms existing federated learning methods and centralized skeleton action recognition models on multiple datasets while protecting data privacy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing FSAR, a novel federated learning paradigm tailored for skeleton-based action recognition. The key innovations are the ATS and MKD modules to handle challenges caused by heterogeneous skeleton topology graphs across different clients/datasets.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a novel federated learning framework called FSAR for skeleton-based action recognition that addresses the issue of heterogeneous human topology graphs across different datasets by learning both domain-invariant and domain-specific topologies and aligning shallow motion features between clients and server.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of federated learning for skeleton-based action recognition:

- This is one of the first papers to explore applying federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition. Most prior work has focused on standard centralized training or applying federated learning to other vision tasks like image classification. So this represents an important new direction.

- The key novelty is in identifying the heterogeneous human topology graph structure as a major obstacle for training stability in federated skeleton-based models. The proposed Adaptive Topology Structure and Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation modules provide concrete solutions to handle this challenge. 

- The Adaptive Topology Structure idea of learning a shared topology and private topology is intuitive and aligns well with the goal of federated learning - to extract common knowledge while preserving privacy. This is a clever way to adapt graph neural networks for federated settings.

- Using knowledge distillation to align shallower features is also sensible, as deeper features are more personalized while earlier layers contain more general patterns. Applying distillation in a multi-grained manner is novel.

- The experiments are quite comprehensive, testing the method on multiple datasets, comparing to other federated optimization algorithms, and ablating different components. The consistent significant gains demonstrate the effectiveness.

- The limitations around adaptive selection of distillation depth and further enhancing personalized modeling are rightly identified as areas for future work.

Overall, I think the paper makes excellent progress on an important and relatively unexplored problem. The ideas are intuitive yet effective. It clearly advances the state-of-the-art in federated skeleton-based recognition and provides a strong baseline for future efforts. The empirical validation is also convincing.
