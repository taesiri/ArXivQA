# [The Risk of Federated Learning to Skew Fine-Tuning Features and   Underperform Out-of-Distribution Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14027)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models are typically deployed in two phases - pre-training on a large corpus to acquire broad language knowledge, followed by fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets. However, fine-tuning datasets often have scarcity and privacy issues. 
- Federated learning has emerged as a solution by enabling collaborative modeling while keeping data decentralized. However, the impact of federated fine-tuning on model robustness is not well understood.

- This paper investigates: Does federated fine-tuning negatively impact out-of-distribution robustness of models?

Approach: 
- Introduces 3 robustness indicators related to diversity, transferability and deviation in the model's feature space - Singular Value Entropy (SVE), Largest Singular Value Ratio (LSVR) and Gradient Deviation Angle (GDA).

- Conducts experiments by fine-tuning RoBERTa on Amazon reviews (in-distribution) and testing on DynaSent, SemEval and SST (out-of-distribution) under different levels of data heterogeneity.

Observations:
- With increasing heterogeneity, accuracy drops sharply on OOD datasets but not on Amazon. Feature indicators show loss of diversity and transferability. 

- Different parameter-efficient methods like BitFit, LoRA etc. show varying robustness. BitFit works best.

Proposed Solution:
- Proposes GNP - a General Noisy Projection based robust algorithm 

- Projects fine-tuned model onto pre-trained model to obtain a robustness vector  

- Uses SVE, LSVR, GDA to formulate a value model to balance accuracy and robustness

- Introduces Gaussian noise into updates to enhance diversity

Results:
- Improves robustness across OOD datasets and heterogeneity levels without compromising Amazon accuracy

- Works well across different parameter-efficient methods. Biggest gains in LoRA and Adapter Tuning.

Main Contributions:
- First work studying impact of federated fine-tuning on model robustness
- Insights into how heterogeneity affects feature space
- General algorithm GNP to improve robustness by transferring from pre-trained model and adding noise


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper reveals that federated learning risks skewing fine-tuning features and compromising out-of-distribution robustness, and proposes a general noisy projection-based robust algorithm to mitigate this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a general noisy projection-based robust algorithm (GNP) to mitigate the negative impact of federated learning on model robustness. Specifically:

1) The paper first introduces three robustness indicators (Singular Value Entropy, Largest Singular Value Ratio, and Gradient Deviation Angle) and conducts experiments to reveal that federated fine-tuning can skew fine-tuning features and undermine model out-of-distribution robustness. 

2) To improve model robustness, the paper proposes the GNP algorithm which involves deriving a robustness vector from fine-tuned models to transfer robustness from pre-trained model, formulating a value model using robustness indicators to evaluate fine-tuned models, and injecting Gaussian noise to enhance model capacity.

3) Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GNP can markedly enhance model robustness across diverse scenarios, adaptable to various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and different levels of data heterogeneity, without compromising in-distribution accuracy.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the GNP algorithm to improve model out-of-distribution robustness under federated learning, which is shown effective through experiments.
