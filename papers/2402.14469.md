# [Reimagining Anomalies: What If Anomalies Were Normal?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14469)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Reimagining Anomalies: What If Anomalies Were Normal?":

Problem:
- Anomaly detection is an important task with applications across domains like medicine, manufacturing, etc. 
- Deep learning methods have achieved high performance, but lack interpretability. Existing methods like heatmaps highlight anomalous regions but don't explain the higher-level semantics.
- Counterfactual explanations (CEs) can provide a deeper understanding by generating minimally-edited versions of the anomaly that appear normal, but haven't been applied to image anomaly detection.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel unsupervised method to generate counterfactual explanations for image anomaly detectors. 
- A generator is trained to transform anomalies into normal samples by altering them minimally and guided by high-level concepts. This results in multiple CEs for each anomaly, disentangled based on concepts.
- The generator is trained adversarially along with a concept classifier and anomaly score regression to ensure realism, disentanglement of concepts, and normality of the CEs.

Main Contributions:
- First application of counterfactual explanation to interpret image anomaly detectors
- Method to generate multiple disentangled and minimal counterfactual explanations for each anomaly
- The counterfactuals provide semantic explanation of detectors by showing how anomalies can be altered to appear normal
- Extensive experiments over datasets and detectors demonstrate effectiveness both quantitatively and qualitatively
- Reveals classification bias in supervised detectors and provides recourse for improving anomaly coverage
- Overall, enables better understanding of modern anomaly detectors at an unprecedented level of abstraction

In summary, the paper introduces a way to explain image anomaly detectors by generating counterfactual examples that provide high-level semantic insights into the detector's behavior. The method is shown to be effective across detectors and datasets.
