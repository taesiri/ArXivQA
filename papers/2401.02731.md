# [Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Crafting from Dense to Mixture-of-Experts   for Instruction Tuning on General Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02731)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in natural language processing tasks when trained with instruction tuning. However, their performance is limited across multiple tasks due to constrained model capacity. 
- Expanding model capacity during instruction tuning is crucial but poses challenges as most LLMs are dense models with limited scalability. Although sparse Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models allow greater capacity, training them from scratch is computationally prohibitive.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Crafting (PESC), a novel approach to transition dense models into sparse MoE models by reusing weights from the dense models. 
- PESC inserts adapters into the MoE layers of sparse models, enabling differentiation between experts without changing individual expert weights. This significantly reduces computational costs.
- PESC applies the QLoRA technique to update other model weights. The combination allows efficient capacity expansion with minimal parameter increase.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of PESC method for efficient upgrading of model capacity by transitioning dense models into sparse MoE models.
- Implementation of PESC to boost instruction tuning performance across diverse tasks.
- Development of sparse models called Camelidae using PESC that achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source sparse models and demonstrates superior general capabilities over GPT-3.5.

In summary, the paper proposes an innovative PESC technique to transition dense language models into computationally efficient sparse MoE models. By applying PESC during instruction tuning, the resulting Camelidae models establish new benchmarks for open-source sparse models and rival the performance of GPT-3.5 despite using far fewer parameters.
