# [Competitive Facility Location under Random Utilities and Routing   Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04264)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper studies a competitive facility location problem where a company wants to open new facilities in a market with existing competitors. The goal is to choose facility locations to maximize the expected customer demand captured from competitors. Customer choice behavior is modeled using a random utility maximization (RUM) framework, specifically the multinomial logit (MNL) model. 

Unlike prior works that only consider simple constraints like limiting the number of open facilities, this paper introduces complex "routing constraints" requiring the selected locations to form a tour within a specified time budget. This ensures transportation/logistics connectivity among open facilities. The resulting problem combines facility location under RUM with vehicle routing constraints, making it very challenging to solve due to non-linear objectives and NP-hard routing constraints.

To address this, the paper proposes three types of valid inequalities as cuts to iteratively approximate the non-linear objective function and eliminate infeasible routing solutions:

1) Outer-approximation cuts using the concavity of the objective 
2) Submodular cuts using the submodularity property of the objective
3) Sub-tour elimination cuts to remove infeasible tours

These cuts are incorporated into two nested algorithms - Cutting Plane and Branch-and-Cut - where cuts are sequentially added in two loops to converge to an optimal solution. The outer loop adds objective cuts while the inner loop checks routing feasibility. The paper proves the nested cutting plane method always converges in finite iterations.

A local search-based metaheuristic is also proposed to solve large problem instances. Extensive computational experiments on a variety of problem sizes show the nested methods significantly outperform other approaches on small/medium instances. The metaheuristic performs the best on larger instances at the expense of optimality guarantees.

The key contributions are: (i) a new competitive location problem combining facility location under RUM and vehicle routing (ii) nested cutting plane and branch-and-cut algorithms utilizing different cut generations (iii) proof of convergence for the nested cutting plane method (iv) a tailored metaheuristic approach. Both the problem and solution methods are novel to the literature.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper studies a competitive facility location problem with routing constraints where customer demand is modeled using a random utility maximization framework, and proposes new cutting plane and branch-and-cut methods as well as a metaheuristic to efficiently solve this challenging optimization problem.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several key contributions to the competitive facility location problem under random utility maximization models and routing constraints:

1. It proposes three types of valid cuts - outer-approximation cuts, submodular cuts, and sub-tour elimination cuts - to handle the nonlinear objective function and complex routing constraints. These cuts are incorporated into new exact solution methods based on cutting plane and branch-and-cut approaches.

2. It introduces the concept of "valid cuts" that unifies outer-approximation and submodular cuts, and shows that a cutting plane method with valid cuts converges to the optimal solution after a finite number of iterations. This is a generalization of previous convergence results. 

3. It develops a new nested cutting plane (NCP) algorithm that iteratively adds valid cuts and sub-tour elimination cuts in two nested loops. It proves that this method always terminates at an optimal solution after a finite number of iterations.

4. It also proposes a nested branch-and-cut method that works similarly by adding cuts in a nested fashion.

5. It designs a local search-based metaheuristic to effectively solve large-scale problem instances. The method has specific tailoring to address the routing constraints.

6. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed exact and heuristic methods over other baseline approaches in terms of both solution quality and runtime.

In summary, the key contributions are the introduction of specialized cuts, the development of new exact nested algorithms with convergence guarantees, a tailored metaheuristic, and strong empirical performance on benchmark instances.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper develops a Nested Cutting Plane (NCP) algorithm that involves iteratively adding valid cuts and sub-tour elimination cuts to a master problem. Can you explain in detail the logic behind this nested procedure and why it is superior to simply using all cuts in one loop?

2. One key result states that the NCP algorithm always converges to an optimal solution after a finite number of iterations. Walk through the proof of this result and explain the key ideas that establish convergence. 

3. The paper introduces the concept of "valid cuts" that unite both outer-approximation and submodular cuts. Explain what constitutes a valid cut and discuss how this framework generalizes prior convergence results that only considered outer-approximation cuts.

4. The paper develops a Nested Branch-and-Cut (N-B&C) algorithm as an extension of the NCP idea. Discuss the similarities and differences between these two algorithms and when one might be preferred over the other.  

5. The computational experiments vary the number of customer zone groups when adding cuts. Explain the tradeoffs associated with having more or fewer groups and how this impacts overall performance. 

6. The Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic utilizes a Taylor polynomial to approximate the objective function. Discuss the benefits of this approximation and any potential limitations.

7. Compare and contrast the capabilities of the ILS metaheuristic versus the exact NCP and N-B&C methods in solving large problem instances. When might one approach be preferred?

8. The problem formulation uses a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. Discuss the limitations of the MNL in choice modeling and how the use of other advanced choice models might impact the optimization approach.

9. The paper considers a competitive facility location problem with routing constraints. Discuss how the routing constraints impact the properties of the feasible set and complicate the optimization process relative to prior facility location research. 

10. Proposition 1 shows the feasible set in the problem formulation does not constitute a matroid. Explain why the matroid property fails to hold and the implications this has on developing approximation algorithms.
