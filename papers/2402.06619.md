# [Aya Dataset: An Open-Access Collection for Multilingual Instruction   Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06619)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects covered in this paper:

Problem:
- Existing instruction tuning datasets are predominantly focused on English and lack coverage for low-resource languages. This introduces language and cultural biases in models and disadvantages speakers of those languages.
- Prior efforts to extend instruction tuning datasets have relied on machine translation which lacks appropriateness or manual templates with low instructional diversity. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors conduct a year-long participatory research initiative involving 2,997 contributors from 119 countries to develop the Aya Dataset - the largest human-annotated multilingual instruction tuning dataset covering 204K examples in 65 languages. 

- They also develop the Aya Collection consisting of diverse templated and translated instruction-style datasets covering 114 languages and 513M examples. This is the most comprehensive multilingual instruction tuning collection publicly available.

Main Contributions:
- Aya Annotation Platform - An open-sourced UI to facilitate human annotation for instruction tuning in many languages. Used by contributors globally.

- Aya Dataset - Over 204K human-annotated instruction-completion pairs in 65 languages to train multilingual models.

- Aya Collection - An aggregation of 44 templated datasets and 19 translated datasets covering 114 languages and 513M examples.

- Aya Evaluation Suite - A multilingual evaluation benchmark tailored to test open-ended generation covering 101 languages and 25K prompts.

The release of these datasets and the participatory approach establishes a valuable framework for participatory research to advance multilingual AI capabilities.
