# [An Evaluation of GPT-4V and Gemini in Online VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10637)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V and Gemini is critical for assessing their capabilities and progress towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). 
- Existing evaluations have limitations in terms of real-world alignment, ability to evaluate generality, and enable comparison to human performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Use the VQAonline dataset which contains real visual questions from online users, spanning diverse topics and intentions.
- Select a subset of 1,903 questions and generate rich metadata including topics, super-topics, user intentions, required capabilities, knowledge types, image types and difficulty levels.  
- Analyze the zero-shot performance of GPT-4V and Gemini across these metadata categories to thoroughly evaluate strengths, weaknesses and differences.

Key Contributions:
- First evaluation and comparison of GPT-4V and Gemini on an authentic, end-to-end VQA dataset aligned with real-world use cases.
- Comprehensive quantitative analysis across a diverse set of metadata providing granular insights on model capabilities.   
- Identification of challenging areas for both models related to topics (e.g. puzzling), user intentions (e.g. identification), required knowledge (e.g. expert knowledge) and image types (e.g. sheet music).
- Establishes benchmark for state-of-the-art LMMs on authentic VQA data to inform future development.

In summary, the paper undertakes a systematic evaluation of GPT-4V and Gemini on real-world VQA data using rich metadata, uncovering strengths, weaknesses and differences to advance multimodal AI.
