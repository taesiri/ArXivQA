# [A Case for Competent AI Systems $-$ A Concept Note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00052)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- AI systems are becoming increasingly pervasive, yet there are concerns about their potential to cause unintended harm. This is analogous to the "Glass Door Problem" where humans inadvertently injure themselves by not properly perceiving hazards.  

- There is a need to ensure AI systems are "competent" - meaning they not only have the capability to perform tasks, but can do so successfully without errors or accidents. However, competency is not well defined or evaluated in AI systems currently.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper advocates for a "competency-oriented paradigm" when designing, building and deploying AI systems. This involves articulating and reasoning about competency at both the "micro" and "macro" levels.

- Micro-competency looks at individual components and modules within an AI system, including representation, data, algorithms and functionality. Macro-competency examines overall system proficiency for flows, actions and solutions.

- By formally modeling competency and leveraging "competency analytics", deficiencies can be identified through audits and contemplation. The system can then enhance its competency via an improvement feedback loop.

Main Contributions:
- Identifies the critical need to address competency in AI systems to prevent unintended harm, drawing an analogy to human hazards like the "Glass Door Problem".

- Proposes a framework to articulate micro and macro-competency across components and the whole system, spanning representation, data, algorithms and functionality. 

- Advocates using competency analytics and audits to reveal deficiencies, facilitate contemplation by the system, and enable competency enhancement via a feedback improvement loop.

- Overall, argues for elevating competency to a first-class concern when constructing and deploying reliable and safe AI systems. Formal competency articulation and evaluation is seen as key to achieving this.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a framework for articulating and enhancing the competency of AI systems across micro and macro levels to ensure reliable and ethical functionality.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution lies in advocating for a "competency-oriented" paradigm during the design, construction, and deployment of AI systems. Specifically:

The paper proposes elevating competency to first-class status, whether at the micro level within individual modules/components or at the macro level across the entire AI system. It examines the critical components that drive AI system functionality to discern competencies at both the micro and macro levels.

The goal is to enable competency-driven assessments by subjecting the AI system to diverse scenarios over time (contemplation) and employing competency analytics models to computationally evaluate and state/ensure competency. This is aimed at preventing system-induced harm and enhancing the system's competency. 

The paper calls for developing a comprehensive framework and systematic approach to architect and implement a competency-driven, transparent, reliable, and ethical open AI system.

In summary, the main contribution is advocating for making competency a central concern in AI systems, articulating it at multiple levels, and using it to improve system reliability and trustworthiness. This competency-oriented paradigm is posited as a way forward for deploying AI that serves humanity beneficially.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts related to this work include:

- Competency - The paper focuses heavily on the idea of competence or competency in AI systems, referring to what the system is effectively able to accomplish. This distinguishes between capability (what the system is designed for) and actual demonstrated skill.

- Micro-competency - Competency at the level of individual components or modules within the AI system. This includes things like representation competency, data competency, algorithmic competency, and functional competency. 

- Macro-competency - System-level competency that emerges from the interactions between components. This includes flow competency, action competency, and solution competency.

- Glass Door Problem - A metaphor for when deficiencies in competency lead an AI system into unintended failures or accidents, akin to a person distractedly walking into a glass door.

- Moral competency - The ability of an AI system to achieve intended goals without causing unintended harm, which could stem from gaps in competency.

- Contemplation - The process of an AI system iteratively assessing and enhancing its own competency over time through reflective processes and auditing. 

- Competency analytics - Evaluation methods and models to quantify and specify competency at both the system and component levels.

- Computational competency - Competency modeling and articulation using computational frameworks and formal methods.

The paper focuses heavily on explicating system competency as a key priority in order to boost reliability and address ethical implications of real-world AI deployments.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a framework for articulating the competency of AI systems. What are the key components of this framework and how do they relate to assessing the micro-competency and macro-competency of an AI system?

2. The paper introduces the concept of the "Glass Door Problem." Explain this concept in detail and discuss how it relates to deficiencies in an AI system's competency. What are some examples that illustrate this problem? 

3. The paper advocates for a "competency-oriented paradigm" during the design, construction, and deployment of AI systems. What does this entail and why is it argued to be important? Discuss the implications.

4. Explain the inside-out and outside-in paradigms for formulating and computing micro-competency and macro-competency of an AI system. What are the relative advantages and limitations of each approach? 

5. What is representation competency and why is it considered pivotal for an AI system? Discuss the factors that influence representation competency and how it impacts other aspects of system competency.

6. The paper argues computational competency is an emerging and promising research domain. What are some of the models, methods, and procedures that could contribute to computational competency and competency analytics?

7. Discuss the relationship between system specifications and system competency. What is the key distinction between these two concepts in the context of AI systems?

8. The concept of fragility in AI systems is noted to be interrelated with competency. Explain this connection and discuss how fragility metrics could potentially be used to quantify competency. 

9. Outline some strategies proposed in the paper for enhancing the competency of an AI system over time. How could competency analytics and audit trails facilitate these enhancement processes? 

10. The paper proposes the idea of requiring AI systems to undergo thorough competency evaluations under diverse scenarios prior to deployment, akin to clinical trials. Discuss the feasibility and potential limitations of such an approach.
