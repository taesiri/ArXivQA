# [FTBC: Forward Temporal Bias Correction for Optimizing ANN-SNN Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18388)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Converting pre-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) is a popular approach for training SNNs. However, this conversion process introduces errors such as unevenness error stemming from variability in input spike sequences over time. Existing methods have not effectively addressed this temporal unevenness error.   

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new conversion approach called Forward Temporal Bias Correction (FTBC) that reduces unevenness error by correcting biases over time. The key ideas are:

1) Introduce time-dependent channel-wise biases $b_t$ that are calibrated at each timestep based on the difference between ANN activations and SNN outputs at that timestep. This aligns SNN outputs with ANN activations dynamically over time.

2) Provide theoretical analysis showing expected SNN output can match expected ANN output through temporal bias calibration. Also give practical algorithm to calculate biases only in forward pass, avoiding extra computations.

3) Apply FTBC layer-wise at each timestep to maintain temporal precision and fidelity of spike dynamics. Distribute adjustments across timesteps rather than averaging over timesteps.


Main Contributions:

1) Propose Forward Temporal Bias Correction (FTBC) to reduce unevenness error in ANN-SNN conversion by correcting bias over time.

2) Provide theoretical foundation showing expected conversion error can be reduced to 0 through temporal bias calibration. Give efficient forward-pass algorithm.  

3) Show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets. FTBC gives 3-5% and 10-15% higher accuracy on CIFAR and ImageNet respectively.

4) Demonstrate versatility of FTBC by integrating it with other conversion methods like QCFS and RTS to further boost performance over multiple datasets and architectures.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in ANN-SNN conversion by accounting for temporal dynamics through forward temporal bias corrections to enhance conversion accuracy and efficiency.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a lightweight Forward Temporal Bias Correction (FTBC) technique for ANN-SNN conversion that reduces unevenness error and improves conversion accuracy by dynamically calibrating channel-wise bias terms based on the temporal activation patterns from the ANN, validated through CIFAR and ImageNet experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The introduction of the Forward Temporal Bias Correction (\method), an approach in ANN-SNN conversion that effectively addresses temporal bias, enhancing the accuracy of SNNs at each time step throughout the simulation time.

2. Providing a theoretical foundation of the proposed method, showing that through temporal bias calibration, the expected error of ANN-SNN conversion can be reduced to zero. The paper also provides a heuristic algorithm for finding temporal biases only in the forward pass.

3. Extensive experimental validation showing that the proposed method surpasses existing conversion methods in terms of accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a lightweight yet effective temporal bias calibration technique called Forward Temporal Bias Correction to improve the accuracy of converted SNNs by reducing the unevenness error during ANN-SNN conversion. Both theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this method.
