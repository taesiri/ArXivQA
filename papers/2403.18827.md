# [Bridging Generative Networks with the Common Model of Cognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18827)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
There is currently no consensus on how to effectively integrate symbolic, rule-based AI (GOFAI) with modern statistical approaches like deep learning. One less explored method is integrating generative AI models like large language models into cognitive architectures that aim to model human cognition, like the Common Model of Cognition (CMC). However, the CMC currently lacks a way to make the outputs of neural networks interpretable at the cognitive level.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose several significant adjustments to the CMC to allow it to incorporate and interpret the outputs of large generative neural networks:

1) Add an interface layer called "Middle Memory" (MM) between the CMC modules and the neural networks. MM receives vector representations from the networks and assigns activations to make some outputs more likely to reach working memory.

2) Model all CMC modules except procedural and working memory as "shadow production systems" - sets of if-then rules that operate in parallel to interface between networks and central production system. 

3) On each cycle, combine working memory contents with active MM vectors to form inputs for the generative networks. This allows the networks to anticipate what outputs will be useful.

4) Use the same temporal difference learning rule to update utilities of central and shadow productions, allowing the entire system to learn as a whole.

Main Contributions:
- A novel method to incorporate and interpret the outputs of large generative neural networks within the modular structure of the CMC
- The concept of "shadow production systems" as a standardized way to implement peripheral modules in cognitive architectures
- A system that combines predictive statistical learning with higher level symbolic reasoning and metacognition, allowing it to model a broader range of human cognitive capacities.

The proposed adjustments provide both a theoretical framework and practical path to unite cognitive architectures and deep learning. This could allow for AI systems with more robust reasoning abilities.
