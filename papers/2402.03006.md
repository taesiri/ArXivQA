# [On the development of a practical Bayesian optimisation algorithm for   expensive experiments and simulations with changing environmental conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Many optimization problems in engineering involve experiments or simulations where some parameters cannot be controlled and vary based on environmental conditions. Traditional Bayesian optimization methods assume all parameters can be set to any desired values. The paper aims to extend Bayesian optimization to handle problems with both controllable and uncontrollable parameters.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an extension to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to allow optimization with changing environmental conditions (uncontrollable parameters). The key ideas are:

1) Fit a global surrogate model using a Gaussian process over all parameters, both controllable and uncontrollable. 

2) When selecting the next point to evaluate, first measure the values of the uncontrollable parameters. Then solve the acquisition function to find the optimal values of the controllable parameters conditioned on the measured uncontrollable values.

3) Use only a single randomly sampled data point to initialize the algorithm instead of multiple points from a space-filling design.

Main Contributions:

- Presentation of a practical Bayesian optimization algorithm capable of optimization problems with both controllable and uncontrollable parameters that vary randomly.

- Empirical analysis of the proposed algorithm on test functions, evaluating effects of noise, number of uncontrollable parameters, parameter fluctuation and variability, and domain size.

- Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm (ENVBO) in optimizing wind turbine positions in a wind farm simulator with randomly varying wind direction. ENVBO finds better solutions using fewer function evaluations than standard Bayesian optimization and sequential quadratic programming approaches.

- Introduction of an open source implementation of ENVBO made available in the NUBO Python package that allows applying this method to other problems.

Overall, the paper makes Bayesian optimization more applicable to real-world engineering problems where environmental conditions cannot be controlled. The proposed algorithm is shown to be more sample-efficient and cost-effective compared to existing methods.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper extends Bayesian optimization to optimize expensive experiments and simulations with uncontrollable environmental variables by fitting a global surrogate model over all variables and conditioning the acquisition function optimization on measurements of the environmental variables.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an extension to the Bayesian optimization algorithm that allows the optimization of problems with uncontrollable environmental variables. Specifically:

- It fits a global surrogate model over all controllable parameters and environmental variables. This allows sharing of information between different values of the environmental variables.

- It solves the acquisition function used to select new candidate points conditionally on measured values of the environmental variables. This allows optimizing the controllable parameters for any given values of the uncontrollable variables. 

- It requires only a single initial data point instead of multiple points from a space-filling design. This is necessary since arbitrary combinations of variables can't be set with uncontrollable variables.

The proposed ENVBO algorithm is shown to be more sample-efficient and cost-effective compared to regular Bayesian optimization and other methods when optimizing problems with changing environmental conditions. It is able to optimize over the full range of the environmental variables in one run rather than having to repeat the optimization for many fixed values.

The paper presents an extension to Bayesian optimisation to allow optimisation problems with uncontrollable "environmental" variables, such as temperature or wind conditions. It uses concepts like Gaussian processes, acquisition functions, surrogate modelling, etc. to develop a conditional optimisation approach. The method is applied to optimise wind turbine positions in a wind farm simulator with changing wind directions. Key outcomes are improved performance and sample efficiency compared to benchmarks.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes fitting a global surrogate model over all controllable and uncontrollable variables. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to fitting separate models? How does it affect the flexibility and complexity of the model?

2. The acquisition function is maximized conditionally on measured values of the uncontrollable variables. How does this constrain or change the effective search space at each iteration? Could it lead to a suboptimal conditional optimum?  

3. Only one initial training point is used rather than a space-filling design with multiple points. What effect might this have on the quality of the early iterations? Could it increase dependence on the prior?

4. The method is shown to work well with noisy observations. What properties of Gaussian processes might explain their robustness to noise in this context? How might the noise levels affect uncertainty estimates?

5. More uncontrollable variables are shown to increase error and uncertainty. Is this an inherent limitation or could it be mitigated by modifying the approach? What changes would be needed?

6. Higher fluctuation in uncontrollable variables requires more evaluations. Is there a theoretical basis for determining the relationship between fluctuations and required evaluations? How might you determine an adequate evaluation budget?

7. The effective domain size correlates with error. Is domain coverage the key factor? Could the relationship be better characterized? Are there domain properties aside from raw size that matter? 

8. How does the conditional optimization approach compare theoretically to methods that integrate out uncontrollable variables or find one solution over their distribution? What are limitations and advantages?

9. The wind farm application shows strong performance improvements over benchmarks. What aspects of the problem might make it well suited for this method? Would all optimization problems with uncontrollables benefit?

10. The paper focuses on expected improvement as the acquisition function. How might the choice of acquisition function interact with the uncontrollable variables? Could other acquisitions like UCB perform differently?
