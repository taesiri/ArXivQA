# [On the development of a practical Bayesian optimisation algorithm for   expensive experiments and simulations with changing environmental conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03006)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Many optimization problems in engineering involve experiments or simulations where some parameters cannot be controlled and vary based on environmental conditions. Traditional Bayesian optimization methods assume all parameters can be set to any desired values. The paper aims to extend Bayesian optimization to handle problems with both controllable and uncontrollable parameters.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an extension to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to allow optimization with changing environmental conditions (uncontrollable parameters). The key ideas are:

1) Fit a global surrogate model using a Gaussian process over all parameters, both controllable and uncontrollable. 

2) When selecting the next point to evaluate, first measure the values of the uncontrollable parameters. Then solve the acquisition function to find the optimal values of the controllable parameters conditioned on the measured uncontrollable values.

3) Use only a single randomly sampled data point to initialize the algorithm instead of multiple points from a space-filling design.

Main Contributions:

- Presentation of a practical Bayesian optimization algorithm capable of optimization problems with both controllable and uncontrollable parameters that vary randomly.

- Empirical analysis of the proposed algorithm on test functions, evaluating effects of noise, number of uncontrollable parameters, parameter fluctuation and variability, and domain size.

- Demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm (ENVBO) in optimizing wind turbine positions in a wind farm simulator with randomly varying wind direction. ENVBO finds better solutions using fewer function evaluations than standard Bayesian optimization and sequential quadratic programming approaches.

- Introduction of an open source implementation of ENVBO made available in the NUBO Python package that allows applying this method to other problems.

Overall, the paper makes Bayesian optimization more applicable to real-world engineering problems where environmental conditions cannot be controlled. The proposed algorithm is shown to be more sample-efficient and cost-effective compared to existing methods.
