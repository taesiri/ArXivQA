# [Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Decoupling for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04483)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summarized paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new diffusion model-based approach called HiGen for high-quality text-to-video generation. The key idea is to hierarchically decouple the spatial and temporal aspects of videos at both the model structure level and content level. At the structure level, HiGen decomposes text-to-video generation into separate spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning steps using a unified model, enabling it to leverage powerful image generation capabilities. For content-level decoupling, HiGen extracts motion and appearance cues from the video content to guide the model's training, allowing flexible control over spatial and temporal variations. Through this hierarchical spatio-temporal decoupling approach, HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of video generation while achieving superior performance - generating videos with accurate semantics, photorealistic quality, temporal continuity and motion diversity. Experiments demonstrate HiGen's state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing diffusion-based video generation methods on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The proposed hierarchical paradigm offers an effective way to disentangle the intricate spatial and temporal entanglements in video data.
