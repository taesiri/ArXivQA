# [Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Decoupling for Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04483)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summarized paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new diffusion model-based approach called HiGen for high-quality text-to-video generation. The key idea is to hierarchically decouple the spatial and temporal aspects of videos at both the model structure level and content level. At the structure level, HiGen decomposes text-to-video generation into separate spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning steps using a unified model, enabling it to leverage powerful image generation capabilities. For content-level decoupling, HiGen extracts motion and appearance cues from the video content to guide the model's training, allowing flexible control over spatial and temporal variations. Through this hierarchical spatio-temporal decoupling approach, HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of video generation while achieving superior performance - generating videos with accurate semantics, photorealistic quality, temporal continuity and motion diversity. Experiments demonstrate HiGen's state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing diffusion-based video generation methods on both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The proposed hierarchical paradigm offers an effective way to disentangle the intricate spatial and temporal entanglements in video data.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a diffusion model-based text-to-video generation method called HiGen that hierarchically decouples the spatial and temporal factors of videos at both the structure level, by separating spatial and temporal reasoning, and at the content level, by extracting motion and appearance cues, in order to reduce complexity and generate more realistic and diverse videos.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a hierarchical spatio-temporal decoupling approach for text-to-video generation using diffusion models. Specifically:

1) At the structure level, it decomposes the text-to-video task into separate spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning processes using a unified denoiser model. Spatial reasoning focuses on generating spatially coherent priors from text, while temporal reasoning generates temporally coherent motions from these priors. 

2) At the content level, it extracts two cues - a motion factor and an appearance factor - that represent motion changes and appearance changes in videos respectively. These cues are used as guidance to enhance the stability and diversity of generated videos during training.

Through this hierarchical decoupling of spatial and temporal factors at both the model structure level and video content level, the method reduces the complexity of text-to-video generation and is able to produce high-quality videos with accurate semantics and motion stability. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

The key ideas include decomposing the task into spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning stages, extracting motion and appearance cues to guide the model training, and using a unified denoiser model for both steps.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Generating realistic and diverse videos from text descriptions remains challenging for current text-to-video (T2V) generation methods. Existing approaches typically entangle the complex spatial and temporal aspects of videos together, making it difficult to achieve good performance on both spatial quality and temporal dynamics. 

Proposed Solution - HiGen:
The paper proposes a new diffusion model-based approach called HiGen that hierarchically decouples the spatial and temporal factors of videos to reduce complexity. Specifically:

1) Structure-Level Decoupling: The T2V task is decomposed into spatial reasoning to generate high-quality spatial priors from text, and temporal reasoning to produce coherent motions by taking the spatial priors as input. This leverages powerful text-to-image models to ensure spatial quality. 

2) Content-Level Decoupling: Two subtle cues are extracted to represent motion changes and appearance changes in the videos separately. These cues provide guidance to the model during training to enable better control over spatial-temporal variations.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a hierarchical spatio-temporal decoupling paradigm to reduce complexity for T2V generation using diffusion models.
- Achieves significantly improved spatial quality and temporal dynamics over state-of-the-art T2V methods. 
- Enables flexible control over motion and appearance factors during inference to generate more vivid and stable videos.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, with superior quantitative and qualitative performance.

In summary, by decoupling the intricate spatial and temporal factors in videos, HiGen generates high-fidelity and dynamic videos from text in a more controllable manner.
