# [United We Pretrain, Divided We Fail! Representation Learning for Time   Series by Pretraining on 75 Datasets at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15404)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- In NLP and computer vision, pretraining on large unlabeled datasets has led to great success by learning effective general representations. However, this has not transferred well to time series data due to potential mismatch between sources and targets. 
- Common belief is that multi-dataset pretraining does not work for time series.
- Most time series classification systems are purely supervised and rely on expensive complete labels per dataset. This is problematic given the lack of labels and scarcity of sufficient data points in many real-world situations like healthcare.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces a new self-supervised contrastive pretraining approach to learn a single encoding from many diverse unlabeled time series datasets.
- This representation can then be reused in several downstream target domains for classification without requiring extensive retraining.

Key Contributions:
1. Show how up to 75 unlabeled time series datasets can be combined effectively into a single pretraining collection.
2. Propose a novel interpolation method called Cross-Dataset MixUp (XD-MixUp) that induces a shared latent representation across datasets.
3. Propose a new Soft Interpolation Contextual Contrasting (SICC) loss function, which is combined with the existing Time Series Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC) framework using XD-MixUp into an architecture called XIT.
4. Demonstrate good transfer classification performance on multiple small labeled target datasets, outperforming both supervised training and other self-supervised pretraining methods, especially in low-data regimes. This disproves the common belief that multi-dataset pretraining does not work for time series.

In summary, the paper introduces a new pretraining methodology XIT that combines multiple innovations to effectively learn from diverse unlabeled time series data. It shows strong empirical evidence that this representation transfers well to downstream tasks, constituting an important step forward for time series representation learning.
