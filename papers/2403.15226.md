# [Not All Attention is Needed: Parameter and Computation Efficient   Transfer Learning for Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15226)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have high computational complexity due to the introduction of visual modalities, making their tuning to downstream tasks parameter and computationally expensive. 
- Existing methods like adapters add latency during inference which limits efficiency.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS) to reduce both parameters and computation for tuning MLLMs.
- EAS evaluates and skips redundant multi-head attentions (MHAs), which are less important than feedforward networks (FFNs) for retaining performance.
- A novel Propagation-of-Information Adapter (PIA) is proposed to replace skipped MHAs. PIA exchanges information like MHAs and has no latency as it is reparameterized into FFNs after training.

Main Contributions:
- EAS reduces both parameters and computation for tuning MLLMs by selectively skipping redundant MHAs using PIA.
- PIA exchanges information during training and is reparameterized into FFNs to avoid latency during inference.
- Experiments on LaVIN model and ScienceQA dataset show EAS retains performance while speeding up inference by 2.2x compared to default LaVIN and 1.9x over a strong baseline.
- Experiments on METER model show EAS matches performance of state-of-the-art while reducing computations significantly.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient attention skipping method to reduce parameters and computation for tuning large multi-modal models using a novel propagate-information adapter, providing up to 2x speedups without performance loss.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an efficient attention skipping method to reduce both parameters and computation for multi-modal large language models by evaluating and replacing redundant multi-head attentions using a novel propagation-of-information adapter.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a novel method called Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS) for parameter and computation efficient tuning of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). The main contributions are:

1) EAS reveals that not all multi-head attentions (MHAs) are needed for efficient adaptation of MLLMs to downstream tasks. It evaluates and skips redundant MHAs to improve efficiency.

2) A new Propagation-of-Information Adapter (PIA) is proposed to serve the MHA skipping without incurring additional latency. PIA can propagate averaged features for information exchange like MHA, and gets re-parameterized into feedforward networks. 

3) Extensive experiments applying EAS to models like LaVIN and METER show its effectiveness - EAS retains high performance and parameter efficiency while speeding up inference, e.g. improving LaVIN's inference speed by 2.2x on ScienceQA.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing the EAS method to achieve parameter and computation efficient tuning of MLLMs via efficient attention skipping and a specially designed adapter.

The paper proposes a novel method called "efficient attention skipping" (EAS) to achieve parameter and computation efficient tuning of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). It uses a propagation-of-information adapter (PIA) to enable attention skipping without additional latency. The goal is to remove redundant components in MLLMs to improve efficiency on downstream vision-language tasks while retaining high performance. Key aspects include evaluating attention redundancy, skipping less important multi-head attentions (MHAs), replacing them with PIAs, and re-parameterizing the PIAs into feedforward networks. Experiments on LaVIN and ScienceQA showcase the effectiveness.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the motivation behind proposing Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS) for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)? Why is it argued that not all attention is needed for efficient tuning of MLLMs?

2. How does EAS evaluate the redundancy of multi-head attention (MHA) modules in MLLMs? Explain the reinforcement learning based approach in detail. 

3. What are the limitations of using adapters for skip connections in methods like Dynamic Architecture Skipping (DAS)? How does the proposed Propagation-of-Information Adapter (PIA) overcome these limitations?

4. Explain the working of PIA in detail. How does the multi-path design enable information exchange while being parameter efficient? 

5. How is PIA re-parameterized into feedforward networks (FFNs) for zero extra latency during inference? Explain the process of obtaining merged projection matrices.  

6. On what basis is it argued that feedforward networks (FFNs) store more pre-training knowledge compared to MHAs? What do the ablation studies reveal in this regard?

7. How does EAS achieve better efficiency compared to only skipping entire Transformer layers as in DAS? What granularity does EAS operate at and why?

8. What are the quantitative improvements achieved by EAS in terms of performance, parameter efficiency and inference speed over methods like LaVIN and DAS?

9. How suitable is the PIA design for working with different types of MLLM inputs like language-only or language-vision data? 

10. What is a potential direction to further improve upon EAS, such as combining it with model compression techniques?
