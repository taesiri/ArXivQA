# [3DAxiesPrompts: Unleashing the 3D Spatial Task Capabilities of GPT-4V](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09738)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- GPT-4v shows proficiency in understanding 2D images but has limitations in comprehending 3D spatial relationships and tasks. 
- Prior visual prompting techniques for GPT-4v focus on 2D images and have not explored unleashing its 3D capabilities.

Proposed Solution: 
- The authors propose a new visual prompting method called 3D Axes Prompts (3DAP) to enhance GPT-4v's 3D spatial understanding.
- 3DAP involves overlaying a 3D coordinate system and scale information onto 3D images as visual prompts. 
- The 3D coordinate system acts as a spatial framework to describe object positions and interrelations. The scale information enables precise localization.

Key Contributions:
- A new visual prompting method 3DAP that marks 3D coordinate axes and scale information on input images. Experiments show 3DAP unlocks GPT-4v's potential for 3D tasks.
- Identified 3 tasks that can be reliably achieved using 3DAP: 2D to 3D point reconstruction, 2D to 3D point matching, and 3D object detection. 
- Constructed a small 3D visual prompting dataset called 3DAP-Data focusing on objects with distinct verticals/planes to evaluate 3DAP.

In experiments, GPT-4v with 3DAP inputs demonstrated significantly improved performance on the 3 tasks compared to without 3DAP. Ablation studies validated the importance of both coordinate system and scale markings in 3DAP prompting. Overall, the proposed 3DAP method and experiments effectively showcase enhanced 3D spatial understanding capabilities of GPT-4v.
