# [Classification of Human- and AI-Generated Texts for English, French,   German, and Spanish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04882)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

In this paper, the authors investigate features to classify texts as human-written, AI-generated from scratch, or AI-rephrased across four languages - English, French, German, and Spanish. They created a multilingual corpus covering 10 topics in each language to train and test classifiers using the proposed features. For AI-generated text detection, combining all features works best across languages, achieving F1 scores of 98-99%, indicating the features are portable across related languages. However, for AI-rephrased text detection, results vary more - using all features works best for French (F1 87.9%) and Spanish (F1 82.9%), but document features alone perform best for German (F1 71.9%) and text vector features for English (F1 78.2%). The classifiers significantly outperform existing AI detection tools like ZeroGPT. The authors conclude the same feature set could be applied to other languages in the same families. Future work involves expanding the language families assessed, topics covered, and testing transformer architectures.
