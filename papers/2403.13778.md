# [Certified Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from this research paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and noise from real-world imperfect input data. Several heuristic defenses have been proposed but they lack guaranteed robustness. 

- Traditional accuracy metrics like ADE/FDE are unreliable because they don't consider potential input noises. There is a need for certified metrics that account for input perturbations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using randomized smoothing to provide certified robustness guarantees for trajectory prediction. This involves adding random noise to inputs, feeding them through a denoiser and trajectory predictor, and aggregating the outputs.

- They investigate using both mean and median aggregators, with median being better suited for the trajectory prediction task. To deal with unbounded outputs, they employ an adaptive clamping strategy.

- For multi-modal prediction models, they certify the best sample among multiple outputs. They also integrate a Wiener filter based denoiser into the pipeline to further tighten certified bounds.

Contributions:
- First application of randomized smoothing certification to trajectory prediction models, tailored to handle unique aspects like unbounded & multi-modal outputs.

- Introduction of new metrics like Certified-ADE/FDE and Certified-Collision rate that provide guaranteed performance bounds under input noise.

- Comprehensive experiments that derive certified bounds for state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark dataset. Trade-off analysis between accuracy and robustness.

- Demonstration of smoothed model's robustness against adversarial attacks and real-world noise, unlike original models. Impact of denoising on bound tightening also analyzed.

Overall, the paper presents an important advancement towards building reliable trajectory prediction systems using certification techniques. The proposed certified smoothing approach guarantees robustness bounds while maintaining accuracy.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a certified trajectory prediction model that provides guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy inputs. Specifically:

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using randomized smoothing for trajectory prediction models. How does this approach provide certified robustness compared to other verification methods like abstract interpretation or SMT solvers? What are the tradeoffs?

2. The paper discusses two aggregation functions for randomized smoothing - mean and median. Why is median aggregation more suitable for the trajectory prediction task compared to mean aggregation? What characteristics of the trajectory prediction problem lead to this?

3. Adaptive clamping is proposed to provide output bounds for mean smoothing. What challenges arise in posing output bounds for trajectory prediction and how does adaptive clamping address this? How sensitive are the final certified bounds to the estimated min/max values?

4. For multi-modal trajectory predictors, certification is provided for the best sample. How does the presence of multiple modes impact the certified bounds compared to a single-modal predictor? What changes need to be made to the certification approach to make it fully compatible with multi-modality?

5. How does the introduction of the denoiser improve certified bounds? Theoretically analyze how signal denoising prior to the predictor affects the output distributions and certified radii.

6. The paper analyzes robustness against imperfect real-world observations from an upstream detection/tracking module. How do the different types and amounts of noise from these modules impact certified bounds?

7. What modifications need to be made to provide certification for multi-agent interactions instead of perturbations to a single agent? How do inter-dependencies between agents affect certified bounds?

8. Theoretical analysis: Provide finite sample generalization bounds for the certified robustness properties of the proposed approach using tools from statistical learning theory. 

9. The computational analysis shows real-time performance on a high-end GPU. Provide approximate run-time expressions in terms of key parameters like sequence length, Monte Carlo samples, model complexity etc.

10. Suggest extensions to the current framework - (a) certifying waypoint or goal predictions (b) combining randomized smoothing with Bayesian neural nets or ensembles. Analyze the feasibility and expected outcomes.
