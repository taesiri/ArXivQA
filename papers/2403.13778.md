# [Certified Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13778)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from this research paper:

Problem:
- Trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and noise from real-world imperfect input data. Several heuristic defenses have been proposed but they lack guaranteed robustness. 

- Traditional accuracy metrics like ADE/FDE are unreliable because they don't consider potential input noises. There is a need for certified metrics that account for input perturbations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose using randomized smoothing to provide certified robustness guarantees for trajectory prediction. This involves adding random noise to inputs, feeding them through a denoiser and trajectory predictor, and aggregating the outputs.

- They investigate using both mean and median aggregators, with median being better suited for the trajectory prediction task. To deal with unbounded outputs, they employ an adaptive clamping strategy.

- For multi-modal prediction models, they certify the best sample among multiple outputs. They also integrate a Wiener filter based denoiser into the pipeline to further tighten certified bounds.

Contributions:
- First application of randomized smoothing certification to trajectory prediction models, tailored to handle unique aspects like unbounded & multi-modal outputs.

- Introduction of new metrics like Certified-ADE/FDE and Certified-Collision rate that provide guaranteed performance bounds under input noise.

- Comprehensive experiments that derive certified bounds for state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark dataset. Trade-off analysis between accuracy and robustness.

- Demonstration of smoothed model's robustness against adversarial attacks and real-world noise, unlike original models. Impact of denoising on bound tightening also analyzed.

Overall, the paper presents an important advancement towards building reliable trajectory prediction systems using certification techniques. The proposed certified smoothing approach guarantees robustness bounds while maintaining accuracy.
