# [Partial Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01615)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) trains models on decentralized edge devices to address privacy concerns with sending data to a central server. However, existing FL approaches make the restrictive assumption that all data modalities face uniform privacy constraints. 
- In practice, some modalities may have fewer restrictions allowing them to be shared with the server, while other more sensitive modalities need to be kept locally. Existing learning paradigms do not efficiently support this case of distributed data modalities.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes "Partial Federated Learning" (PartialFL), where a subset of less restricted data modalities and their intermediate representations are shared with the central server. More sensitive modalities remain localized on edge devices.
- Additional local encoders and contrastive learning objectives are introduced to improve model robustness and address data heterogeneity compared to typical FL.
- The framework has 3 components: 1) Server model trained on shareable data, 2) Global model trained via federated optimization on non-shareable data, 3) Local models trained on edge devices.

Main Contributions:
- Presents a new federated learning algorithm for the case of distributed data modalities with differing privacy constraints. Enables flexibility compared to traditional FL assumptions.
- Evaluates PartialFL on speech emotion and image classification tasks. Shows improved performance over federated averaging and federated proximal baselines.
- Demonstrates robustness to non-IID data distributions and missing modalities on some edge devices. Approaches centralized upper performance limits without heavy communication costs.

In summary, the key idea is to efficiently utilize shareable modalities on a central server to improve model quality compared to fully localized federated learning. The method is flexible to real-world cases where privacy constraints differ across data modalities.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a new federated learning algorithm called Partial Federated Learning (PartialFL) to train machine learning models when data modalities are split between edge devices and a central server, with experimental results demonstrating improved performance over traditional federated learning approaches.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Presenting a new Federated Learning algorithm called Partial Federated Learning (PartialFL) to train a machine learning model when data modalities are split among different devices.

2. Evaluating the PartialFL algorithm on two different data sets and presenting key results showing improvements in model performance compared to baselines like centralized learning, split learning, and typical federated learning.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing the PartialFL algorithm for federated learning with distributed data modalities and demonstrating its improved performance over other approaches. The key idea is to have a shared modality between the server and edge devices to train more robust representations, while keeping private modalities only on the devices.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Partial Federated Learning (PartialFL) - The main algorithm proposed in the paper for training machine learning models with distributed data modalities. Allows sharing of some modalities with a server while keeping others localized.

- Multi-modal learning - The paper focuses on settings with multiple data modalities (e.g. audio, text, images) and using them jointly for model training.

- Privacy preservation - A goal of the proposed approach is to enable model training while preserving privacy by not sharing raw user data or labels with the server.

- Contrastive learning - Used as an objective for aligning representations across modalities and devices without needing labels at the server.

- Speech emotion recognition (SER) - One of the main experimental task domains, using multi-modal speech data to classify emotions.

- Knowledge distillation - Used across models on different devices to improve robustness.

- Data heterogeneity - The non-IID data distribution in federated learning which PartialFL aims to address.

- Vertical federated learning - Related paradigm where features for the same samples are split across devices.

So in summary - partial federated learning, multi-modal learning, privacy preservation, contrastive learning objectives, speech emotion recognition experiments are some of the central keywords.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I generated about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using a contrastive loss to align the textual embeddings generated on the edge devices and server. Can you explain in more detail how this contrastive loss is constructed? What are the positive and negative pairs?

2. When training the global model, a cross-modal contrastive loss is used between the audio/image embeddings and textual embeddings. What is the intuition behind adding this additional loss term instead of just using the standard classification loss?  

3. The local model on the edge devices includes a classifier module. Why can the full local model not be shared with the server? What implications would this have on privacy?

4. How exactly is the training process coordinated between the server model and edge device models? Explain the details of the alternating minimization algorithm used.

5. What are some key differences between the proposed approach and existing paradigms like Federated Learning, Split Learning, and Federated Group Knowledge Transfer? What advantages does Partial Federated Learning provide?

6. One component of PartialFL is training larger models on the server using the shared modality. How does this help address the data heterogeneity issue prevalent in Federated Learning?

7. What strategies does this approach use to protect privacy when sharing representations of certain modalities with the server? Are there still potential privacy risks?

8. How robust is PartialFL when some edge devices are missing the shareable modality? Explain what your ablation experiments revealed in this aspect.  

9. What was the motivation behind evaluating PartialFL on speech emotion recognition tasks? What kinds of real-world applications can you foresee this being useful for?

10. The temperature parameter tau seems to have minimal impact on PartialFL performance in your experiments. Intuitively, why might this be the case? What properties of PartialFL contribute to its robustness to this hyperparameter?
