# [Towards Measuring the Representation of Subjective Global Opinions in   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a quantitative framework to evaluate whose opinions (across different countries) large language model-generated responses are more similar to?The key goals of the paper appear to be:1) To build a dataset and metric that can measure the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and actual human responses from different countries. 2) To then use this methodology to analyze potential biases in a large language model by testing how responses shift when conditioning the model on a country prompt or translating the prompt into different languages.3) To increase transparency into whose perspectives and opinions LLMs may be preferentially representing by default versus when provided additional context cues. The overarching hypothesis seems to be that LLMs may disproportionately represent the opinions and viewpoints of certain groups more than others by default. The experiments then aim to test this by quantifying which countries' opinions the LLM responses are most similar to under different prompting conditions.In summary, the core research question is focused on developing a novel quantitative framework for evaluating whose opinions and perspectives LLMs align with, and using this methodology to assess potential biases in how different groups' views are represented. The key hypothesis is that LLMs may over-represent certain opinions more than others.
