# [Towards Measuring the Representation of Subjective Global Opinions in   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a quantitative framework to evaluate whose opinions (across different countries) large language model-generated responses are more similar to?The key goals of the paper appear to be:1) To build a dataset and metric that can measure the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and actual human responses from different countries. 2) To then use this methodology to analyze potential biases in a large language model by testing how responses shift when conditioning the model on a country prompt or translating the prompt into different languages.3) To increase transparency into whose perspectives and opinions LLMs may be preferentially representing by default versus when provided additional context cues. The overarching hypothesis seems to be that LLMs may disproportionately represent the opinions and viewpoints of certain groups more than others by default. The experiments then aim to test this by quantifying which countries' opinions the LLM responses are most similar to under different prompting conditions.In summary, the core research question is focused on developing a novel quantitative framework for evaluating whose opinions and perspectives LLMs align with, and using this methodology to assess potential biases in how different groups' views are represented. The key hypothesis is that LLMs may over-represent certain opinions more than others.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be:The development of a quantitative framework and dataset to evaluate how well large language models represent diverse global opinions and perspectives. The key elements of this contribution are:1) Compiling a new dataset called GlobalOpinionQA from established cross-national surveys (Pew Global Attitudes and World Values Survey). This provides a set of questions and human responses capturing opinions on societal issues across many different countries. 2) Defining a metric to quantify the similarity between a language model's responses to the survey questions and the actual human responses grouped by country. This allows measuring which human perspectives and opinions the model aligns with most closely.3) Applying this evaluation framework to test a large language model trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback and Constitutional AI. The experiments reveal biases in the model's default responses toward Western countries' opinions. Prompting the model from other countries' perspectives shifts responses but can reflect harmful stereotypes. 4) Releasing the dataset and an interactive visualization to support further research on evaluating representation of diverse global opinions in language models.In summary, the core contribution is creating a novel methodology and dataset to quantitatively assess whose opinions and perspectives language models align with. This sheds light on biases and could guide work toward more equitable AI systems. The release of the data and visualizations also enables future research in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper develops a framework to evaluate how similar large language model responses are to human survey responses on subjective questions across countries, finding the models' default responses tend to align more with Western viewpoints but prompts can steer responses towards different cultural perspectives, albeit sometimes in simplistic or stereotypical ways.
