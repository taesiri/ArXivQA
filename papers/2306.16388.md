# [Towards Measuring the Representation of Subjective Global Opinions in   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16388)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we develop a quantitative framework to evaluate whose opinions (across different countries) large language model-generated responses are more similar to?The key goals of the paper appear to be:1) To build a dataset and metric that can measure the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and actual human responses from different countries. 2) To then use this methodology to analyze potential biases in a large language model by testing how responses shift when conditioning the model on a country prompt or translating the prompt into different languages.3) To increase transparency into whose perspectives and opinions LLMs may be preferentially representing by default versus when provided additional context cues. The overarching hypothesis seems to be that LLMs may disproportionately represent the opinions and viewpoints of certain groups more than others by default. The experiments then aim to test this by quantifying which countries' opinions the LLM responses are most similar to under different prompting conditions.In summary, the core research question is focused on developing a novel quantitative framework for evaluating whose opinions and perspectives LLMs align with, and using this methodology to assess potential biases in how different groups' views are represented. The key hypothesis is that LLMs may over-represent certain opinions more than others.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be:The development of a quantitative framework and dataset to evaluate how well large language models represent diverse global opinions and perspectives. The key elements of this contribution are:1) Compiling a new dataset called GlobalOpinionQA from established cross-national surveys (Pew Global Attitudes and World Values Survey). This provides a set of questions and human responses capturing opinions on societal issues across many different countries. 2) Defining a metric to quantify the similarity between a language model's responses to the survey questions and the actual human responses grouped by country. This allows measuring which human perspectives and opinions the model aligns with most closely.3) Applying this evaluation framework to test a large language model trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback and Constitutional AI. The experiments reveal biases in the model's default responses toward Western countries' opinions. Prompting the model from other countries' perspectives shifts responses but can reflect harmful stereotypes. 4) Releasing the dataset and an interactive visualization to support further research on evaluating representation of diverse global opinions in language models.In summary, the core contribution is creating a novel methodology and dataset to quantitatively assess whose opinions and perspectives language models align with. This sheds light on biases and could guide work toward more equitable AI systems. The release of the data and visualizations also enables future research in this direction.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper develops a framework to evaluate how similar large language model responses are to human survey responses on subjective questions across countries, finding the models' default responses tend to align more with Western viewpoints but prompts can steer responses towards different cultural perspectives, albeit sometimes in simplistic or stereotypical ways.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my reading, this paper makes a few notable contributions compared to prior work on evaluating social biases and representation in language models:1. It introduces a new dataset (GlobalOpinionQA) comprised of survey questions and responses designed to probe a diverse range of social values and perspectives across different countries. This provides a valuable resource for analyzing whether language models equitably represent global opinions. Previous related datasets have tended to focus more narrowly on specific biases or demographic groups. 2. The paper presents a quantitative evaluation framework to measure the similarity between language model outputs and human survey responses on an international level. This allows assessing which countries' opinions the model outputs are most aligned with by default, as well as how prompts can steer model outputs. Prior work has tended to rely more on qualitative analysis.3. The authors conduct controlled experiments manipulating the prompting context (cross-national, linguistic) to analyze how language models' outputs shift. This sheds light on the models' capabilities and limitations in adapting responses to different cultural frames of reference. Most prior work has evaluated models under default conditions without prompt variations.4. The analysis examines both high-level response distributions and detailed textual generations to provide a nuanced view into the models' knowledge and reasoning. Looking at both outputs is important for interpreting the results accurately.5. The paper makes the code, dataset, and a interactive visualization available to support further research and development of more culturally inclusive language models. This level of transparency is very valuable.Overall, this paper pushes forward technical methods for auditing and improving language models in regard to representing diverse social perspectives and values. It tackles the challenging problem of evaluating subjective social biases in a relatively rigorous way compared to previous related studies. The findings highlight important limitations, but also point towards future work on developing models with greater social awareness and cultural literacy.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:1. Building more inclusive training datasets and benchmarks to better evaluate models' abilities to represent diverse perspectives and values. The authors point out limitations in using the PEW and WVS surveys for this purpose, since they were not designed specifically to assess AI systems. So developing evaluations and data tailored for analyzing cultural representation in models could be valuable.2. Further analysis into why certain biases emerge in models, and how different training procedures (like RLHF and Constitutional AI) influence the values and viewpoints captured. The authors did not deeply investigate the root causes behind their results, so more research is needed.3. Exploring methods to mitigate issues around unequal representation or harmful stereotyping. The authors suggest some potential ideas like diversifying pretraining data, human labelers for RLHF, and constitutional principles for Constitutional AI. But they did not test interventions, so proposing and evaluating techniques to address the challenges is an area for future work.4. Applying the methodology to benchmark and compare different models in terms of global opinions represented. The current study focused on analyzing one model in depth as an initial demonstration of their framework. But expanding this to systematically evaluate a variety of models could further this line of research. 5. Incorporating more complex social science methods to account for diversity of opinions within countries. The authors acknowledge their approach of averaging survey responses within each country is a simplification. So devising more nuanced ways to handle conflicting viewpoints is another direction.Overall, the authors put forward their evaluation framework as an initial step towards transparency and accountability in analyzing subjective values encoded in models. But they emphasize that more research is needed to further develop methods in this problem space and work towards equitable AI systems that serve all people.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:This paper develops a framework to evaluate whose global perspectives and opinions large language models (LLMs) are most similar to when responding to subjective questions on societal issues. The authors compile survey questions from cross-national polls designed to capture diverse viewpoints across countries. They then compare LLM-generated responses to average human responses by country using a similarity metric. In three experiments, they find the LLM's default responses are most similar to Western nations, but prompting the model to consider a given country's opinions shifts responses toward that country's views, though sometimes reflecting stereotypes. Translating prompts to different languages does not necessarily make responses more representative of those populations. While the framework has limitations, it sheds light on potential biases in LLMs and could guide efforts to build models representing diverse global perspectives. Overall, this work highlights the need for language models to have deeper, nuanced understanding of diverse contexts and values.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper develops a framework to quantitatively evaluate how well large language models (LLMs) represent diverse global perspectives on societal issues. The authors compile survey questions from established cross-national polls, the Pew Global Attitudes Survey and World Values Survey, covering topics like politics, religion, and social values. They then ask these questions to an LLM trained to be helpful, honest and harmless. To evaluate the model, they compute the similarity between the LLM's predicted responses and the actual responses from survey participants across many countries. The authors run experiments prompting the model in different ways - with no country specified, prompted to consider a certain country's perspective, and prompted in non-English languages. They find the LLM's default responses are most similar to Western nations like the USA. Prompting for a given country makes responses more similar to that country but can reflect stereotypes. Translating questions does not necessarily make responses match countries where that language is spoken. While promisingly adaptable, the LLM requires deeper social understanding to reflect diverse global opinions. The authors release their dataset to help guide developing inclusive models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:The authors developed a framework to evaluate whose opinions large language model (LLM) generated responses are more similar to. They compiled a dataset of survey questions and responses from the Pew Global Attitudes Survey and World Values Survey covering diverse global perspectives. They then administered these survey questions to an LLM trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback and Constitutional AI. To evaluate the LLM, they computed the similarity between the probability distributions over the LLM's predicted responses and the averaged human responses per country. They conducted experiments administering the survey questions to the LLM under default prompting, cross-national prompting to consider a specific country's perspective, and translating the prompts into different languages. By analyzing the LLM's responses compared to human responses under these conditions, they assessed biases in whose opinions were represented or overlooked in the LLM's outputs. Their framework and findings highlight challenges for developing LLMs that equitably represent diverse global viewpoints.
