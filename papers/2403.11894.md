# [From explainable to interpretable deep learning for natural language   processing in healthcare: how far from reality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning (DL) has enhanced healthcare research by addressing natural language processing (NLP) tasks for analyzing textual data like electronic health records. However, the increasing complexity of DL models necessitates transparent interpretability or explainability for reliable decision-making.
- There is ambiguity in defining interpretable AI (IAI) versus explainable AI (XAI) and lack of clarity on model-based, input-based and output-based XAI methods.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces the term "XIAI" (eXplainable and Interpretable AI) to distinguish between IAI and XAI.
- It provides a comprehensive review of XIAI methods for DL-based NLP in healthcare, categorizing them as IAI versus XAI and local versus global scope.
- Further, XIAI methods are organized into model-based, input-based and output-based approaches based on their functionality.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis shows attention mechanisms are the most dominant emerging IAI method. Moreover, IAI is increasingly used against XAI recently.  
- Identifies key challenges like lack of global XIAI methods covering full modeling process, absence of best practices and benchmarks, unmet need for systematic XIAI evaluation.
- Discusses opportunities such as using attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine, combining DL with causal reasoning to boost interpretability.
- Recommends integrating XIAI in large language models and domain-specific smaller models to facilitate complex NLP adoption in healthcare.
- Provides insights to stimulate further research and benchmark studies towards improving inherent IAI and engaging NLP algorithms in healthcare settings.
