# [From explainable to interpretable deep learning for natural language   processing in healthcare: how far from reality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11894)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Deep learning (DL) has enhanced healthcare research by addressing natural language processing (NLP) tasks for analyzing textual data like electronic health records. However, the increasing complexity of DL models necessitates transparent interpretability or explainability for reliable decision-making.
- There is ambiguity in defining interpretable AI (IAI) versus explainable AI (XAI) and lack of clarity on model-based, input-based and output-based XAI methods.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper introduces the term "XIAI" (eXplainable and Interpretable AI) to distinguish between IAI and XAI.
- It provides a comprehensive review of XIAI methods for DL-based NLP in healthcare, categorizing them as IAI versus XAI and local versus global scope.
- Further, XIAI methods are organized into model-based, input-based and output-based approaches based on their functionality.

Main Contributions:
- Analysis shows attention mechanisms are the most dominant emerging IAI method. Moreover, IAI is increasingly used against XAI recently.  
- Identifies key challenges like lack of global XIAI methods covering full modeling process, absence of best practices and benchmarks, unmet need for systematic XIAI evaluation.
- Discusses opportunities such as using attention mechanisms to enhance multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine, combining DL with causal reasoning to boost interpretability.
- Recommends integrating XIAI in large language models and domain-specific smaller models to facilitate complex NLP adoption in healthcare.
- Provides insights to stimulate further research and benchmark studies towards improving inherent IAI and engaging NLP algorithms in healthcare settings.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is a thorough scoping review of explainable and interpretable deep learning (DL)-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques applied to healthcare. Specifically:

- The paper introduces the term "XIAI" (eXplainable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence) to distinguish between explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable AI (IAI). It provides definitions and categorizations of different XIAI methods.

- It conducts a systematic literature review of XIAI techniques for NLP in healthcare published between 2018-2022. The review analyzes publication trends, compares IAI vs XAI, categorizes methods into model-, input-, and output-based, and examines combinations with DL models, NLP tasks, and medical applications.  

- It identifies key opportunities and challenges for developing and applying XIAI methods in healthcare NLP. This includes needs for more "global" model interpretations, benchmark studies, evaluation metrics, and integration of attention mechanisms.

- It discusses the advantages and drawbacks of different XIAI paradigms (model-, input-, output-based), and provides perspectives on integrating XIAI into large language models vs domain-specific models.

In summary, the paper provides a thorough review and analysis to advance research and development of interpretable and explainable NLP techniques for reliable healthcare applications.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new term "XIAI" to distinguish between explainable AI (XAI) and interpretable AI (IAI). Can you elaborate on the key differences between XAI and IAI that motivated introducing this new term? 

2. The paper categorizes XIAI methods into model-based, input-based and output-based. Can you provide some examples of methods in each category and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages?

3. Attention mechanisms are identified as the most dominant emerging technique for interpretable AI. Why do you think attention mechanisms are well-suited for enhancing interpretability compared to other techniques?

4. The paper argues that most current XIAI methods are "local" rather than "global". What are some of the key challenges in developing "global" XIAI methods that provide end-to-end transparency into the modeling process?  

5. Causal representation learning is discussed as an emerging opportunity for improving inherent model interpretability. How specifically can incorporating causal logic into deep learning architectures enhance interpretability?

6. The paper emphasizes the need for systematic evaluation and benchmarks for XIAI methods. What specific evaluation metrics or benchmark datasets would you propose to rigorously assess XIAI techniques? 

7. Most of the analyzed papers use private medical datasets. What are some practical strategies to enable greater access to data to improve reproducibility of XIAI techniques?

8. What role can attention mechanisms play in multi-modal XIAI for personalized medicine by combining data sources like text, images, genetics?

9. How can domain experts and end-users be involved in the design, development and evaluation of XIAI to accelerate their translation and systematization? 

10. The paper discusses integration of XIAI in large language models versus domain-specific smaller models. What factors should guide this design choice for healthcare NLP applications?
