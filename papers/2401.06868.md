# [Multicriteria decision support employing adaptive prediction in a   tensor-based feature representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06868)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) aims to rank alternatives based on multiple criteria, but most methods use a single static value for each criterion rather than considering temporal evaluations over time. 
- Time series analysis is important for decision making in many real-world contexts, but few MCDA studies have focused on incorporating time series data.
- Prior time series approaches in MCDA often aggregate data in multiple steps, while a unified approach could better leverage temporal characteristics.

Proposed Solution:
- Represent past time series data for alternatives and criteria in a 3D tensor structure.
- Apply recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive prediction to forecast future values for each criterion.
- Extract features (mean, slope, variation) from predicted time series and structure into a feature tensor.   
- Introduce a new extension of the PROMETHEE II MCDA method to handle tensor inputs and provide a ranking of alternatives.

Key Contributions:
- Novel unified methodology to incorporate adaptive prediction of criteria time series into MCDA ranking using a tensor representation. 
- Handles non-stationary time series data through adaptive models tuned to capture changes over time.
- Computes rankings based on predictive features rather than only current evaluations, enabling more informed decisions.
- Introduces new PROMETHEE II formulation to support tensor inputs for enhanced multidimensional analysis.
- Evaluates approach on real-world financial time series data and compares to other MCDA strategies.

The proposed approach effectively leverages signal processing and tensor methods to improve time-aware decision making in complex multidimensional problems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel approach for multicriteria decision analysis that utilizes tensor representations, adaptive prediction methods, and an extension of the PROMETHEE II method to rank alternatives based on predicted time series features extracted from criteria evaluations over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel methodology for multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) that utilizes tensor representations, adaptive prediction methods from signal processing, and an extension of the PROMETHEE II method. Specifically:

- It represents the temporal evaluation of criteria for alternatives as a tensor, allowing the incorporation of time series data. 

- It applies adaptive prediction (using the RLS algorithm) to predict future values of the criteria time series. These predicted values are structured as a tensor.

- Features are extracted from the predicted criteria values tensor and represented as a new tensor. This allows using informative characteristics of the predicted signals.  

- An extension of the PROMETHEE II method is introduced to obtain a ranking of the alternatives from the tensor of extracted features. This allows handling the tensorial data structure in the MCDA aggregation process.

The proposed approach is aimed at exploiting temporal characteristics and non-stationary behaviors in the criteria evaluation, which provides added value for decision-making compared to classical static MCDA methods. The experiments on real-world financial time series data demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel methodology that uses a decision tensor of past time series to predict future time series of the criteria. How is this different from previous approaches that use only current or past criteria values in MCDA methods? What are the main advantages of using predicted future criteria values?

2. Explain in detail the prediction step used in the proposed method. What algorithm is used for prediction and why? How are the predicted values structured into a tensor?

3. The predicted criteria values are transformed from the time domain into a features domain. What specific features are extracted from the predicted time series and why are these useful for multicriteria decision analysis?

4. The paper introduces an extension of the PROMETHEE II method to handle tensor inputs. Explain in detail the steps involved in this extension, including the pairwise comparisons, preference functions, criteria weights, and final aggregation.  

5. In the numerical experiments, the proposed method is compared to several other approaches, including benchmark rankings and classical MCDA methods. Summarize the key findings from these comparisons. What do they reveal about the usefulness of the proposed strategy?

6. The numerical experiments consider both RLS and NLMS for prediction. How do the results differ when using these two algorithms? What does this suggest about the importance of the prediction method?

7. The PROMETHEE extension is compared to a TOPSIS extension from previous work. Why do these two methods produce different rankings even when using the same prediction input? What does this highlight about developing tensor-based MCDA techniques?

8. One of the key ideas motivating the paper is the concept of prediction error and how it may or may not affect the final ranking. Based on the results, discuss whether and how prediction error impacts the performance of the proposed approach.

9. The paper claims the method is especially useful when criteria time series are non-stationary. Explain what is meant by non-stationarity and how the numerical experiments provide evidence to support this claim.

10. What are some of the limitations of the current study and how might the method be expanded or improved in future work? What other types of criteria data or decision problems could benefit from this tensor prediction approach?
