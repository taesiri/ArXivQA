# [Language Models, Agent Models, and World Models: The LAW for Machine   Reasoning and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05230)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces the LAW framework as a new conceptual approach for more robust machine reasoning. The framework combines language models (LMs), world models (WMs), and agent models (AMs). The core idea is that WMs and AMs provide a better abstraction for reasoning compared to using LMs directly. In particular, WMs and AMs incorporate key elements missing from LMs, including beliefs, reward functions, future state anticipation, and planning - enabling more deliberate and goal-directed reasoning resembling humans. Under this framework, LMs serve mainly as the computational backend to implement the reasoning system and components, leveraging their power, flexibility, and ability to handle noisy real-world data. The paper reviews recent progress aligned with aspects of this framework, such as using LMs as planners in AMs, and discusses limitations of current LMs for robust world/agent modeling. It proposes research directions for advancing LMs' reasoning capacity by enhancing their world knowledge learning through embodied interactions and introducing multimodality. Overall, the LAW framework and LM backend aim to achieve more general, consistent, and human-like reasoning across diverse language, embodied, and social scenarios.
