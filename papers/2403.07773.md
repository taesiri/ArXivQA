# [SemCity: Semantic Scene Generation with Triplane Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07773)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Generating realistic 3D scenes of outdoor environments is challenging, especially for real-world data which contains more empty space compared to synthetic data. 
- Existing 3D diffusion models focus more on generating single objects or indoor scenes. Outdoor scene generation is still an open research problem.

Proposed Method: 
- The paper proposes "SemCity", a 3D diffusion model to generate semantic outdoor scenes using a triplane representation which is more efficient than voxels. 
- A triplane autoencoder is used to encode a voxelized input scene into a compact triplane representation consisting of 3 orthogonal planes. 
- A triplane diffusion model is then trained to generate novel realistic triplanes capturing distribution of real outdoor scenes.
- The generated triplane can be decoded into a full 3D semantic scene using the pretrained autoencoder decoder.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstrates triplane representation is better than voxels for modelling real outdoor scene distribution using a diffusion model.
- Achieves high-quality semantic outdoor scene generation on real-world SemanticKITTI dataset.
- Proposes triplane manipulation techniques to enable applications like scene inpainting, outpainting and refinement of semantic scene completion networks.
- Scene outpainting can expand input scene to large city-scale environments.
- Refinement of state-of-the-art semantic scene completion networks enhances completeness and segmentation quality.

In summary, the paper presents a novel triplane diffusion model for semantic outdoor scene generation and manipulation, with applications in semantic scene completion, inpainting and city-scale environment modelling. The method is shown to generate higher quality scenes compared to voxel-based approaches.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents "SemCity", a 3D diffusion framework for generating realistic semantic outdoor scenes using a triplane representation to efficiently model complex real-world environments and enable practical applications like scene inpainting, outpainting, and refinement of semantic scene completion results.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) Proposing a 3D diffusion framework called "SemCity" for semantic scene generation in real-world outdoor environments using a triplane representation. This allows efficiently generating detailed and semantically coherent outdoor scenes.

2) Extending the triplane diffusion model to various practical downstream tasks via triplane manipulation, including semantic scene completion refinement, scene outpainting, and scene inpainting. This allows seamlessly adding, removing, or modifying objects within a scene while maintaining coherence.

3) Demonstrating that the proposed triplane diffusion model shows significantly improved semantic scene generation results on real-world datasets compared to prior work. The model also facilitates expanding scenes to city-scale through outpainting.

4) Showing that incorporating the triplane diffusion model as a refinement step improves state-of-the-art semantic scene completion methods by better aligning the predicted scenes with real data distributions.

In summary, the main contribution is a new triplane diffusion framework for high-quality semantic outdoor scene generation and manipulation, with applications in tasks like semantic completion refinement.
