# [A Review of Cooperation in Multi-agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05162)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper provides a comprehensive review of cooperation in multi-agent learning (MAL). It covers key concepts and challenges in both team-based MAL, where agents share common goals, and mixed-motive MAL, where individual and collective incentives can conflict. Core challenges include non-stationarity, scalability in number of agents, credit assignment, and generalizing to novel partners. For team games, popular algorithms utilizing centralized training with decentralized execution, communication, and credit assignment are discussed. For mixed motives, methods leveraging other-regarding preferences, other-influence, reputation and norms, and contracts are reviewed, with a focus on resolving social dilemmas. Environments and evaluation metrics are also surveyed. Open questions are raised around integrating large language models as agents, improving generalization to unfamiliar partners at test time, and developing standardized benchmark tasks and metrics to measure cooperativeness. The review synthesizes a broad range of interdisciplinary work at the intersection of game theory, economics, evolutionary biology and social sciences.
