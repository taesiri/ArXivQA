# [Reinforcement Learning with Latent State Inference for Autonomous   On-ramp Merging under Observation Delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11852)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the challenging problem of autonomous on-ramp merging of self-driving vehicles onto busy multi-lane highways. The key difficulties include reasoning about surrounding vehicles' intents and driving styles to optimize merging maneuvers, ensure traffic efficiency and driving safety. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a Lane-keeping, Lane-changing with Latent-state Inference and Safety Controller (L3IS) agent to perform the highway on-ramp merging task. The key components of L3IS are:

1. Lane-Keeping (LK) agent: A proximal policy optimization (PPO) based deep reinforcement learning agent to control longitudinal acceleration. 

2. Lane-Changing (LC) agent: A deep Q-network agent to make lane changing decisions.

3. Supervised Learning (SL) agent: Predicts surrounding vehicles' driving styles (aggressive or cooperative) from observable states.

4. Safety controller: Validates and overrides unsafe LK and LC actions predicted by the learning agents.

An augmented version called AL3IS is also introduced to handle vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication delays using past observations and actions.

Main Contributions:

1. A principled framework combining reinforcement learning, supervised learning and safety control for on-ramp merging.

2. Systematic handling of V2V communication delays using augmented POMDP states.

3. Extensive simulation evaluation using real-world traffic data showing superior performance over baselines. L3IS achieved 99.9% success rate.

4. AL3IS maintained 93.84% success rate even with 1 sec delays, showcasing robustness to real-world imperfect communication.

In summary, the paper makes important contributions towards safe and efficient autonomous on-ramp merging by reasoning about surrounding vehicles and handling practical challenges like observation delays.
