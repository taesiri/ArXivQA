# [General Tail Bounds for Non-Smooth Stochastic Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07142)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper provides novel tail bounds on the optimization error of Stochastic Mirror Descent when minimizing a non-smooth convex and Lipschitz function given only noisy gradient access. The analysis extends existing tail bounds beyond the classical sub-Gaussian noise setting to consider heavier-tailed noise models such as sub-Weibull distributions (which include sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential as special cases) and distributions with polynomially decaying tails. Tail bounds are derived both for the error of the average iterate as well as the last iterate. The bounds hold without requiring an upper bound on the diameter of the domain. For the average iterate case, some results exhibit a two-regime phenomenon where the heavy-tailed contribution decays faster as the iteration horizon grows. The analysis introduces techniques to disentangle the effect of the domain from the statistical properties of the noise. Overall, the paper significantly expands the range of problems and noise models for which optimization error tail bounds are available for Stochastic Mirror Descent and supports the theory with illustrative experiments.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper provides novel tail bounds on the optimization error of Stochastic Mirror Descent for convex and Lipschitz objectives, extending existing analysis from light-tailed sub-Gaussian noise regimes to heavier-tailed noise models including sub-Weibull and polynomially decaying tails.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It provides novel tail bounds on the optimization error of Stochastic Mirror Descent (SMD) for convex and Lipschitz objectives under two types of heavy-tailed noise models - a class of sub-Weibull noise and one with polynomial tails. This extends existing tail bounds that are primarily derived under light-tailed sub-Gaussian noise assumptions.

2) The tail bounds are provided for both the average of the SMD iterates as well as the last iterate. For the average iterate case, some of the bounds exhibit an intriguing "two-regime" phenomenon where the effect of the heavy-tailed noise decays faster as the optimization horizon grows.

3) The analysis does not require an upper bound on the diameter of the domain, which is often needed for proving convergence rates. This makes the results more widely applicable.

4) The techniques used, such as disentangling the effect of the iterates from the noise terms using novel weighting schemes, are fairly general and could be useful for analyzing other stochastic optimization algorithms under heavy-tailed noise.

5) The theoretical findings are supplemented with experiments comparing the last iterate and average iterate performance. The experiments confirm the increased robustness of averaging in heavy-tailed settings predicted by the theory.

In summary, the paper significantly expands the existing analysis of SMD to more realistic noise models while providing modular analysis techniques of independent interest.

The paper studies tail bounds on the optimization error of stochastic mirror descent algorithms under heavy-tailed noise assumptions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper derives high probability bounds on the optimization error for stochastic mirror descent under two types of heavy-tailed noise - sub-Weibull noise and noise with polynomially decaying tails. How do you think the analysis would differ if other types of heavy-tailed distributions were considered, such as lognormal or Pareto noise?

2. For the average iterate analysis, the paper introduces a novel weighting scheme that allows disentangling the effect of the domain vectors $x_t - x^*$ from the noise terms. What are the key challenges in extending this scheme to other first-order black-box optimization methods like stochastic gradient descent?

3. The derived bounds for the average iterate exhibit an intriguing two-regime phenomenon where the effect of the heavy-tailed noise decays faster as the iteration horizon grows. What are your thoughts on why this behavior is not observed in the case of the last iterate? 

4. The analysis relies on several concentration inequalities for martingales with heavy-tailed increments. Can you think of other relevant concentration results that could be used to tighten or generalize the obtained bounds?

5. The paper focuses solely on deriving generalization bounds. How would you go about analyzing the algorithm's convergence rate and characterizing its iteration complexity under the heavy-tailed noise models considered?

6. The deterministic setting is recovered when the noise magnitude goes to zero. Do you think the heavy-tailed noise affects the dependence of the bounds on other problem parameters like the domain diameter or Lipschitz constant?

7. Truncating or clipping the stochastic gradients is a common approach for coping with extreme noise. What advantages or disadvantages do you see in analyzing the unmodified stochastic mirror descent scheme? 

8. The experiments highlight the greater sensitivity of the last iterate to heavy-tailed noise compared to the average iterate. Can you think of ways to improve the robustness of the last iterate?

9. The analysis relies on several auxiliary results concerning properties of sub-Weibull random variables. What are some open problems regarding the study or application of this family of distributions?

10. The paper adopts a modular analysis approach to derive high probability bounds, separating the effect of the noise terms as much as possible. How could this modular approach be leveraged to analyze stochastic mirror descent variants or other related stochastic optimization methods?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
- The paper studies stochastic mirror descent (SMD), which is used for large-scale optimization and statistical risk minimization. SMD generalizes stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to non-Euclidean settings. 
- Most theoretical analyses of SMD assume sub-Gaussian noise. However, in many practical applications, the noise is heavy-tailed. There is limited understanding of the performance of SMD under such noise regimes.
- The paper aims to provide novel tail bounds on the optimization error of SMD under heavy-tailed noise distributions, including sub-Weibull and polynomially decaying tails. The bounds apply to both the average iterate and the last iterate.

Proposed Solution - Key Ideas:

For Average Iterate:
- Provides a general bound relying on tail properties of certain martingales arising from the noise terms. Instantiates the bound for sub-Weibull and polynomial tail noise.
- The bounds exhibit a two-regime behavior when the time horizon is long - initially dominated by heavy tails but eventually approaching the sub-Gaussian rate.
- Avoids relying on a diameter bound for the domain by using a novel weighting scheme in the analysis.

For Last Iterate:  
- Unrolls recurrence relations tracking the error over recent iterates to relate error to martingales involving noise terms.
- Shows the total quadratic variation of these martingales can be related back to the martingales themselves via the maximum distances between recent iterates.
- Uses this to derive time-uniform exponential concentration results for the martingales, leading to high probability bound on the error.

Key Results:
- Precise non-asymptotic tail bounds on the optimization error that apply to individual runs of SMD under two models of heavy-tailed noise, with explicit dependence on confidence level and time horizon.  
- Bounds for both the averaging scheme and using the last iterate.
- Interesting "two-regime" phenomenon exhibited for the average iterate bound.
- Experiments investigating the differing behavior of average vs last iterate in practice.

Main Contributions:
- First precise non-asymptotic analyses of SMD under sub-Weibull and polynomially tailed noise without gradient clipping/truncation.
- Novel proof techniques to disentangle the effect of noise terms from geometry of iterates.
- Insight into the performance difference between averaging and last iterate schemes under heavy-tailed noise.
