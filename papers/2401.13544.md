# [Beyond Concept Bottleneck Models: How to Make Black Boxes Intervenable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13544)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict targets via high-level human-understandable concepts. A key advantage of CBMs is that they allow for concept-based interventions - a user can edit the predicted concepts and affect the final prediction. However, CBMs require concept knowledge and labels during training. The paper tackles two problems: (1) How to perform concept-based interventions on black-box models without changing architectures or needing concepts during training? (2) How to make black-box models more amenable to such interventions?

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes an intervention procedure for black-box neural networks using a probe trained on concepts and validation data to align representations with user-provided concepts. It also introduces a measure called "intervenability" to quantify the effectiveness of interventions and uses this measure as a loss to fine-tune black-box models.  

Key Contributions:
- Devises a simple yet effective procedure for concept-based interventions on black-box neural networks using a probe and representation editing.
- Formalizes intervenability as a measure of intervention effectiveness.
- Introduces a novel fine-tuning strategy for black-box models based on the intervenability measure to make them more amenable to concept-based interventions.
- Empirically demonstrates that the proposed techniques allow black-box models to be intervened upon and often improve performance over vanilla black-boxes and even concept bottleneck models on complex realistic tasks.
- Showcases the practical utility of enabling interventions on black-box medical image classifiers without needing concept labels during training.

Overall, the paper expands the applicability of concept-based interventions to practical black-box models by devising methods to perform interventions without changing architectures or needing concept labels a priori while formalizing intervention effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key ideas presented in the paper:

The paper introduces methods to perform concept-based interventions on black-box neural networks post hoc, proposes a measure called intervenability to quantify the effectiveness of such interventions, and shows how to improve intervenability via fine-tuning while preserving the original model architecture and representations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes several contributions to research on concept bottleneck models and concept-based interventions:

1) It introduces a method to perform concept-based, instance-specific interventions on already-trained black-box neural networks, without needing concept labels during training or altering the model architecture. This only requires fitting a probe model and editing activations based on user-provided concept values.

2) It formalizes a measure called "intervenability" to quantify the effectiveness of concept-based interventions on a model. 

3) It proposes a fine-tuning procedure that optimizes intervenability as a loss function in order to improve the effectiveness of interventions on black-box models.

4) It empirically demonstrates that fine-tuning for intervenability enhances the performance of interventions and often leads to better-calibrated predictions. Experiments on synthetic, image, and medical datasets show that fine-tuned black boxes can become as intervenable as concept bottleneck models.

In summary, the main contribution is a method to perform concept-based interventions on black-box models post-hoc, a formalization of intervenability, and a fine-tuning strategy to explicitly improve a model's amenability to such interventions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Concept bottleneck models (CBMs)
- Concept-based interventions 
- Instance-specific interventions
- Intervenability 
- Fine-tuning for intervenability
- Probing functions
- Black-box models
- Interpretability
- Explainability

The paper introduces techniques for performing concept-based, instance-specific interventions on black-box neural network models post-training, given a set of concepts and a labeled validation set. It also formalizes the notion of "intervenability" to quantify the effectiveness of such interventions, and proposes a fine-tuning procedure to improve a model's intervenability. Other key ideas include training simple probing functions to predict concepts from a model's internal representations, and editing those representations to align with user-provided concept values in order to influence the model's predictions. The techniques are meant to bring some degree of interpretability and human controllability to otherwise opaque neural network models.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a measure called "intervenability" to quantify the effectiveness of concept-based interventions on a model. How is this measure formally defined, and what are its connections to similar ideas like model reliance or variable importance?

2. The paper proposes a 3-step procedure for performing concept-based interventions on black-box neural networks. Can you walk through each step in detail and highlight the key ideas and design choices involved? 

3. The paper argues that fine-tuning a black-box model for intervenability can improve the effectiveness of interventions. Explain the fine-tuning procedure, objective function, and training process in detail. What is the intuition behind why this helps?

4. The paper explores both linear and non-linear probes for predicting concepts from activations. What differences did the authors observe between these two types of probes and what reasons might explain those differences?

5. The paper compares the proposed fine-tuning approach to several baseline techniques like multitask learning. Summarize these baselines and discuss the relative benefits and limitations of each method based on the empirical results.  

6. How were the interventions strategies defined in this paper and what impact did the choice of strategy have on the effectiveness of interventions? Discuss the tradeoffs.

7. One design choice in the 3-step procedure is the distance function used when editing representations. Analyze the effect of using Euclidean versus cosine distance based on the results. What factors might determine a good choice of distance?

8. Compare and contrast the behavior of black-box models versus concept bottleneck models in the experiments, especially on more complex real-world datasets. When might one approach be preferred over the other?

9. The paper argues that fine-tuning for intervenability improves calibration of predictions. Explain why this might occur and discuss the calibration results. 

10. What limitations of the current method are identified? Suggest some directions for future work to address those limitations or build upon the approach.
