# [Digital Twins and Civil Engineering Phases: Reorienting Adoption   Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
The adoption of digital twin (DT) technology has been slow in the civil engineering industry compared to other fields like manufacturing. This is due to the complexity of civil engineering projects across different phases - planning/design, construction, and operations/maintenance. Each phase has unique challenges and existing technologies like BIM, sensors, IoT etc. have limitations in enabling full-fledged DT capabilities. As a result, DT applications have been fragmented, focused mainly on the operations phase, lacking a holistic lifecycle view.

Proposed Solution:
The paper systematically analyzes the conventional techniques and technologies employed at each civil engineering phase. It then explores how these techniques along with new advances can come together to realize DT capabilities for holistic adoption across project lifecycles. 

For the planning/design phase, the advancements around BIM like sustainability analysis, Scan-to-BIM, IoT integration etc. set the foundation for DT development in later phases. Indirect DT can be created using historical data to optimize new designs.  

In the construction phase, BIM, sensing and IoT play central roles. However real-time bidirectional connectivity between digital and physical twins remains challenging due to the transient nature of construction. DT techniques for construction focus on progress monitoring, safety, clash detection etc. with level 3-4 capabilities.

For the operations phase, DT leverages advances in structural health monitoring (SHM) like computer vision, model updating and uncertainty quantification to enable diagnostic as well as prognostic evaluations in real-time. This allows not just damage detection but also preventive maintenance, lifecycle assessment and mission planning optimization.  

Key Contributions:
1) Establishes DT as an important system across civil engineering project lifecycles, countering the notion of DT adoption being limited mainly to operations.

2) Provides conceptual clarity on components of DT development, associated techniques/enabling technologies at each project phase.

3) Systematically reviews literature to reveal the present level of DT capabilities at each phase, giving insights into forward-thinking approaches for accelerated, holistic adoption of DT in civil engineering industry.
