# [Unsolved Problems in ML Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13916)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, this paper does not seem to have a single central research question or hypothesis. Instead, it provides an overview of important open problems and research directions in the field of machine learning safety. The key points I took away are:

- Machine learning systems are being deployed in increasingly high-stakes environments, so safety should be a top research priority. 

- The authors identify four key problem areas for ML safety research: robustness, monitoring, alignment, and systemic safety.

- For each problem area, they discuss the motivation and provide concrete research directions to make progress. 

- The goal is to build a strong ML safety research community and develop solutions proactively, rather than waiting for catastrophes to happen before addressing safety. 

- This is a non-exhaustive list, focusing on problems that seem most pressing given recent advances in large-scale ML models.

So in summary, this paper aims to survey the ML safety landscape, highlight critical open problems, and provide guidance for research priorities - rather than testing a specific hypothesis. The overarching goal is to promote safety as a core value as ML systems continue to advance.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 According to the paper, the authors propose four key areas for future research on ML safety:

1. Robustness
- Improving robustness to black swan events, long tails, and adversarial examples. This includes developing new benchmarks, simulating unusual data, and creating more adaptive and robust models.

2. Monitoring  
- Enhancing anomaly detection, making model outputs more representative and honest, and detecting hidden functionality like backdoors and emergent capabilities. Specific directions include improving OOD detection, calibration, truthfulness, and techniques to audit models.

3. Alignment
- Advancing value learning, translating values into actions, dealing with proxy gaming, value clarification, and unintended consequences. This involves modeling human values, optimizing complex objectives, identifying proxy vulnerabilities, philosophizing about ethics, and creating cautious agents. 

4. Systemic Safety
- Using ML for cybersecurity through intrusion detection, analyzing code, and patching vulnerabilities. Also improving decision making via forecasting events and surfacing considerations for policymakers and command centers.

In summary, the key directions are making ML systems more robust, monitorable, aligned with human values, and safely integrated into the broader sociotechnical system. The authors provide an extensive set of concrete problems to work on within each of these high-level research areas.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a research roadmap for machine learning (ML) safety and outlines four key problem areas: robustness, monitoring, alignment, and systemic safety. The motivation for focusing on ML safety is that as ML systems become more powerful and widely deployed, unsafe systems could lead to catastrophic outcomes. The paper argues that safety should be a top priority now, rather than waiting for accidents to happen or solely relying on regulations. 

The four problem areas aim to make ML systems endure extreme events (robustness), identify potential hazards (monitoring), optimize objectives that align with human values (alignment), and address safety risks from deployment contexts (systemic safety). For each area, the authors describe the motivation and provide concrete research directions. Overall, the goal is to build a strong ML safety research community and steer the development of ML in a way that maximizes societal benefit. The paper concludes that progress in all four areas is interconnected and essential for comprehensive protection against safety threats.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents a machine learning approach for improving the adversarial robustness of neural networks. The key method is adversarial training, where the model is trained not just on the original training data but also on adversarial examples generated by perturbing the original examples. Specifically, for each original training example, the authors generate an adversarial example by taking a small step in the direction that most increases the model's loss. This adversarial example is then included in the training data along with the original example. By training on both original and adversarial examples, the model is forced to learn more robust features that generalize better, rather than relying on brittle features that can be easily fooled by small perturbations. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet, the authors demonstrate that adversarial training leads to substantially improved adversarial robustness compared to vanilla training or other defense methods. The main contribution is presenting adversarial training as an effective technique for hardening neural networks against adversarial attacks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing several important problems related to machine learning safety. Some of the key problems discussed include:

- Robustness to long tail events and "black swan" scenarios that ML systems may not have encountered before. The paper argues current ML systems are often brittle when faced with unfamiliar or extreme inputs.

- Adversarial robustness, meaning the vulnerability of ML systems to carefully crafted attacks designed to cause misclassifications or malfunctions. 

- Monitoring ML systems through anomaly detection to identify hazards or misuse, ensuring model outputs are representative and not deceptive, and detecting hidden functionality like backdoors.

- Alignment of ML system objectives with human values and preventing unintended consequences. This includes challenges like specifying human values accurately, translating abstract values into concrete actions, avoiding gaming of objectives, and handling complex tradeoffs.

- Broader systemic issues like cybersecurity risks for ML and improving decision-making related to powerful ML systems.

The paper aims to identify concrete research directions and problems that are important to work on but remain unsolved in order to make progress on ML safety and prevent accidents or misuse of increasingly powerful ML systems.
