# [Self-supervised learning of visual features through embedding images   into text topic spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08631)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:Can we learn useful visual features in a self-supervised manner by training a CNN to predict the semantic context that images illustrate, using freely available multi-modal (image + text) data?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) The semantic topics discovered from text in illustrated articles can provide supervision signals for training a CNN, despite being noisy. 2) By training a CNN to predict which semantic topic an image most likely illustrates, the network will learn visual features that capture semantic relationships and are useful for visual tasks like classification and retrieval.3) The self-supervised features learned this way, without human annotations, can compete with or exceed other unsupervised and self-supervised methods on benchmark tasks.So in summary, the central research question is whether semantic topics from text can provide a supervisory signal for self-supervised visual feature learning from multi-modal data, to learn features that capture semantic relationships and work well for vision tasks. The key hypotheses are that the noisy semantic supervision can still be effective, and the learned features will be useful compared to other unsupervised methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method for self-supervised learning of visual features by leveraging the correlation between images and text in illustrated articles. Specifically:- The paper proposes training a CNN to predict the semantic text topics that an image illustrates, using LDA topic modeling on the articles' text. - This allows the CNN to learn useful visual features in a self-supervised manner, without requiring manually annotated image datasets.- The learned features are evaluated on image classification, object detection, and multi-modal retrieval tasks, showing competitive performance compared to other self-supervised and unsupervised methods.- The model can naturally perform multi-modal retrieval, searching images by text queries or vice versa, without needing any extra annotation or learning.In summary, the key contribution is using the co-occurrence of images and text topics in illustrated articles as a supervisory signal for self-supervised learning of visual features in a CNN, which is shown to work well despite the noise in matching images to text topics.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a self-supervised method for training a CNN to predict the semantic context of images by leveraging freely available multi-modal data of illustrated articles and modeling text with LDA topic modeling.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points about how this paper compares to other research in self-supervised learning of visual features:- The main novelty is using textual semantic information as the supervisory signal for training a CNN to predict image topic distributions. Prior self-supervised methods have used other signals like ego-motion, audio, etc. but not text. Leveraging text is a natural fit since text is commonly used to annotate images.- The results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to other self-supervised methods on standard benchmarks like PASCAL classification and detection. The learned features even outperform some unsupervised methods like k-means clustering.- The idea is related to prior work on multimodal topic modeling for annotation and retrieval, but differs in using it for self-supervised CNN pre-training. So it explores a new application of topic models.- An appealing aspect is the ability to naturally do bi-directional image-text retrieval since images and text are embedded in a common semantic space. This is a novel capability compared to other self-supervised approaches.- A limitation is performance remains below fully supervised pre-training, which is expected. The method likely learns more generic features due to noise in matching images with article text. Using cleaner image captions improves performance.- The work reinforces the viability of self-supervised learning as an alternative to costly annotation for pre-training visual features. It expands the modalities that can be used for self-supervision in a novel way by exploiting image-text data.In summary, the key novelty is the use of freely available text as supervision signal, with results that are state-of-the-art for self-supervised methods and competitive with some unsupervised techniques. The work expands the scope of self-supervised learning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest the following future research directions:- Exploring other types of noisy/weak text labels for self-supervision, like image alt-text or meta-data labels, to analyze how these affect the quality of the learned features. - Combining text-based self-supervision with other modalities like audio or video for learning visual-semantic embeddings. This could provide complementary supervisory signals.- Evaluating the learned features on other vision tasks beyond classification, detection and retrieval, such as segmentation, action recognition, etc. - Developing end-to-end models that can directly predict text (topics, captions, etc) from images, instead of just using text as an intermediate supervisory signal.- Applying the idea of leveraging correlations between vision and language for self-supervision to other modalities like video. For example, learning from narrated instructional videos.- Exploring if finetuning on large supervised datasets like ImageNet or COCO can improve results further, since the authors demonstrate the features still have room for improvement compared to fully supervised methods.- Analyzing in more depth what linguistic knowledge the model learns about objects, relations, attributes, etc. and how it represents semantics.In summary, the main future directions are exploring other text sources for self-supervision, combining with other modalities, applying to new tasks, developing end-to-end vision-language models, transferring to other domains like video, and analyzing what linguistic knowledge the models acquire.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a self-supervised method for learning visual features from multi-modal data without human annotations. The key idea is to leverage the correlation between images and text in illustrated articles to provide a supervisory signal for training a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, the text is represented as a topic distribution using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The CNN is then trained to predict the topic distribution of an image based on its pixels. This teaches the CNN to learn visual features that capture semantic information about object categories and contexts. Experiments demonstrate that the learned features achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and multi-modal retrieval compared to other self-supervised approaches. A key advantage is the ability to perform both visual and textual image retrieval in a common semantic space. Overall, this work shows how multi-modal correlations can be exploited for self-supervised learning of useful visual representations without manual annotation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper presents a method for self-supervised learning of visual features by mining a large corpus of illustrated Wikipedia articles. The key idea is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the semantic context that an image is likely to appear in, based on the text of the Wikipedia article it is from. First, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is used to discover topics from the corpus of Wikipedia articles. Each article is represented as a distribution over topics. Then, a CNN is trained to predict these topic distributions directly from image pixels. By learning to predict which semantic topics an image is likely to illustrate, the CNN learns useful visual features in a self-supervised manner, without requiring manually labeled data. Experiments demonstrate that the learned features provide state-of-the-art performance compared to other self-supervised methods on tasks like image classification, object detection, and multi-modal retrieval. A key advantage of this method is the ability to seamlessly perform retrieval in both visual and textual domains.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:This paper presents a self-supervised learning method that leverages freely available illustrated articles (image-text pairs) to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for visual feature learning. The key idea is to use the text in the articles as a supervisory signal for the CNN by representing the text semantically at the topic level. The text articles are analyzed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to discover underlying topics and represent each article as a topic probability distribution. The CNN is then trained to predict the topic distribution of an article directly from its accompanying images. By learning to predict the semantic textual context of images, the CNN learns discriminative visual features without requiring manual image annotations. The learned features can then be used for various computer vision tasks like classification and retrieval. Experiments demonstrate performance competitive with supervised methods on standard datasets. A key advantage of this self-supervised approach is the ability to leverage abundant multi-modal data to learn visual representations, without needing laborious human annotation.
