# [Fine-Grained Human Feedback Gives Better Rewards for Language Model   Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01693)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is:How can we improve rewards for language model training via RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback) by using more fine-grained human feedback?The authors propose that using more fine-grained human feedback as training signals, instead of just overall human preferences, can help train language models more effectively and efficiently to generate desired outputs. Specifically, they collect human feedback that categorizes and localizes different types of errors (e.g. factual errors, irrelevant text) at different levels of granularity (e.g. sentence, sub-sentence). They then train separate reward models for each error type and granularity level, and incorporate these into a RLHF training framework called Fine-Grained RLHF. Experiments on detoxification and long-form QA aim to demonstrate the benefits of using such fine-grained rewards compared to standard holistic preference-based rewards.In summary, the central hypothesis is that fine-grained human feedback can lead to better rewards and improved language model training via RLHF compared to commonly used holistic preferences. The experiments aim to support this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. Introducing a new reinforcement learning framework called Fine-Grained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Fine-Grained RLHF). This framework enables training language models using reward functions that are fine-grained in two respects:- Density - Providing rewards frequently at a segment level (e.g. per sentence) rather than just at the end of the full generated text.- Multiple reward models - Using separate reward models for different types of feedback on undesired behaviors (e.g. factuality, relevance, completeness). 2. Demonstrating improved performance on two text generation tasks (detoxification and long-form QA) using fine-grained rewards compared to reinforcement learning with holistic/overall rewards on full sequences. This is shown through both automatic metrics and human evaluation.3. Showing the ability to customize language model behavior by adjusting the weights of different fine-grained reward models during training. This allows balancing different desired attributes like conciseness vs completeness.4. Analysis of the fine-grained reward models, including their performance, how they compete/tradeoff, and their impact on the trained policy model.5. Release of a new dataset called QA-Feedback with long-form question answering examples annotated with fine-grained human feedback.In summary, the key ideas are using more granular and multi-faceted human feedback to train language models more effectively and provide more control compared to holistic judgements on full sequences. The improved performance and customizability is demonstrated empirically on two tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework called FINE that enables training language models using multiple fine-grained reward functions, each focusing on detecting a specific type of undesirable generation behavior at different levels of granularity, to better align model outputs with human preferences compared to training with a single holistic reward function.
