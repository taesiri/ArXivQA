# [A General and Efficient Federated Split Learning with Pre-trained Image   Transformers for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16050)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are distributed machine learning paradigms that aim to train models collaboratively while preserving data privacy. However, they have limitations in terms of communication overhead (FL) and computing resource constraints (SL).  
- Federated split learning (FSL) combines FL and SL to reduce communication costs and training overhead, but prior works use simple models like CNNs. Transformers have advantages but training them from scratch has huge resource requirements.
- There is no prior work systematically evaluating FSL with pre-trained image transformers (PITs) on heterogeneous data and considering model privacy issues like gradient attacks.

Proposed Solution:
- Incorporate PITs into FSL to accelerate training and enhance model robustness, called FES-PIT. Split the PIT into client-side head/tail networks and server-side encoder.
- Further propose FES-PTZO using zeroth-order optimization to approximate server gradients and defend against gradient inversion attacks. Compatible with black-box scenarios.  

Main Contributions:
- First to systematically evaluate performance of PITs in FSL on CIFAR and Tiny ImageNet datasets under various heterogeneous splits.
- Propose FES-PIT to accelerate FSL training with PITs. Also propose FES-PTZO for model privacy via zeroth-order optimization.
- Show superior performance over SOTA baselines. FES-PTZO also protects model better while maintaining accuracy.
- Provide comprehensive analysis of convergence, accuracy tradeoffs for PIT-based FSL under different data heterogeneity settings.

In summary, the paper incorporates pre-trained image transformers into federated split learning to accelerate training and enhance model robustness against heterogeneous data distributions. Further privacy protections are provided via a zeroth-order optimization variant. Systematic experiments demonstrate superior performance over baselines.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes two federated split learning algorithms with pre-trained image transformers, FES-PIT and FES-PTZO, to improve performance and robustness against heterogeneous data while reducing resource overhead for edge devices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Incorporating pre-trained image transformers (PITs) into federated split learning (FSL) scenarios, called FES-PIT. 

2. Proposing FES-PTZO to enhance gradient information protection and have the capability compatible with black-box scenarios by utilizing zeroth-order (ZO) optimization.

3. Being the first to evaluate FSL performance with multiple PIT models in terms of model accuracy and convergence under various heterogeneous data distributions in many real-world datasets. 

4. Conducting comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets with various PITs under non-IID settings with different data partitions to systematically compare and evaluate the proposed methods.

In summary, the key contribution is using pre-trained image transformers in federated split learning and evaluating this systematically across different datasets and non-IID data partitions. The proposed FES-PTZO method also aims to improve privacy.
