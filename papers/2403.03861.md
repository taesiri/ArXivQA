# [Designing Informative Metrics for Few-Shot Example Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03861)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Pretrained language models (PLMs) show impressive few-shot learning capabilities when provided with properly formatted examples. However, selecting the "best" examples remains an open challenge.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a complexity-based prompt selection approach for sequence tagging tasks that avoids training a dedicated selection model.
- The approach uses sentence-level and word-level complexity metrics to match the syntactic and semantic complexity of examples to the test sentence. 
- The complexity score comprises of:
  - Normalized sentence similarity score
  - Normalized smoothed length similarity 
  - Normalized label entropy
- The complexity score is used to select the top-k scoring training sentences as prompts for the test sentence.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a complexity-based prompt retrieval (CP retrieval) approach that improves few-shot accuracy of PLMs on sequence tagging tasks by selecting informative examples
- Achieves state-of-the-art on few-shot NER with a 5% absolute improvement in F1 on CoNLL2003 dataset for GPT-4
- Shows consistent and significant gains across models and tasks compared to baseline prompting approaches, with largest gains of up to 28.85 points
- Provides a general quantification of example informativeness without needing extra computations or task-specific training

In summary, the paper presents an unsupervised approach for selecting effective examples for few-shot prompting of PLMs on sequence tagging tasks. By matching complexity of examples to test sentences, it extracts greater performance without fine-tuning model parameters.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a complexity-based prompt selection approach that uses sentence- and word-level metrics to match the syntactic and semantic complexity of examples to test sentences, achieving state-of-the-art few-shot sequence tagging performance on NER and significantly improving accuracy on other tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a complexity-based prompt selection approach for sequence tagging tasks. Specifically:

1) They propose CP retrieval to select prompts based on sentence and word level complexity metrics, including normalized sentence similarity, normalized smoothed length similarity, and normalized label entropy. 

2) They demonstrate improved few-shot accuracy with CP retrieval across several models and sequence tagging tasks like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and sentence chunking. Their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot NER on the CoNLL2003 dataset for GPT-4, with a 5% absolute improvement in F1 score.

So in summary, the key contribution is developing and evaluating a complexity-based method for selecting good prompt examples to enhance the few-shot learning capabilities of pretrained language models on sequence tagging tasks.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a complexity-based prompt selection approach. What are the key components of this proposed complexity score and what is the intuition behind using each of these components?

2. The complexity score uses both sentence-level and word-level metrics. Why is it important to consider complexity at both these levels for selecting good prompts? How do these different granularities provide complementary information?

3. What are some limitations of using nearest neighbors algorithms or similarity in the embedding space alone for selecting prompt examples as discussed in Section 2? How does the proposed approach overcome some of these limitations?

4. The paper demonstrates improved accuracy across several sequence tagging tasks. Based on the results, what inferences can you draw about how the gains using this approach vary with factors like model size, number of examples k, and choice of task?

5. The paper focuses on sequence tagging tasks. What properties of these tasks make a complexity-based selection approach feasible and reasonably effective? Would you expect similar gains using this method for more complex language generation tasks?

6. Could the complexity score be improved by incorporating additional components? What other linguistic properties could provide useful signal for assessing prompt complexity and informativeness?  

7. The weights for different components of the complexity score are set using grid search. What are some potential downsides of selecting weights in this manner? Are there other principled methods you would suggest to set these weights?

8. How demanding is it to implement this approach computationally for practical applications? What are some ways the efficiency of the selection process could be improved without sacrificing too much accuracy?

9. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art few-shot NER performance. To what extent could advances in example selection complement other sophisticated prompting techniques like chain-of-thought prompting?  

10. The variability in performance based on prompt examples is a key motivation behind selection approaches. From a cognitive science perspective, what theories could potentially explain why small changes in prompts can have such a significant impact on model performance?
