# [One-shot Implicit Animatable Avatars with Model-based Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02469)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 This paper addresses the challenge of creating realistic animatable 3D human avatars from readily available camera inputs like a single image. The central hypothesis is that by leveraging model-based priors like a 3D body shape geometry prior and a visual clothing semantic prior, it is possible to train an animatable neural radiance field (NeRF) representation from just a single image as input. Specifically, the two key hypotheses are:

1) A 3D body shape geometry prior from SMPL can provide constraints on body shape and pose to guide the model when geometry information is missing due to occlusions. 

2) A visual semantic prior from a pre-trained vision model like CLIP can hallucinate plausible details for occluded regions by enforcing semantic consistency between views.

The overall goal is to show that with these model-based priors, the proposed method called ELICIT can create realistic animatable avatars from single images without relying on large-scale training data like many existing methods. The experiments aim to demonstrate that ELICIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on tasks like novel view synthesis and novel pose synthesis when only a single image is available as input.

In summary, the paper aims to tackle the challenging problem of data-efficient avatar creation from monocular images by utilizing model-based priors to guide a one-shot learning process for optimizing an animatable implicit human representation. The key hypothesis is that these priors can compensate for the missing information in sparse single-image input and enable generating realistic free-view renderings.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. Proposing ELICIT, a novel method to learn an animatable neural radiance field from a single image without relying on extra training data. 

2. Using two effective model-based priors to achieve free-view rendering of a 3D avatar from a single image:

- A visual model-based semantic prior that leverages CLIP models to hallucinate unseen parts of the clothed body.

- A human shape prior from SMPL to provide geometric clues and constrain body poses.

3. A hybrid sampling strategy during training that includes:

- Body-part aware sampling to refine details of different body parts. 

- Rotation-aware sampling to better recover heavily occluded views.

4. Demonstrating superior performance to recent human-specific neural rendering baselines on the tasks of novel view synthesis and novel pose synthesis using only a single image input.

5. Showing strong qualitative results on in-the-wild human images, enabled by the model-based priors rather than reliance on training data.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting a way to create an animatable free-viewpoint avatar from just a single image, using model-based priors to avoid the need for subject-specific training data. The proposed method ELICIT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in the single image setting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to related work in the field:

- This paper proposes a novel method for learning animatable human radiance fields from a single image. Most prior work in human-specific neural rendering requires dense inputs like video or multi-view images. So this paper's goal of generating high-quality results from just one image is quite different.

- The key novelty is using model-based priors (SMPL geometry prior and CLIP semantic prior) to guide the optimization process and hallucinate plausible unseen regions. This is different from other single image methods like MonoNHR and EVA3D that rely on learned priors from large datasets. 

- Compared to data-driven methods like ARCH, PiFu, PaMIR, etc., this paper's model-based approach does not require training on human 3D scans. So it may generalize better to in-the-wild images.

- For human radiance field methods like Neural Body and Ani-NeRF, this paper shows superior performance in the sparse, single image setting by incorporating the proposed priors.

- Compared to generalizable radiance field methods like MPS-NeRF and NHP, this paper achieves better results by focusing specifically on modeling humans and using human-specific priors.

- The use of CLIP loss is similar to other CLIP-driven novel view synthesis works, but this paper is the first to apply it successfully to the task of human rendering from a single image.

Overall, the key differentiator of this paper is the model-based, training-free approach to single image novel view synthesis of humans. The proposed priors enable completion of invisible regions and realistic rendering without large-scale training data. The comparisons show quantitatively superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Enhancing the semantic prior with richer information like human parsing segmentation and view-aware text guidance. This could help improve the quality of synthesized back-side appearance. The authors mention integrating text-to-image models as a potential way to achieve this.

- Introducing additional supervision signals for the geometry, such as surface normals and depth maps. This could improve the quality of reconstructed geometry like faces, hands, and complex clothing. 

- Exploring more efficient human-specific NeRF representations to reduce GPU memory requirements and training time.

- Improving the robustness of the approach to work with imperfect SMPL pose estimates, which currently can cause artifacts.

- Enhancing the versatility of the framework to accept different input types like multiple images, short videos, or images with text descriptions.

- Trying alternative implicit human representations that have better surface quality and rendering efficiency compared to the current HumanNeRF model.

- Using a more expressive human body prior like SMPL-X to improve detailed hand and body geometry.

- Investigating image diffusion models as an alternative to CLIP for providing semantic guidance, since they have shown promise for text-to-3D generation.

In summary, the main future directions focus on 1) improving semantic/geometric guidance especially for things like clothing and hands, 2) increasing efficiency and robustness, and 3) enhancing input versatility and representation quality. The authors provide good suggestions on how emerging techniques like diffusion models, text-to-image GANs, and richer body models could help drive progress in these areas.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called ELICIT for learning human-specific neural radiance fields from a single image to create animatable 3D avatars. Unlike prior work that requires dense multi-view images/videos or leverages large 3D human datasets, ELICIT uses two model-based priors - SMPL geometry prior and CLIP visual semantic prior - to guide the optimization process and hallucinate plausible unseen regions. It initializes the radiance field using SMPL mesh renderings and constrains it with a silhouette loss. The CLIP embedding loss provides semantic supervision to generate consistent novel views. A hybrid sampling strategy further refines body part details. Experiments on ZJU-MoCAP, Human3.6M, and DeepFashion show ELICIT outperforms baseline methods like Neural Body, Animatable NeRF, and Neural Human Performer for novel view/pose synthesis from a single image, while also generalizing well to real-world photos. Core contributions are one-shot avatar creation from a single image using model priors rather than extra training data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method called ELICIT for learning human-specific neural radiance fields from a single image input. Most existing methods require dense inputs like video or multi-view images, or rely on large 3D human datasets to train conditional models that can reconstruct from sparse inputs. In contrast, ELICIT can generate realistic and animatable avatars using only a single image. 

The key ideas are leveraging two model-based priors to guide the optimization process: a visual clothing semantic prior using CLIP embeddings to hallucinate plausible unseen areas, and a human body shape prior from SMPL to constrain the geometry. ELICIT also uses a hybrid sampling strategy to refine details on body parts and avoid artifacts. Experiments show ELICIT outperforms recent methods on tasks like novel view and pose synthesis. It also generalizes well to real images. Main limitations are mirrored appearance, geometry quality, and texture projection errors. Overall, ELICIT enables creating animatable avatars from single images in a data-efficient way through carefully designed model-based priors.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes ELICIT, a novel approach to learn an animatable neural radiance field from a single image input of a person. The key idea is to leverage two model-based priors to guide the optimization process: a visual semantic prior using CLIP and a geometric prior using SMPL. Specifically, ELICIT first initializes a HumanNeRF model with multi-view SMPL mesh renderings to impart an approximate human shape and body part semantics. During training, the SMPL model provides a soft geometric constraint via a silhouette loss to maintain plausible poses and shape. Additionally, a CLIP-based semantic loss is used to hallucinate realistic appearance in occluded regions and enforce consistency across views. The paper also introduces a hybrid sampling strategy with body-part-aware sampling to refine details and rotation-aware sampling to recover occluded areas. Experiments on datasets like ZJU-MoCap, Human3.6M and DeepFashion demonstrate ELICIT's ability to generate high-quality animatable avatars from just a single image.
