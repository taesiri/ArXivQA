# [FedRDMA: Communication-Efficient Cross-Silo Federated LLM via Chunked   RDMA Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Communication overhead is a major bottleneck for cross-silo federated learning of large language models (FedLLM), even with high bandwidth networks. For example, transferring the GPT-2 model can take 45.9s per round, accounting for 44.97% of total FedLLM time.
- This stems from issues with TCP protocol like repeated memory copies, context switching, slow start, congestion control, etc. 
- RDMA can reduce communication overhead by up to 98.8% by directly transferring data between server memories, bypassing the CPU and kernel. However, it requires lossless networks and struggles on wide-area networks (WANs), falling into endless retransmissions.

Proposed Solution - FedRDMA:
- Splits large model update into smaller chunks and sends them sequentially over RDMA. This smooths traffic flow and prevents overwhelming WAN nodes.
- Further optimizations in FedRDMA-E: utilizes memory pools for in-place buffering, eliminates need for reassembly, reduces CPU and memory overhead.

Main Contributions:
- Conducted experiments showing high communication overhead in FedLLM even with high bandwidth. 
- Proposed FedRDMA for efficient RDMA-based communication by managing traffic flows through chunked transmission.
- Implemented atop industrial FedLLM framework FATE and achieved up to 3.8Ã— faster communication over TCP-based FedLLM.
- Showed seamless integration of FedRDMA with other optimizations like PEFT for even greater improvements.

In summary, the paper addresses the communication challenges for cross-silo FedLLM by proposing an RDMA-based solution FedRDMA that transmits model updates in chunks. Through implementation and experiments, FedRDMA demonstrates significantly reduced communication overhead and accelerated FedLLM convergence.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes FedRDMA, a communication-efficient cross-silo federated learning system that integrates RDMA into the FL communication protocol by dividing model updates into chunks and designing optimizations to improve the efficiency and robustness of RDMA-based communication over wide area networks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Conducting preliminary experiments to demonstrate that cross-silo FedLLM still suffers from high communication overhead, despite high bandwidth and computation resources.

2. Proposing FedRDMA, a communication-efficient cross-silo FedLLM system featuring chunked RDMA transmission and a series of optimizations to improve the efficiency and robustness of RDMA-based communication. 

3. Implementing FedRDMA atop an industrial FedLLM framework and evaluating it on a real-world cross-silo FL scenario. The experiments show FedRDMA can achieve up to 3.8x speedup in communication efficiency compared to traditional TCP/IP-based FL systems.

So in summary, the main contribution is proposing and implementing FedRDMA, an optimized RDMA-based communication system tailored for cross-silo FedLLM, and demonstrating its superiority over traditional TCP/IP-based communication.

The paper proposes a system called \sys to accelerate communication for cross-silo federated learning of large language models over wide-area networks. It does this by chunking model updates and transmitting them with RDMA in an optimized manner. Key aspects include addressing limitations of RDMA on WANs, integrating RDMA into the federated learning pipeline, and showing compatibility with techniques like PEFT and LORA for further optimizations.
