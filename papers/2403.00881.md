# [FedRDMA: Communication-Efficient Cross-Silo Federated LLM via Chunked   RDMA Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00881)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Communication overhead is a major bottleneck for cross-silo federated learning of large language models (FedLLM), even with high bandwidth networks. For example, transferring the GPT-2 model can take 45.9s per round, accounting for 44.97% of total FedLLM time.
- This stems from issues with TCP protocol like repeated memory copies, context switching, slow start, congestion control, etc. 
- RDMA can reduce communication overhead by up to 98.8% by directly transferring data between server memories, bypassing the CPU and kernel. However, it requires lossless networks and struggles on wide-area networks (WANs), falling into endless retransmissions.

Proposed Solution - FedRDMA:
- Splits large model update into smaller chunks and sends them sequentially over RDMA. This smooths traffic flow and prevents overwhelming WAN nodes.
- Further optimizations in FedRDMA-E: utilizes memory pools for in-place buffering, eliminates need for reassembly, reduces CPU and memory overhead.

Main Contributions:
- Conducted experiments showing high communication overhead in FedLLM even with high bandwidth. 
- Proposed FedRDMA for efficient RDMA-based communication by managing traffic flows through chunked transmission.
- Implemented atop industrial FedLLM framework FATE and achieved up to 3.8Ã— faster communication over TCP-based FedLLM.
- Showed seamless integration of FedRDMA with other optimizations like PEFT for even greater improvements.

In summary, the paper addresses the communication challenges for cross-silo FedLLM by proposing an RDMA-based solution FedRDMA that transmits model updates in chunks. Through implementation and experiments, FedRDMA demonstrates significantly reduced communication overhead and accelerated FedLLM convergence.
