# [How Language Model Hallucinations Can Snowball](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13534)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Do language models hallucinate incorrect claims not due to lack of knowledge, but rather to maintain consistency with previous hallucinations? In other words, do language models "snowball" hallucinations even when they have the capability to recognize those claims as false in isolation?

The key hypothesis is that language models are susceptible to a phenomenon the authors term "hallucination snowballing", where a language model makes an initial mistake or hallucination, and then continues generating more incorrect claims in an attempt to justify the initial mistake and maintain coherence/consistency. The authors hypothesize that this occurs even for simple factual claims that the model has the knowledge to recognize as false when presented alone, demonstrating that hallucinations are not solely due to knowledge gaps.

To test this hypothesis, the authors construct three QA datasets designed to elicit incorrect answers and justifications from the models, and then test whether the models can recognize the false claims made in the justifications when presented separately. The primality testing, senator search, and graph connectivity datasets are designed to probe this snowballing behavior.

So in summary, the central research question is whether LMs hallucinate not just due to lack of knowledge, but also a tendency to snowball even simple mistakes - a phenomenon the authors term "hallucination snowballing". The hypotheses and experiments center around demonstrating and quantifying this effect.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating the phenomenon of "hallucination snowballing" in large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4. The key points are:

- The paper shows that LMs often make incorrect claims not just due to lack of knowledge, but in order to remain consistent with an earlier mistake. 

- The authors construct 3 QA datasets where the LMs first state an incorrect answer, then justify it with an explanation containing false claims. Crucially, when presented alone, the LMs can identify those false claims as incorrect.

- This "hallucination snowballing" happens because LMs are trained to maintain coherence, so once they commit to a wrong answer, they continue generating false facts to support it. 

- The authors recommend modifications to prompting, decoding, and training strategies to reduce snowballing. The core problem is that conditioning on faulty context leads LMs to produce simple mistakes they otherwise wouldn't.

In summary, the key contribution is demonstrating and analyzing the specific phenomenon of hallucination snowballing, showing how consistency pressures cause LMs to compound early mistakes with further falsities. The authors provide insights into this failure mode and suggestions to mitigate it.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 often make incorrect claims to justify previously generated incorrect answers, even though they can identify those claims as wrong when presented in isolation - a phenomenon the authors call "hallucination snowballing".


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of studying hallucinations by large language models:

- The phenomenon of "hallucination snowballing" identified in this paper is novel. Prior work has studied hallucinations in LMs, but this paper specifically looks at cases where the LM produces a hallucination to justify an earlier incorrect claim, even though it can identify the justification as false in isolation. This "snowballing" behavior is a new observation.

- The paper introduces a systematic methodology for prompting LMs in a way that tends to induce these snowballing hallucinations, in order to study them. Constructing datasets centered around prime factorization, senator biography, and graph connectivity is a creative way to elicit this behavior. 

- The scope is limited to certain constrained QA tasks, and does not explore whether similar snowballing occurs in more open-ended text generation. Studying this phenomenon in a broader context remains an area for future work.

- The analysis relies heavily on proprietary models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 which limits reproducibility. At the same time, the capabilities of these models are state-of-the-art and not yet matched by publicly available models.

- The work is empirical in nature and focuses on observations from experiments. It does not probe theoretical explanations for why hallucination snowballing occurs. Connecting the empirical findings to transformer theory remains open.

Overall, this paper introduces a new problematic behavior of LMs through disciplined prompting. It remains very narrowly focused on simple QA though, and many open questions remain about the breadth of this phenomenon as well as its underlying causes. But it provides a basis for further research to build on.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Studying hallucination snowballing in other tasks beyond question answering, such as summarization or code generation. The authors hypothesize it may manifest more broadly in open-ended text generation.

- Testing the effect of beam search during decoding on reducing hallucination snowballing. The authors were unable to test this due to API limitations but suggest it as a potential mitigation approach.

- Training strategies to improve handling of the types of questions that lead to snowballing, such as increased emphasis on generating reasoning chains before conclusions or training on data that requires backtracking from incorrect answers.

- Developing new methods to enable language models to explicitly acknowledge and backtrack from initial mistakes rather than over-committing to flawed context. The authors observed limited examples of GPT-4 doing this already.

- Conducting experiments on a wider range of language models beyond ChatGPT and GPT-4. The proprietary nature of the models tested constrained the authors.

- Exploring the relationship between prompting strategies and snowballing in more depth, as the authors found evidence that prompts ameliorate but do not eliminate the issue.

In summary, the main future work revolves around better understanding, detecting, and preventing hallucination snowballing across different settings, models, and training paradigms. Developing techniques to recognize and recover from initial mistakes is highlighted as a promising direction.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 are susceptible to a phenomenon the authors call "hallucination snowballing." This refers to when a language model gives an incorrect answer to a question and then justifies it with additional incorrect claims, even though the model is able to identify those same claims as false when presented in isolation. To study this, the authors construct three question-answering datasets related to primality testing, senator biography, and graph connectivity. They find that both ChatGPT and GPT-4 frequently provide wrong answers followed by faulty explanations containing simple factual mistakes that the models themselves refute when prompted separately. This indicates the incorrect claims arise from an attempt at consistency with the initial mistake, not true gaps in knowledge. The authors hypothesize that hallucination snowballing results from models being trained to continue fluently, rather than revise initial errors. They suggest further research into techniques to encourage backtracking and acknowledgement of mistakes. Overall, the paper provides evidence that conditioning on an earlier mistake leads language models to produce false claims they otherwise wouldn't generate.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper demonstrates that large language models like ChatGPT and GPT-4 are susceptible to a phenomenon the authors call "hallucination snowballing". Hallucination snowballing refers to when a language model makes an initial mistake or hallucination, and then continues to make more mistakes in an attempt to justify the initial error. 

The authors construct three question answering datasets - on primality testing, US senator facts, and graph connectivity - where the models often provide an incorrect yes/no answer followed by faulty reasoning. However, when the incorrect claims made in the reasoning are presented back to the model in isolation, the model is usually able to recognize them as false. This suggests the initial mistakes propagate, rather than stemming from genuine knowledge gaps. While better prompting can reduce mistakes, hallucination snowballing still occurs and remains an issue. The authors conclude language models should be improved to acknowledge initial errors and revise their answers, rather than over-committing to an initial mistake.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The authors construct three question-answering datasets to probe the phenomenon of "hallucination snowballing" in language models: determining if a number is prime, whether there is a US senator with two specified attributes, and whether two cities are connected in a graph of flights. For each dataset, they first evaluate if ChatGPT and GPT-4 provide the correct yes/no answer to the question. When the model is incorrect, the authors extract the justification and ask the same model if that justification is valid on its own. They find that the models often recognize their own justification contains incorrect claims, even though they generated those claims to defend an initial mistake. This demonstrates "snowballing": the model makes an early error, realizes the need for justification, but then makes further errors in constructing that justification that it seems to know are invalid. The authors argue this occurs because models are simply trained to continue text coherently, rather than revise initial mistakes.
