# [Accelerating Search-Based Planning for Multi-Robot Manipulation by   Leveraging Online-Generated Experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00143)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Planning motions for multiple robotic arms collaborating on tasks like assembly and pick-and-place is challenging due to the high-dimensional composite configuration space. Popular multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms like Conflict-Based Search (CBS) rely on fast single-agent planning, an assumption that does not hold for robotic manipulation tasks where collision checking is expensive. This renders CBS computationally inefficient and limits its applicability to multi-arm robotic manipulation (M-RAMP).

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a method to accelerate CBS-based algorithms for M-RAMP by reusing online-generated path experiences from previous searches. The key idea is that consecutive single-agent planning queries in CBS are very similar, differing only by an additional constraint. So parts of the previous solution can be reused. 

The method has two components:
1) High-level search: Each node stores paths for each arm and constraints. When replanning for an arm, the previous path is passed as "experience" to the low-level planner.
2) Low-level planner (xWA*): Attempts to reuse as much of the experience path as possible by inserting experience states into the OPEN list while satisfying constraints. This provides a "warm start" and directs search closer to the goal faster.

The paper proves theoretically that the resulting algorithms (xCBS and xECBS) retain completeness and bounded sub-optimality guarantees of CBS and ECBS.

Contributions:
1) A novel framework to accelerate CBS-style algorithms for M-RAMP by reusing online-generated experiences.
2) Theoretical analysis showing completeness and sub-optimality bounds are preserved.  
3) Empirical evaluation on tasks with up to 10 arms showing higher success rates and lower planning times compared to prior MAPF and M-RAMP algorithms.

The proposed acceleration makes CBS-based approaches practical for complex multi-arm coordination tasks by effectively reusing previous search efforts.
