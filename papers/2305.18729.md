# [Real-World Image Variation by Aligning Diffusion Inversion Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18729)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key research question this paper aims to address is: How can we generate high-quality and diverse variations of a given real-world image while preserving its semantic content and visual characteristics?The paper proposes a novel approach called RIVAL that utilizes diffusion models to generate image variations from a single image exemplar. The key innovation is aligning the image generation process with the real-image inversion chain to reduce the domain gap between generated and real images. Specifically, the paper identifies that a mismatch exists between the latent distributions of the vanilla image generation chain and real-image inversion chain in diffusion models. To address this, RIVAL introduces two main techniques:1) Cross-image self-attention injection to enable interaction between the hidden states of the real-image inversion chain and the generation chain. 2) Step-wise latent normalization to align the latent features of the generation chain with the inverted latent of the real image exemplar.By incorporating these alignment techniques into the diffusion model's sampling process, RIVAL is able to generate high-fidelity and diverse image variations that preserve semantic and style similarity with the input real-world image.The key hypothesis is that aligning the latent distributions of the generation and inversion chains will allow diffusion models to capture important style and content features from real-world images more effectively for variation generation. The paper provides both qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the superiority of RIVAL over existing approaches.
