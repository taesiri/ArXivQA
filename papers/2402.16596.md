# [Semantic change detection for Slovene language: a novel dataset and an   approach based on optimal transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16596)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Detecting semantic changes in words over time provides insights into language evolution, but requires manually labeled datasets for evaluation. Such datasets are scarce, especially for low-resourced languages like Slovene.
- Existing semantic change detection systems have not been evaluated for Slovene due to the lack of an evaluation dataset.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors create the first manually annotated semantic change detection dataset for Slovene, covering 104 target words over two time periods (1990-1997 and 2018) with over 3000 annotated sentence pairs.
- They propose a novel unsupervised semantic change detection method based on optimal transport that does not require explicit clustering of embeddings.

Main Contributions:
- First manually labeled semantic change detection gold standard for Slovene language
- Dataset contains aggregated semantic change scores for 104 words over 3020 annotated sentence pairs 
- A novel semantic change detection method using optimal transport that outperforms existing state-of-the-art systems by 22.8% error reduction
- Comparative evaluation of multiple semantic change detection methods on the new Slovene dataset
- Analysis of the constructed dataset, annotation effort, and resulting quality

The paper makes good progress towards semantic change detection for Slovene by providing the first evaluation dataset and showing the promise of optimal transport methods. The analysis also reveals interesting linguistic insights like changes relating to new technologies. Overall, this is a useful contribution for the low-resourced Slovene language and advances the state-of-the-art in semantic change detection.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents the first Slovene dataset for evaluating semantic change detection systems, proposes a novel unsupervised approach using optimal transport that outperforms existing methods, and provides an analysis of the dataset creation, annotation process, and evaluation experiments.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) The construction of the first manually labeled gold standard semantic change detection dataset for Slovene, a low-resourced Slavic language with about two million speakers.

2) A novel unsupervised semantic change detection system based on optimal transport that outperforms three state-of-the-art embedding-based semantic change detection systems on the new dataset.

3) The first comparative evaluation of multiple semantic change detection systems in Slovene. 

4) A thorough analysis of the constructed dataset, the annotation effort and the resulting annotations.

In summary, the key contribution is the creation and evaluation of the first semantic change detection dataset for Slovene to enable further research on this topic for a less-resourced language. Additionally, a new optimal transport-based approach is proposed that shows promising performance for semantic change detection.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel unsupervised semantic change detection system based on optimal transport. How exactly does this method work? Can you explain the steps in detail, especially how the cost matrix is constructed and how optimal transport is applied?

2. Instead of using clustering like previous methods, this paper gives equal weight to each usage example. What is the rationale behind avoiding the clustering step? What limitations does clustering have that makes avoiding it beneficial?

3. The paper questions the choice of using the embedding from the final hidden layer for semantic change detection. What evidence does it provide to justify using the second-to-last hidden layer instead? How do the vector norms change across layers?

4. Figure 2 shows the performance of the proposed method at different layers. Why does using only the final layer perform worse than other layers? Why does including the final layer in the averaged representation not significantly influence performance?

5. The paper states that solving many optimal transport problems is too slow for corpus-level analysis. What suggestions does it provide for speeding up the approach to make it scalable? What other techniques could be explored? 

6. This paper evaluates on a new Slovene dataset. How was this dataset constructed? What are its key statistics and features compared to datasets in other languages? What limitations does it have?

7. The paper finds better performance for contextual embedding models compared to static embedding models, unlike some prior work. What reasons does it suggest for this difference? How could this be analyzed further?

8. How exactly is the cosine distance used in the paper? Walk through the math showing how it is incorporated into the optimal transport formulation. Are there any other distance measures that could be substituted?

9. The Spearman rank correlation is used as the evaluation metric in this work. What are some pros and cons of using rank correlation versus other metrics for evaluating semantic change systems?

10. The paper proposes some interesting future work ideas. Which of those seem the most promising or impactful to you? What other extensions or open questions remain about this optimal transport approach?
