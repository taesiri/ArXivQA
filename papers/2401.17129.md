# [Enhanced Sound Event Localization and Detection in Real 360-degree   audio-visual soundscapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17129)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sound event localization and detection (SELD) aims to detect active sound classes and estimate their direction of arrival (DoA). 
- Audio-visual SELD can be more robust than audio-only, but most audio-visual models don't estimate physical DoA and depend too much on visual content.
- The audio-visual SELDnet23 baseline has limited performance due to scarce training data and limitations in its visual branch.

Proposed Solution:
- Implement audio-visual data augmentation using channel and pixel swapping to increase training data.
- Build an audio-visual synthetic data generator using spatial room impulses and YouTube video overlays.  
- Enhance audio-visual SELDnet by replacing baseline object detector with more advanced ones like YOLO and DETIC to better exploit visual information.

Contributions:
- Audio-visual data augmentation and synthetic data generation implementations.
- Audio-visual SELD systems with advanced object detectors that outperform baselines:
  - YOLO-based systems leverage COCO classes and fixed vocabulary.
  - DETIC-based system uses large customizable vocabulary tailored to dataset classes.
- Proposed methods enhance performance over baselines on sound event localization error and other SELD metrics.

In summary, the paper presents an enhanced audio-visual SELD framework with data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and architectural improvements to effectively fuse visual information, outperforming baseline methods on the SELD task.
