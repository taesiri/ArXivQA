# [Deciphering Digital Detectives: Understanding LLM Behaviors and   Capabilities in Multi-Agent Mystery Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00746)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality one-paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper explores using large language models (LLMs) as agents in Chinese murder mystery role-playing games called "Jubensha." The authors create the first dataset tailored for Jubensha AI research, comprising over 1,100 game records. They also design a multi-agent framework where LLM-based agents can autonomously play Jubensha games via natural language interactions. To evaluate these AI agents, specialized methods are introduced targeting their mastery of case details and reasoning abilities. Additionally, the latest advancements in in-context learning are incorporated to enhance the agents' performance on critical tasks like information gathering, detective work, and logical reasoning. Experiments validate that the proposed interaction framework and in-context learning modules significantly improve the agents' capabilities. Overall, this work establishes a new benchmark for assessing LLM-based agents in complex, adversarial narrative environments constrained by plot contexts. It offers valuable insights into understanding LLM capacities.
