# [How Does Selection Leak Privacy: Revisiting Private Selection and   Improved Results for Hyper-parameter Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13087)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the privacy implications and costs of hyperparameter tuning in differentially private machine learning. Specifically, it examines whether the current state-of-the-art privacy analysis for private hyperparameter tuning protocols is tight. The paper notes that while generic analysis provides tight bounds, analysis tailored to tuning differentially private SGD may reveal lower privacy costs.  

Contributions:

1) Validates tightness of generic privacy bounds for private selection in general worst case. Constructs example where bound is nearly tight.

2) Empirically investigates privacy leakage of current private tuning protocol under various threat models via audits:
- Weakest audit reveals tuner hardly leaks privacy beyond base algorithm in practical settings
- Strongest audit confirms noticeable leakage, but empirical privacy bound still exhibits gap from theoretical bound  

3) Provides improved privacy analysis specifically for tuning differentially private SGD by considering properties of DP-SGD. Shows empirically that bound is nearly tight and offers substantial gains over generic bound.

4) Analysis and results are more generalizable than prior work focused on specific tuning time distributions.

Key Findings:
- Validates usage of generic bounds for general private selection problems
- But shows better custom analysis is possible by opening the "blackbox" and considering properties of base algorithm (DP-SGD)
- Quantifies scenarios where tuning procedure leaks little additional privacy beyond single execution of base algorithm   
- Overall, demonstrates the privacy-utility tradeoff for tuning can be better understood through more nuanced, custom analysis compared to application of generic bounds

The paper makes both empirical and analytical contributions towards elucidating the privacy guarantees for an important procedure in differentially private ML.
