# [USTHB at NADI 2023 shared task: Exploring Preprocessing and Feature   Engineering Strategies for Arabic Dialect Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10536)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper explores various preprocessing techniques, feature engineering strategies, and classification models for the task of closed country-level Arabic dialect identification, as part of the NADI 2023 shared task. The goal is to accurately identify the country-level dialect of a given Arabic text.

Proposed Solution:  
The authors propose a system with four main components:

1. Surface preprocessing: Normalizing Arabic letters, removing punctuation/emojis/stopwords, eliminating diacritics.

2. Morphological preprocessing: Lemmatization and stemming to simplify word forms.  

3. Feature extraction: Using TF-IDF with varying n-grams and FastText in supervised and unsupervised modes to extract features.

4. Weighted feature fusion: Weighted concatenation of TF-IDF features from word, char and char_wb analyzers.  

They experiment with four configurations involving different combinations of these components. Classification is done using Linear SVC.

Key Findings:
The key findings are:

- Weighted fusion of TF-IDF features + FastText (Exp 4) gives the best F1 score of 62.84%. 

- Preprocessing causes a significant drop in performance compared to using vectorization alone. This indicates potential information loss.

- Supervised FastText outperforms unsupervised FastText and TF-IDF, achieving 61.24% F1 score.

- Their best system achieves 62.51% F1 score, which is comparable to the average 72.91% F1 score of other submitted systems.

Main Contributions:  
The main contributions are a systematic evaluation of the impact of preprocessing techniques, examination of supervised vs unsupervised FastText models, and demonstrating the effectiveness of weighted fusion of TF-IDF features for Arabic dialect identification. The paper provides valuable insights into optimal configurations for this task.
