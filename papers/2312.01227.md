# [Distributed Bayesian Estimation in Sensor Networks: Consensus on   Marginal Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01227)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper addresses the problem of distributed Bayesian estimation in sensor networks where each sensor node collects data that depends only on a subset of the variables of interest. This allows for reduced storage and communication requirements compared to nodes estimating the full set of variables. However, it introduces challenges in terms of achieving consensus on the estimates for common variables between neighboring nodes.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes distributed algorithms based on stochastic mirror descent that allow nodes to estimate marginal probability densities over their subset of relevant variables. The key ideas are:

1) Formulate a distributed estimation objective that is separable across nodes based on their local likelihoods. 

2) Apply stochastic mirror descent at each node using communication with neighbors to enforce consensus. This involves a mixing step to agree on common variables and a local Bayesian update.

3) Analyze the convergence by studying the relative change in estimates after the mixing step and providing summable upper bounds on differences across iterations.

4) Extend the algorithm to estimate only marginals relevant to each node while adding constraints to match marginals between neighbors on common variables.


Main Contributions:

1) A distributed Bayesian density estimation algorithm for continuous spaces that provably achieves asymptotic consensus on marginal densities at each node.

2) Convergence analysis in the functional space of probability density functions, showing almost sure convergence.

3) An extension for distributed marginal density estimation that significantly reduces storage and communication costs by having nodes estimate only locally relevant variables.

4) Convergence guarantees for the marginal density algorithm under an independence assumption and for Gaussian densities.

5) An application to distributed mapping using marginal Gaussian estimation and variational inference to handle non-linear observation models.
