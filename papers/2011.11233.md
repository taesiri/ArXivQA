# [ROME: Robustifying Memory-Efficient NAS via Topology Disentanglement and   Gradient Accumulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11233)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions seem to be:

1. Identifying and analyzing the performance collapse issue in single-path differentiable NAS methods like GDAS. The paper shows both empirically and theoretically that these methods suffer from similar instability issues as the original DARTS, where the architectures tend to be dominated by parameter-free operations like skip connections. 

2. Proposing a new robust NAS algorithm called ROME (Robustifying Memory-Efficient NAS) to address the instability. The key ideas are:

(a) Disentangling the search for topology and operations to make the search and evaluation stages more consistent. 

(b) Using gradient accumulation techniques to reduce the variance and enable more fair training of the operations.

3. Extensive experiments showing ROME achieves state-of-the-art performance across 15 NAS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness compared to prior NAS methods.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that single-path NAS methods also suffer from instability/collapse issues, which the authors diagnose as being due to topology inconsistency and insufficient sampling of operations. The proposed ROME algorithm aims to address these issues, leading to more robust and better performing architectures.
