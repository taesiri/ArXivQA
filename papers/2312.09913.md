# [LAENeRF: Local Appearance Editing for Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09913)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) enable high-quality novel view synthesis of 3D scenes, but editing their appearance remains challenging due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry in the model. 
- Existing works have limitations in interactivity, lack of support for local edits, high memory requirements, and inability to simultaneously perform photorealistic recoloring and non-photorealistic stylization.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes LAENeRF, a unified framework for interactive photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs.
- It uses a voxel grid for region selection and learns a mapping from estimated ray terminations to output colors for the selected region. 
- The mapping is parameterized as a palette-based decomposition with barycentric weights and offsets predicted by MLPs.
- The palette can be supervised by a style loss for stylization or optimized for reconstruction to enable recoloring.
- Smooth transitions are modeled to content adjacent to the selection using distance-based palette interpolation.

Contributions:
1) Unifies photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing for NeRFs into a single framework.
2) Enables interactive, recolorable stylization of local NeRF regions for the first time.
3) Proposes a geometry-aware 3D stylization architecture and losses to respect scene structure.

The approach is shown to enable detailed appearance edits not possible with prior works, while being fast, memory-efficient, and outperforming state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for recoloring and stylization tasks.
