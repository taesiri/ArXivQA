# [Linking Vision and Multi-Agent Communication through Visible Light   Communication using Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05619)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Identifying and enabling communication between identical agents (e.g. mass-produced robots) is challenging. Visual tags like AR markers have limitations with moving agents. Radio communication cannot distinguish between visually identical agents.  

Proposed Solution: 
- Use visible light communication (VLC) with event cameras which have high temporal resolution. The event cameras can detect LED signals and the location in the image, linking communication with visual information.

Contributions:

1) Showed event-camera VLC has advantages over other VLC methods for range, robustness and separating signals from multiple agents.  

2) Implemented a standalone event-camera VLC system and showed superior performance to RGB camera + AR marker system for distance, occlusion tolerance and motion blur.

3) Simulations showed that in cases where agents cannot visually identify each other, event-camera VLC performs equal or better than radio communication for coordination.  

4) Built a real multi-agent system with event cameras and LED transmitters. Showed they can achieve coordinated behavior and a 99.1% communication success rate, better than using photodiodes.

In summary, the paper proposes using event-camera visible light communication to enable robust identification and coordinated actions for visually identical multi-agent systems. Both simulations and real-world experiments validate the advantages over alternative communication and identification methods.
