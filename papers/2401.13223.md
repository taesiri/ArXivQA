# [TAT-LLM: A Specialized Language Model for Discrete Reasoning over   Tabular and Textual Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13223)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper focuses on question answering (QA) over documents containing both tabular data (e.g. tables) and accompanying text, such as financial reports. These types of documents require complex reasoning - arithmetic calculations, comparisons, counting etc. - to answer questions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have shown strong reasoning abilities, so the authors explore using them for this QA task. However, utilizing large online LLMs has downsides around cost, latency and privacy. 

Proposed Solution: 
The authors propose a "Step-wise Pipeline" for the QA task with 3 key steps:
1) Extractor: Identifies relevant numerical values from the table/text as evidence to answer the question
2) Reasoner: Generates an equation or logic rule using the extracted evidence to derive the answer 
3) Executor: Calculates the final answer by executing the equation/logic

They show that with a properly designed instruction, GPT-4 performs very well on this pipeline, outperforming prior specialized QA models. However, to mitigate the issues around using large general LLMs, the authors develop "TAT-LLM", which specializes a smaller LLM called LLaMA 2 using this pipeline.

Specifically, they fine-tune LLaMA 2 on automatic transformations of existing QA datasets to follow the pipeline. The model outputs are formatted into a structured table tracking each step. An "External Executor" module is added to ensure accurate execution.

Contributions:
- Abstracts a "Step-wise Pipeline" for tabular+textual QA that brings interpretability and shows strong performance when instantiated in GPT-4
- Develops TAT-LLM by specializing LLaMA 2 for this pipeline, demonstrating specialized smaller LM can outperform even very large general LM like GPT-4
- Extensive experiments on 3 QA datasets validate superiority over previous models and analysis provides insights into model performance w.r.t. different question types.

The paper illustrates the promise of specialized smaller LMs competitive with state-of-the-art general LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a specialized language model called TAT-LLM for question answering over tabular and textual data by fine-tuning LLaMA 2 following a step-wise pipeline of information extraction, logical reasoning, and answer execution, which outperforms state-of-the-art models including very large language models like GPT-4.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. It abstracts a Step-wise Pipeline including Extractor, Reasoner and Executor for better discrete reasoning capabilities in question answering over tabular and textual data, and shows the potential of grounding this pipeline on large language models.

2. It develops a TAT-LLM model by fine-tuning the LLaMA model using the Step-wise Pipeline and training data automatically transformed from existing QA datasets. This allows specializing smaller language models for tabular and textual QA to achieve better performance and practical usage compared to very large models.  

3. It conducts extensive experiments on three QA benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed TAT-LLM model over both conventional methods and very large models like GPT-4. The experiments also reveal more properties of the method such as the scaling law of language models on this task.

In summary, the main contributions are: proposing the Step-wise Pipeline, developing the specialized TAT-LLM model, and comprehensive empirical verification of the effectiveness and properties of the method.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a "Step-wise Pipeline" for tabular and textual QA consisting of Extractor, Reasoner, and Executor modules. How is this pipeline different from an end-to-end QA approach? What are the benefits of having intermediate outputs from each module?

2. The TAT-LLM model is trained by fine-tuning the LLaMA model using automatic transformations of existing QA dataset examples to match the Step-wise Pipeline format. What are some key considerations in designing the training data transformation? How could the quality of the transformed examples impact model performance?  

3. The paper shows significantly better performance by TAT-LLM compared to very large models like GPT-4. What aspects of the Step-wise Pipeline and specialization using financial QA datasets enable the smaller TAT-LLM model to outperform GPT-4?

4. Error analysis in Table 5 shows higher error rates in the Extractor module compared to the Reasoner. What techniques could help improve the extraction accuracy? For example, using an entity linking model before extraction.

5. The External Executor module refines the output of the base TAT-LLM model by executing equations and logic rules reliably. How essential is this module? Does its importance reduce with increase in model size?

6. The Step-wise Pipeline produces intermediate outputs. How can these outputs be leveraged for interpretability and debugging errors? For example, inspecting the extracted evidence and equations.

7. What are the practical challenges in deploying large foundation models like GPT-4 compared to specialized smaller models like TAT-LLM?

8. How suitable is the Step-wise Pipeline for tackling more complex QA tasks? Would the performance gains hold for multi-hop and compositional reasoning? 

9. The model struggles with unique financial terminology as per the error analysis. What techniques can address this vocabulary gap? Pre-training on in-domain corpora?

10. Can the Step-wise Pipeline approach be extended to other domain-specific QA datasets such as scientific, medical, legal documents? What adaptations would be required?
