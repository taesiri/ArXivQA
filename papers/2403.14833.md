# [Model order reduction of deep structured state-space models: A   system-theoretic approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14833)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Deep structured state-space models (SSMs) like the deep Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) architecture have recently emerged as powerful models for time series modeling. 
- However, the learned representations often have excessively large model orders (number of states), making them unsuitable for control design and other downstream tasks. 
- Existing model order reduction (MOR) techniques designed for linear systems cannot be directly applied for reducing the model complexity of learned deep SSMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce two regularization strategies during the training of deep SSMs to promote learning parsimonious models:
    - Modal L1 regularization: Penalizes magnitude of LRU eigenvalues to push some modes to 0.
    - Hankel nuclear norm regularization: Penalizes Hankel singular values to reduce model order.
- Apply MOR techniques like balanced/modal truncation and singular perturbation after training on the regularized deep SSMs.
- Show that regularization during training significantly improves effectiveness of subsequent MOR.

Key Contributions:
- First application of system-theoretic MOR techniques to reduce model complexity of learned deep SSM architectures. 
- Introduction of two computationally cheap regularizers that can be incorporated into training loss of deep SSMs to enable learning of parsimonious models.
- Demonstration on real-world aircraft vibration modeling task that regularization-enabled MOR leads to interpretable low-order deep SSMs without sacrificing accuracy.
- Analysis of different combinations of regularizers and MOR techniques to provide guidelines for achieving maximal complexity reduction.
- Open-source implementation of proposed techniques.

In summary, the paper introduces an effective framework to simplify complex learned deep SSMs using ideas from control theory and system identification, with applications in developing concise models for control design.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes regularized training and model order reduction techniques to obtain parsimonious deep structured state-space models for system identification.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing regularization techniques and model order reduction approaches to simplify deep structured state-space models (SSMs). Specifically:

- They introduce two regularization terms - modal $\ell_1$ and Hankel nuclear norm regularization - that can be incorporated into the training loss to promote learning of parsimonious SSM representations with fewer states. These leverage system-theoretic model order reduction techniques.

- They demonstrate the effective adaptation of traditional model order reduction (MOR) techniques like balanced truncation and singular perturbation, designed for linear systems, to reduce the order of the linear dynamical blocks of deep SSMs after training. 

- They show on a real-world aircraft vibration modeling example that regularization during training significantly increases the effectiveness of subsequent MOR methods in simplifying deep SSMs while maintaining predictive accuracy. The best performance is achieved by specific combinations of regularizers and MOR techniques.

In summary, the key contribution is a methodology to obtain simplified deep SSMs by integrating system-theoretic concepts into the machine learning pipeline, outperforming MOR techniques applied in a standalone manner after standard training.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the model order reduction method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using modal $\ell_1$ regularization to push some of the eigenvalues of the linear dynamical blocks towards zero during training. How does this promotion of sparsity in the eigenvalues help in subsequent model order reduction? What are the limitations of this approach?

2. The Hankel nuclear norm is used as a convex surrogate for the rank of the Hankel operator. Explain the connection between the Hankel operator's rank and the minimum realization order of a linear dynamical system. Why is reducing the rank beneficial for model order reduction?

3. The paper shows computationally efficient ways to calculate the Hankel singular values for systems in modal form. Walk through the mathematical derivations in Appendix A and explain how solving a diagonal Lyapunov equation is exploited here.

4. Balanced truncation and balanced singular perturbation model order reduction methods rely on the system being in a balanced realization. Explain the extra steps required to apply these techniques to the Linear Recurrent Units since they are parameterized in modal form.

5. The results show that regularization during training significantly improves the effectiveness of subsequent model order reduction. Analyze reasons why this could be the case from both a theoretical and practical perspective.

6. The choice of hyperparameter Î³ for controlling the regularization strength during training seems to be set heuristically. Propose some systematic approaches for tuning this hyperparameter, backed by theory and experimentation. 

7. The paper evaluates modal and balanced model order reduction techniques. Suggest some other viable alternatives and discuss their potential advantages and suitability for this application.

8. The model order reduction process focuses only on the linear dynamical blocks. Propose ways to reduce the complexity of other components of the overall deep architecture.

9. The results demonstrate the method only on a single case study. What other experiments could strengthen the conclusions regarding the viability of this model order reduction framework?

10. The paper claims the presented approach leads to advantages in terms of parsimonious representations and faster inference. Quantitatively analyze these benefits using metrics like number of parameters, floating point operations, and wall-clock inference time.
