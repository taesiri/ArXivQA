# [Prompting LLMs with content plans to enhance the summarization of   scientific articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Summarizing scientific articles is challenging due to their length and complexity. Current state-of-the-art abstractive summarizers struggle with this genre.
- Scientific papers have highly variable structure and complex technical language, posing difficulties for systems to adapt.
- Prior approaches relying on predicting key entities upfront for prompts have proven difficult for long technical documents. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes novel prompting techniques to enhance scientific article summarizers by providing informative contextual guidance through lists of salient terms. 
- Several unsupervised term extraction methods are conceived to obtain prompts, including author keywords, automatically extracted keywords (KeyBERT), and statistical measures like TF and TF-IDF.
- Prompts are designed to be easily integrated without needing additional complex models, unlike prior entity prompting approaches.

Experiments and Results:
- Various state-of-the-art transformer models are tested with and without prompts on a PubMed biomedical summarization dataset.
- Smaller models show significant gains from prompts when summarizing sections, increasing ROUGE scores up to 0.4. Confusion testing reveals reliance on relevant prompts.
- Prompting provides consistent but smaller gains for larger models and on introduction+discussion text. No single best performing prompting technique is found.  
- The paper demonstrates decoder prompting can meaningfully enhance smaller summarizers to address their limitations. This could enable quality lightweight models for resource-constrained contexts.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a new general prompting paradigm to upgrade scientific summarizers without extensive re-engineering.
- Analysis of prompting techniques across models, text inputs and confusion testing reveals particular utility for smaller models.
- Demonstration that prompting can compensate for fundamental deficiencies of smaller models, presenting an alternative to solely bigger architectures.
- Establishment of a promising new direction of research on employing prompts to enhance summarization systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents and evaluates novel techniques for providing summarization models, especially smaller ones, with informative key term prompts to help focus them on salient concepts and improve their summarization quality, with results showing consistent gains particularly for section-level summarization.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing novel prompting techniques to provide key term context and enhance scientific literature summarizers. The prompting techniques extract salient terms from the input texts using unsupervised methods to guide the summarizers.

2) Evaluating the prompting techniques with various state-of-the-art transformer-based summarization models, different model sizes and attention mechanisms, and different input text configurations (introduction + discussion vs separate sections). 

3) Demonstrating consistent performance improvements from prompting techniques, especially for smaller summarization models and when summarizing sections separately. This shows prompting can help address limitations of smaller models.

4) Introducing prompting as an easily adoptable technique to upgrade base summarizer implementations without extensive re-engineering. The results reveal decoder prompting as a promising direction for enhancing summarization.

In summary, the main contribution is conceiving, implementing and evaluating a set of prompting techniques to provide contextual guidance to transformer-based scientific literature summarizers, with a focus on demonstrating particular utility to assist smaller models.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes several different techniques for generating prompts to provide contextual information to summarization models. Can you explain in detail the prompting techniques that were conceived and how they work to generate informative prompts? 

2. Why did the authors hypothesize that prompts may provide greater gains when summarizing sections independently compared to summarizing the full introduction and discussion texts? Explain the rationale behind this hypothesis.

3. The paper tests the proposed prompting techniques on several state-of-the-art transformer-based summarization models. Can you list these models and describe in detail the differences between them in terms of size, attention mechanisms, and base architectures?

4. What were the main findings from the experiments regarding how effectiveness of prompting techniques varied across different models and input text types? Discuss any apparent interactions found between prompts and models.  

5. What evidence was provided to suggest that smaller models actively exploited and relied on informative prompts more compared to larger models? Explain the analysis done and results showing this.

6. Why do you think the ETC attention mechanism outperformed the sliding window attention when using prompts? Discuss the properties of ETC attention that might account for its better prompt utilization.  

7. Can you explain the confusion testing done in the experiments and how those results provided further evidence that smaller models leverage supplied prompt terms?

8. What are some high level implications and conclusions that can be derived from the overall experimental findings regarding the utility of prompting techniques?

9. The paper discusses several promising opportunities and directions for future work building on the introduced prompting techniques. Can you detail 2-3 of these proposed ideas for extending this research?
