# [Prompting LLMs with content plans to enhance the summarization of   scientific articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08282)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces and evaluates novel prompting techniques to enhance transformer-based models for summarizing scientific articles. The authors propose providing summarization systems with lists of salient terms extracted from input texts as prompts to help focus models on key concepts to include in generated summaries. They test five prompting methods, including author keywords and automatically extracted keywords using KeyBERT. Experiments analyze the impact of prompts on various state-of-the-art summarizers, including LongT5, LED, and BigBird-Pegasus variants, as well as different input texts - concatenation of introduction and discussion versus individual sections. Results demonstrate that prompting yields consistent gains in standard evaluation metrics, especially for smaller models summarizing sections separately. Performance improvements are more modest for large models. Further analysis reveals that smaller models actively exploit prompts, while large models rely more on internal learned representations. The central implication is that decoder prompting offers a practical means to address limitations of smaller summarizers in resource-constrained contexts. Rather than exclusively bigger models, compact prompted models may suffice where computational resources are limited. Overall, the work introduces prompting as a general technique to meaningfully upgrade summarizers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes and evaluates novel prompting techniques that provide summarization models, especially smaller ones, with informative key term prompts to improve their performance in summarizing scientific articles, particularly when summarizing sections independently.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1) Proposing novel prompting techniques to provide key term context and enhance scientific literature summarizers. Specifically, feeding summarizers with lists of key terms extracted from articles using various unsupervised methods. 

2) Performing extensive experiments on combinations of various state-of-the-art models and input text types, analyzing factors impacting prompt effectiveness.

3) Showing enhanced performance when employing prompts for smaller summarization models, particularly for section-level summarization. This highlights the potential of prompting as a technique to assist smaller models in resource-constrained contexts.

4) Introducing prompting as a general technique to meaningfully enhance small neural network summarizers. Rather than solely focusing on bigger models, smaller prompted models may suffice in some real-world applications.

In summary, the main contribution is introducing and evaluating decoder prompting as an effective way to improve scientific summarizers, especially lightweight models summarizing individual sections. Prompting provides a practical means to address limitations of small models for environments with computational constraints.
