# [Prompting LLMs with content plans to enhance the summarization of   scientific articles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08282)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Summarizing scientific articles is challenging due to their length and complexity. Current state-of-the-art abstractive summarizers struggle with this genre.
- Scientific papers have highly variable structure and complex technical language, posing difficulties for systems to adapt.
- Prior approaches relying on predicting key entities upfront for prompts have proven difficult for long technical documents. 

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper proposes novel prompting techniques to enhance scientific article summarizers by providing informative contextual guidance through lists of salient terms. 
- Several unsupervised term extraction methods are conceived to obtain prompts, including author keywords, automatically extracted keywords (KeyBERT), and statistical measures like TF and TF-IDF.
- Prompts are designed to be easily integrated without needing additional complex models, unlike prior entity prompting approaches.

Experiments and Results:
- Various state-of-the-art transformer models are tested with and without prompts on a PubMed biomedical summarization dataset.
- Smaller models show significant gains from prompts when summarizing sections, increasing ROUGE scores up to 0.4. Confusion testing reveals reliance on relevant prompts.
- Prompting provides consistent but smaller gains for larger models and on introduction+discussion text. No single best performing prompting technique is found.  
- The paper demonstrates decoder prompting can meaningfully enhance smaller summarizers to address their limitations. This could enable quality lightweight models for resource-constrained contexts.

Main Contributions:
- Introduction of a new general prompting paradigm to upgrade scientific summarizers without extensive re-engineering.
- Analysis of prompting techniques across models, text inputs and confusion testing reveals particular utility for smaller models.
- Demonstration that prompting can compensate for fundamental deficiencies of smaller models, presenting an alternative to solely bigger architectures.
- Establishment of a promising new direction of research on employing prompts to enhance summarization systems.
