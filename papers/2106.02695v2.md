# [Meta-Learning with Fewer Tasks through Task Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02695v2)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we improve the generalization performance of meta-learning algorithms, especially when the number of meta-training tasks is limited?The key hypothesis proposed is that generating additional tasks by interpolating between existing meta-training tasks can regularize meta-learning algorithms and improve their ability to generalize to new tasks drawn from a similar distribution. In particular, the paper proposes a new framework called MLTI (Meta-Learning with Task Interpolation) that generates new tasks by linearly interpolating between pairs of randomly sampled meta-training tasks. This interpolation can be done in different ways depending on whether the tasks share label spaces (label-sharing scenario) or have different label spaces (non-label-sharing scenario). The central hypothesis is that by effectively densifying the task distribution through interpolation, MLTI will impose an implicit regularization on meta-learning algorithms and reduce overfitting, leading to better generalization even when the original set of meta-training tasks is limited or sparse.In summary, the key research question is how to improve meta-learning generalization with limited tasks, and the central hypothesis is that the proposed MLTI framework can achieve this by interpolating between tasks to regularize meta-learning algorithms. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated theoretically and empirically in the paper.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new task augmentation method called MLTI (Meta-Learning with Task Interpolation) to improve the generalization ability of meta-learning algorithms, especially when the number of meta-training tasks is limited. Specifically, the key ideas and contributions are:- MLTI generates additional tasks by randomly sampling task pairs from the meta-training tasks and performing interpolation on the features/labels of the sampled tasks. This helps densify the task distribution when the available tasks are sparsely sampled.- Two variants of MLTI are proposed - one for label-sharing tasks which interpolates both features and labels, and one for non-label-sharing tasks which only interpolates features.- Theoretically, the paper proves that MLTI acts as an implicit regularization that controls the Rademacher complexity and reduces generalization error for both gradient-based and metric-based meta-learning algorithms.- Empirically, experiments on 8 datasets from diverse domains show MLTI consistently improves performance over baseline and other regularization methods for meta-learning. The gains are especially significant when number of meta-training tasks is small.- MLTI is shown to be compatible with various representative meta-learning algorithms like MAML, Prototypical Networks, Matching Networks etc.In summary, the core contribution is proposing MLTI, an effective and general task augmentation strategy to improve generalization of meta-learning methods by densifying the task distribution through task interpolation. This is supported by both theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.
