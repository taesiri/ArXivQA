# [Efficient and Modular Implicit Differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15183)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the central research question addressed in this paper is:

How can we develop an efficient and modular approach to automatically differentiate the solution of optimization problems with respect to their parameters?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) By defining a mapping function F that captures the optimality conditions of the optimization problem, we can leverage implicit differentiation and autodiff of F to efficiently compute derivatives. 

2) This approach will be more efficient than explicitly differentiating through unrolled optimization algorithm iterations.

3) Defining F in a modular way separate from the optimization solver will make this approach widely applicable. 

The authors propose automatic implicit differentiation as a framework to address these hypotheses, and demonstrate its efficiency and modularity through theoretical analysis and experiments on several applications. The main novelty seems to be providing a generic and easy-to-use approach to implicit differentiation that leverages autodiff systems like JAX, rather than requiring manual case-by-case derivations and implementations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is introducing a framework for automatic implicit differentiation of optimization problem solutions. The key ideas are:

- The user provides a Python function F capturing the optimality conditions of the optimization problem to differentiate. This makes the framework very flexible and modular. 

- Leveraging autodiff of F combined with the implicit function theorem allows automatic computation of derivatives, removing the need for tedious manual derivations.

- The framework is efficient as it can leverage state-of-the-art solvers, unlike approaches based on unrolling.

- The paper demonstrates the framework on a large catalog of optimality conditions, including stationary points, KKT conditions, proximal gradient, projected gradient, mirror descent, Newton, and more. This shows the wide applicability.

- Theoretical analysis is provided on the error when differentiating approximate solutions. This is validated empirically.

- The ease of solving complex bi-level optimization problems is demonstrated through experiments on hyperparameter optimization, dataset distillation, and task-driven dictionary learning.

- An application to sensitivity analysis for molecular dynamics is presented.

Overall, the paper significantly lowers the barrier for using implicit differentiation in practice through an efficient, flexible and modular framework integrated within JAX.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a summary of the key points from the paper in one sentence:

The paper proposes an efficient and modular approach for automatic implicit differentiation of optimization problems by having the user define a mapping function capturing the optimality conditions, then using autodiff and the implicit function theorem to differentiate the optimization solution.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to related work:

- This paper proposes a framework for automatic implicit differentiation of optimization problems. Other works like CasADi and tutorial on implicit diff in JAX also aim to make implicit differentiation more accessible, but this paper provides a more extensive framework with a large catalog of optimality condition mappings. 

- Compared to differentiating through unrolled optimization iterations, this approach can leverage state-of-the-art solvers and avoids memory issues from backpropagating through many iterations. The tradeoff is some loss of precision from approximating the true solution. This paper provides analysis on the Jacobian error in this setting.

- For bilevel optimization, this approach offers a complementary technique to other methods like gradient descent, penalty methods, and recursive differentiation. A benefit is the ability to leverage state-of-the-art solvers.

- The proposed framework seems very flexible and able to handle a wide range of problems. The paper demonstrates applications to hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, sensitivity analysis, etc.

- An interesting aspect is the ability to decouple the choice of solver and fixed point mapping used for differentiation. This provides modularity and flexibility.

- The integration with JAX for automatic differentiation seems like a major strength. Together with the large catalog of mappings, this substantially lowers the barrier for practitioners to use implicit differentiation.

Overall, this paper makes important contributions around making implicit differentiation more usable and integrating it with automatic differentiation systems like JAX. The breadth of applications is impressive. The analysis of Jacobian error and precision is also valuable. If the software is released, it could have high impact by making these techniques more accessible.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Extending the framework to handle cases where the implicit function theorem's differentiability and invertibility conditions are not satisfied, using tools like nonsmooth analysis. The current framework relies on these conditions holding.

- Developing more sophisticated linear system solvers that are tailored for the linear systems arising in implicit differentiation. The paper currently uses standard solvers like conjugate gradient and GMRES. 

- Exploring other applications of the framework like optimization layers and implicit neural networks. The paper focuses on bi-level optimization and sensitivity analysis.

- Scaling up the approach to very high-dimensional problems, which may require specialized preconditioners or approximations. The experiments in the paper are relatively small-scale.

- Comparing in more depth to other differentiation techniques like forward/reverse mode AD on unrolled iterations. The paper makes some comparisons but there is scope for more analysis.

- Extending the framework to stochastic optimization settings like SGD. The optimality conditions currently assume deterministic optimization.

- Developing more specialized optimality condition mappings that exploit problem structure beyond the general mappings proposed. This could improve efficiency.

- Analyzing the effect of inexact solves, early stopping, and precision of linear system solvers on the Jacobian error bounds. Only exact solves are analyzed currently.

So in summary, extending the framework's applicability, efficiency, scalability, and analyzing it in more depth seem like the key future directions based on this paper. The authors lay out a general approach but there are many opportunities to build on it.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. The key idea is that the user defines a function F capturing the optimality conditions of the optimization problem to be differentiated. Then, by using autodiff on F and applying the implicit function theorem, the framework can automatically compute derivatives of the optimization problem's solution with respect to parameters. This allows integrating implicit differentiation with modern autodiff frameworks like JAX in a simple and modular way. The user only needs to express the optimality conditions in Python; the tedious mathematical derivations are avoided. The paper demonstrates the approach on a variety of optimality conditions like KKT conditions, fixed point equations, and more. It is shown to enable easy implementation of applications like bi-level optimization and sensitivity analysis. A theoretical analysis is also provided on the accuracy of the estimated Jacobian. Overall, the paper makes implicit differentiation of optimization problems as easy as autodiff, unlocking new applications.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach for automatic implicit differentiation to easily differentiate optimization problem solutions. The key idea is that the user provides a Python function capturing the optimality conditions of the optimization problem to be differentiated. The framework then leverages autodiff and the implicit function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem solution. 

The authors demonstrate the generality of their approach by applying it to differentiate a variety of optimization problems based on different optimality conditions, including stationary points, KKT conditions, proximal gradient fixed points, and more. They highlight four applications: hyperparameter optimization for multiclass SVMs, dataset distillation, task-driven dictionary learning, and sensitivity analysis in molecular dynamics. Comparing to differentiating unrolled optimization iterations, their approach is shown to be more computationally efficient. Theoretically, the authors provide analysis bounding the Jacobian error when only an approximate solution is available. Overall, this work makes differentiating optimization solutions more accessible by combining implicit differentiation and autodiff in a modular framework.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in this paper:

This paper proposes an approach for automatic implicit differentiation, which allows users to easily add implicit differentiation capabilities on top of existing solvers. The key idea is that the user provides a mapping function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the optimization problem solved by the algorithm. Once this mapping is defined, the method combines the implicit function theorem and automatic differentiation of $F$ to differentiate the optimization problem solution. Specifically, the Jacobian $\partial x^\star(\theta)$ is computed by solving the linear system $-\partial_1 F(x^\star(\theta), \theta) \partial x^\star(\theta) = \partial_2 F(x^\star(\theta), \theta)$, where $\partial_1 F$ and $\partial_2 F$ are obtained via autodiff. This approach combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff - it is efficient as it leverages state-of-the-art solvers, and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the differentiation. The authors demonstrate the approach on various optimality conditions and applications.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 This paper proposes a new approach for automatically differentiating solutions of optimization problems with respect to their inputs. The key problem it aims to address is that optimization problems generally do not have closed-form solutions that can be differentiated explicitly. Therefore, computing derivatives of their solutions is challenging. 

The paper presents a framework called "automatic implicit differentiation" to tackle this issue. The key ideas are:

- The user provides a mapping function F that captures the optimality conditions of the optimization problem to be differentiated (e.g. stationarity conditions, KKT conditions, etc). 

- Leveraging implicit function theorem and autodiff of F, the framework can then automatically compute derivatives of the optimization problem's solution with respect to inputs.

- This allows differentiation of optimization solutions in a modular way, without having to manually derive and implement differentiation formulas for each optimality condition.

- It is also efficient as it can use state-of-the-art optimizers, unlike approaches based on unrolling an optimization algorithm.

In summary, the paper provides a generic, modular and efficient approach to automate differentiation of optimization problem solutions, lowering the barriers compared to prior techniques.
