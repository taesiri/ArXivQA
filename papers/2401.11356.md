# [ProLex: A Benchmark for Language Proficiency-oriented Lexical   Substitution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11356)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing lexical substitution systems only focus on generating contextually appropriate substitutes, but do not consider the language proficiency level of the substitutes. This is insufficient to help improve vocabulary diversity and writing proficiency for English language learners. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new task called "language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution" to generate substitutes that are not only contextually suitable but also demonstrate higher proficiency levels compared to the original target word.

- They introduce a new benchmark called ProLex to assess systems on this task. ProLex contains quadruplets of (target word, context sentence, acceptable substitutes, proficiency-oriented substitutes).

- The sentences and target words in ProLex are extracted from essays written by non-native speakers in the TOEFL-11 corpus. This represents the distribution of words commonly used by English learners. 

- Two linguistic PhD students annotated the candidate substitutes from GPT-4 based on an annotation scheme considering meaning preservation, common English collocations, lexical diversity and grammar correctness.

- The acceptable substitutes are further filtered by CEFR levels to only keep those with equal or higher proficiency than target words.

- Authors also trained models on task-specific synthetic data and evaluated on ProLex. The best model was Llama2-13B fine-tuned on a mix of synthetic and modified benchmark data.

Main Contributions:

- New task of language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution to improve writing proficiency of non-native English speakers

- Novel benchmark ProLex to assess lexical substitution systems on generating contextually appropriate and higher proficiency level substitutes

- Annotation scheme and methodology to construct ProLex leveraging non-native corpus, expert annotations and CEFR filtering

- Experiments showing trained models can match or exceed performance of GPT-4 and ChatGPT on ProLex


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new lexical substitution task and benchmark that focuses on generating substitutes which are not only contextually appropriate but also demonstrate higher language proficiency to help improve vocabulary diversity and writing skills of non-native English learners.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are threefold:

1. It proposes a new task called "language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution" to help L2 English learners enhance their vocabulary diversity and writing proficiency. 

2. It presents a novel benchmark called ProLex to assess systems' ability to perform the task by generating substitutes that are not only contextually appropriate but also reflect advanced language proficiency levels.

3. It fine-tuned models with task-specific synthetic data and evaluated them on ProLex. The models achieve results that are comparable to or better than out-of-the-box LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT.

In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a new lexical substitution task and benchmark (ProLex) that considers language proficiency in addition to contextual appropriateness, as well as models trained on synthetic data that can perform well on this new benchmark.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution - The new task proposed to help improve vocabulary diversity and writing proficiency of L2 English learners by generating substitutes that are not only contextually suitable but also reflect advanced language proficiency levels. 

- ProLex - The novel benchmark dataset introduced to assess systems' ability to perform language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution. It contains quadruplets with target word, context sentence, acceptable substitutes, and proficiency-oriented substitutes.

- Instruction tuning - The process of fine-tuning language models on task-specific synthetic data to perform well on ProLex. Models like Llama2-13B and Vicuna-1.5-13B were instruction-tuned.

- Zero-shot evaluation - Evaluating the performance of LLMs like GPT-4 and ChatGPT in a zero-shot prompting setting on ProLex.

- Soft evaluation vs Hard evaluation - Soft evaluation lemmatizes system predictions before comparison while hard evaluation requires exact match without lemmatization. Used to evaluate system performance.

- Precision, Recall, F-score - Evaluation metrics used to measure the quality and coverage of predicted substitutes on ProLex. F-score specifically balances precision and recall.

In summary, the key ideas focus on the new task, benchmark, and models for language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution evaluated in both zero-shot and instruction-tuned settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new task called "language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution". What is the key motivation behind proposing this new task and how is it different from existing lexical substitution tasks?

2. The paper constructs a new benchmark called ProLex for evaluating systems on the proposed task. Walk through the key steps involved in creating ProLex - from selecting the corpus for extracting sentences, to generating candidate substitutes using GPT-4, to the annotation process and guidelines, to filtering substitutes based on CEFR levels. 

3. The annotation scheme for ProLex focuses on several criteria like meaning preservation, common English collocations, lexical diversity and grammatical correctness. Elaborate on each of these criteria with examples from the paper. What is the rationale behind including these specific criteria?

4. The paper uses the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) levels to filter candidate substitutes and construct the final ProLex quadruplet. Explain what CEFR is and what the different proficiency levels under CEFR signify. Why is using CEFR suitable for determining language proficiency in the context of this task?

5. The authors experiment with multiple methods/models - existing lexical substitution systems, instruction tuning LMs on synthetic data, zero-shot prompting of LLMs. Compare and contrast the results obtained by these methods. Which method performs the best on ProLex and why?

6. The authors use two approaches to synthesize training data for fine-tuning language models - generating data using GPT-4 and modifying existing data from Swords benchmark. Compare these two approaches and analyze the impact of using data synthesized by each approach in the overall performance.

7. The fine-tuned Llama2-13B model achieves results comparable to GPT-4 on ProLex. Analyze the possible reasons why instruction tuning on synthetic data leads to such strong performance compared to out-of-the-box LLMs.

8. What are the limitations of existing lexical substitution systems like BERT-LS and Para-LS that lead to their significantly lower performance compared to LLMs on ProLex?

9. The paper mostly focuses on generative evaluation of models on ProLex. What is the other type of evaluation setting mentioned and why is it not experimented with in the paper?

10. The authors state some avenues for future work at the end, like expanding ProLex using a larger corpus and more comprehensive substitutes. Brainstorm some other potential future research directions for this task.
