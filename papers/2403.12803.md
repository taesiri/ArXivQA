# [DreamDA: Generative Data Augmentation with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12803)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Acquiring large-scale, high-quality training data is expensive and time-consuming, which limits the performance of deep learning models when data is scarce. 
- Existing data augmentation (DA) methods like cropping/flipping preserve semantics well but lack diversity. Generative DA methods using diffusion models show promise but have issues like domain gap between real and synthetic images, and lack of diversity.

Proposed Solution - DreamDA:
- Proposes a new perturbation approach during reverse diffusion to generate diverse in-distribution images using diffusion models. Specifically, it inverts seed images to latent space, then adds Gaussian noise to U-Net bottleneck features at each reverse diffusion step.

- Introduces Asymmetric Multi-Head Self-Training (AMST) to assign labels to synthetic images. Uses 4 auxiliary classifiers to predict consistent and confident pseudo-labels. Unlabeled images have consistency regularization loss.

Main Contributions:
- Perturbation approach enables generating diverse images adhering to real data distribution by considering real images as seeds. 

- AMST ensures accurate and reliable pseudo labels for synthetic images. Consistency loss allows learning perturbation-invariant features.

- Achieves SOTA performance across 4 tasks and 5 datasets. Outperforms DA baselines by 41% and diffusion baselines by 7.4% when trained from scratch on natural images. Demonstrates wide applicability.

In summary, DreamDA introduces an effective latent perturbation approach and self-training method to generate diverse labeled synthetic images for data augmentation across vision tasks. Experiments validate efficacy of DreamDA over strong baselines.
