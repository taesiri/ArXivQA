# [Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08500)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:

- How can we effectively transfer spatial-wise knowledge from CNNs to vision transformers without needing to align intermediate features? 

- How can we leverage CNNs' local inductive bias to help vision transformers converge faster initially, while still allowing the transformers to reach their full global modeling potential later in training?

The authors identify two key problems with distilling knowledge from CNNs to vision transformers:

1) The difference in network architectures makes aligning intermediate features for spatial knowledge transfer inefficient. 

2) Relying only on CNNs' local inductive bias can limit the vision transformers' convergence late in training, since the CNN teachers have lower capacity. 

To address these issues, the paper proposes Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD), which:

- Transfers spatial knowledge to vision transformers by generating dense predictions from CNNs and using them to supervise the vision transformers' patch tokens. This avoids complex feature alignment.

- Uses a Cumulative Knowledge Fusion module that emphasizes CNNs' local responses early in training and global responses later, allowing the vision transformer student to leverage different inductive biases over time.

So in summary, the main hypotheses appear to be that CSKD can enable more efficient spatial knowledge transfer and improved convergence for vision transformer students compared to prior distillation approaches. The experiments aim to validate whether CSKD achieves these goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper proposes a method called Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) for training Vision Transformers (ViTs) by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The key contributions are:

- It identifies two issues with distilling knowledge from CNNs to ViTs: (1) inefficient transfer of spatial knowledge due to misaligned features, and (2) limited convergence later in training due to different inductive biases.

- It presents CSKD to address these issues by:

(1) Transferring spatial knowledge to ViT patch tokens from corresponding CNN feature map locations, without aligning intermediate features. 

(2) Introducing a Cumulative Knowledge Fusion (CKF) module that emphasizes global CNN predictions later in training, allowing ViT to leverage its capabilities fully.

- It demonstrates improved performance over baseline methods like DeiT and DearKD on ImageNet and other datasets. The visualizations and analysis provide insights into how CSKD enables better usage of ViT's global modeling capacity.

In summary, the main contribution is the CSKD method that alleviates key limitations of distilling knowledge from CNNs to ViTs through spatial transfer and cumulative fusion of local and global knowledge. The improved results and analysis demonstrate its effectiveness.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a new method called Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) for distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to vision transformers (ViTs). Here are some key comparisons to other related works:

- Compared to the original DeiT paper that first proposed distilling from CNNs to ViTs, CSKD improves the efficiency of spatial knowledge transfer by avoiding intermediate feature alignment. It also better leverages ViT's capabilities by cumulatively fusing global and local knowledge from the CNN.

- Compared to DearKD, another recent method for distilling CNN knowledge to ViTs, CSKD takes a simpler approach without needing specialized modules or a two-stage training process. DearKD modifies ViT's architecture for better feature alignment and stops distillation in the second stage.

- Compared to CviT, which uses multiple teacher networks, CSKD only needs a single CNN teacher but effectively transfers both local and global knowledge via dense predictions. CviT explores teachers with different inductive biases but is more computationally expensive.

- CSKD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet compared to DeiT and other CNN distillation methods. It also shows better transfer learning performance on various downstream tasks.

In summary, CSKD provides an effective and lightweight approach to leverage CNN knowledge for ViT training, avoiding complex feature aligners or multi-teacher overhead. The spatial knowledge transfer and cumulative fusion of global information help CSKD fully exploit ViT capabilities. The comparisons show CSKD advances the state-of-the-art in an efficient and well-motivated manner.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors are:

- Exploring other ways to align the intermediate features between CNNs and ViTs more effectively for spatial-wise knowledge transfer. The paper discusses how the differences in network architectures make aligning features difficult. The authors suggest exploring alternate approaches to enable better feature alignment.

- Investigating other methods to give ViTs more image-friendly inductive biases while retaining their capability to model global relations. The paper shows ViTs can benefit from CNNs' inductive biases but too much limits their global modeling. Finding the right balance could further improve performance. 

- Applying the ideas from CSKD to other vision architectures and tasks beyond image classification. The authors propose CSKD for ViTs on image classification but suggest it may transfer to other architectures and tasks like detection and segmentation.

- Exploring ensemble approaches that utilize all patch tokens for prediction. The paper briefly mentions this could provide further gains but leave it to future work.

- Studying how to best combine multiple teacher networks with different inductive biases as in Co-distillation. The authors suggest this as an alternate way to provide richer supervision.

- Further analysis and visualization of how the spatial supervision guides ViT training over time. The authors provide some initial analysis but suggest more work can be done to understand the interactions.

In summary, the main future directions are around better feature alignment, balancing global and local modeling, extending CSKD to other tasks/models, ensemble approaches, using multiple teachers, and further analysis of the training dynamics. The authors propose CSKD as an initial step with ample room for future work in knowledge distillation for ViTs.

CSKD transfers spatial knowledge to the patch tokens of ViT using the spatial responses of CNN, avoiding inefficient feature alignment.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a method called Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) to improve the performance of vision transformers (ViTs) by distilling knowledge from convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The authors identify two key problems with distilling knowledge from CNNs to ViTs: 1) the different network architectures make aligning intermediate features difficult, limiting efficiency of spatial knowledge transfer, and 2) the inductive bias of CNNs limits the convergence of ViTs in later training. 

To address these issues, CSKD transfers spatial knowledge by generating dense classification predictions from the CNN's last features to supervise the patch tokens of the ViT, avoiding intermediate feature alignment. CSKD also uses a Cumulative Knowledge Fusion module to increasingly emphasize the CNN's global prediction over its local predictions during training. This allows the CNN's local inductive bias to aid early convergence, while giving the ViT's global modeling capability full play later in training. Experiments on ImageNet and downstream tasks show CSKD's improvements over baseline ViTs and prior distillation techniques. Visualizations and analysis demonstrate CSKD's ability to better leverage the ViT's global modeling capacity.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) method to improve vision transformer (ViT) training via knowledge transfer from a convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher. CSKD transfers spatial-wise knowledge to the patch tokens of the ViT student by generating dense classification predictions from the CNN teacher's last feature map. These predictions provide supervision for the corresponding patch tokens in the ViT student without needing aligned intermediate features. CSKD also uses a Cumulative Knowledge Fusion (CKF) module to increasingly emphasize the CNN teacher's global prediction over its dense spatial predictions during training. This leverages the CNN's local inductive bias early in training when the ViT benefits most from it, while allowing the ViT to reach its full global modeling potential later in training. The combined spatial transfer and emphasis on global knowledge over time in CSKD improves ViT training efficiency and accuracy.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of knowledge distillation from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to vision transformers (ViTs). Specifically, it highlights two key issues with distilling knowledge from CNNs to ViTs:

1. The different network architectures make it difficult to effectively transfer spatial/local knowledge from CNNs to ViTs via intermediate feature mimicking. The inductive biases are very different between CNNs and ViTs, so their intermediate features don't align well semantically.

2. While CNN knowledge helps ViTs converge faster initially, it limits their performance later in training. The CNN teacher has a weaker representational capacity than the ViT student. So relying too much on the CNN teacher's guidance can restrict the ViT from reaching its full potential later in training when it has surpassed the teacher's capabilities.

To address these issues, the paper proposes a method called Cumulative Spatial Knowledge Distillation (CSKD). The key ideas are:

- Transfer spatial knowledge by generating dense predictions from the CNN, and using them to supervise the ViT's patch tokens directly without intermediate feature alignment.

- Use a Cumulative Knowledge Fusion (CKF) module to increasingly emphasize the CNN's global prediction over its local spatial predictions as training progresses. This relies more on the CNN's localization early on, but shifts to the ViT's own learning later.

In summary, the key problems are the inefficient spatial knowledge transfer and limiting of ViT performance when distilling knowledge from CNNs. CSKD provides solutions through direct spatial supervision and cumulative fusion of local/global knowledge.
