# [Conditional Image-to-Video Generation with Latent Flow Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13744)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to achieve conditional image-to-video generation that can simultaneously produce realistic spatial details and temporally coherent motions. Specifically, the paper proposes a new approach called "latent flow diffusion models" (LFDM) to tackle the conditional image-to-video generation task. The key hypothesis is that disentangling the generation of spatial contents and temporal dynamics can lead to better results on this task. To test this hypothesis, the paper designs a two-stage training framework for LFDM:1) In stage one, it trains a latent flow auto-encoder in an unsupervised fashion to learn a mapping between image frames and latent representations. This auto-encoder can estimate optical flow between frames and warp images in the latent space.2) In stage two, it trains a diffusion model to generate coherent latent flow sequences conditioned on the input image and class label. This diffusion model only needs to model a low-dimensional latent flow space containing motion/shape information.By evaluating on multiple datasets, the paper shows that the proposed LFDM approach consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for conditional image-to-video generation. The results support the hypothesis that disentangling spatial and temporal generation through latent flow modeling leads to better performance on this task.In summary, the central hypothesis is on using latent flow diffusion models for disentangled spatial-temporal modeling to achieve high-quality conditional image-to-video generation. The experiments confirm the advantage of this approach over previous methods.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel conditional image-to-video generation method called Latent Flow Diffusion Models (LFDM). The key ideas are:- LFDM generates videos by synthesizing a sequence of optical flow in the latent space conditioned on the input image and class label. It uses this latent flow sequence to warp the input image frame-by-frame to generate the output video. - Compared to previous methods that directly synthesize pixels or features in space-time volume, LFDM operates on a simpler latent flow space that only captures motion dynamics. This allows more efficient video generation.- LFDM is trained in two separate stages - an unsupervised stage to learn a latent flow autoencoder, and a conditional stage to train a diffusion model for latent flow sequence generation. This disentangled training strategy enables flexible model adaptation.- Extensive experiments show LFDM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets of facial expressions, human actions and gestures. It also demonstrates good generalization ability to unseen images and new domains through decoder fine-tuning.In summary, the key novelty is using conditional diffusion models to generate coherent latent flows for warping the input image, instead of direct pixel/feature synthesis. This simple but effective idea allows LFDM to better preserve spatial details and ensure temporal continuity in generated videos. The two-stage disentangled training further enables flexible model adaptation.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points in the paper:The paper proposes a novel conditional image-to-video generation framework called Latent Flow Diffusion Models (LFDM) that generates videos by first using a diffusion model to synthesize a sequence of optical flow in the latent space based on a class condition, and then warps the given image frame-by-frame with the generated flow to produce a new video that preserves the spatial details of the original image while exhibiting new motions corresponding to the class condition.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper presents a novel method for conditional image-to-video generation using latent flow diffusion models (LFDM). Here are some key comparisons to other related works:- Most prior image-to-video (I2V) generation methods directly synthesize each video frame based on the given image, which can struggle to simultaneously generate realistic spatial details and temporal dynamics. This paper proposes a different approach based on warping the given image with a generated flow sequence in latent space. This allows fully reusing the spatial content and can better preserve subject appearance and motion continuity.- Many recent video generation works use diffusion models (DMs), but operate on pixel space or high-dimensional latent spaces that couple spatial and temporal features. This can be computationally expensive and make training difficult. This paper instead applies DMs to generate optical flow in a simpler, low-dimensional latent space focused only on motion.- Most flow-based video generation works learn separate modules for flow prediction and flow-based frame generation. This paper jointly trains these together end-to-end in an autoencoder framework to better learn the mapping between flow, occlusion, and output frames.- The two-stage disentangled training strategy provides flexibility. Spatial content can be improved by enhancing the image decoder in stage one without retraining the DM in stage two. The paper shows this enables easy adaptation to new domains by finetuning just the decoder with unlabeled videos.- Experiments demonstrate superior performance over recent state-of-the-art baselines including ImaGINator, video DMs, and latent DMs. The model also shows good generalization to unseen images, fewer artifacts, and efficient sampling.In summary, the key novelty is using DMs to generate latent optical flow for conditional I2V generation, and the benefits over prior arts stem from the warp-based approach, two-stage disentangled training framework, and simpler latent flow space focused solely on motion.
