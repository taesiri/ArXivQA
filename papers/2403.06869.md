# [Learning with Noisy Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06869)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Learning with Noisy Foundation Models":

Problem:
Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for downstream tasks. However, the pre-training datasets often contain label noise due to issues in data collection and annotation. This paper investigates how label noise in pre-training data affects the downstream performance of foundation models. Specifically, it aims to answer three key questions:

1) Influence: How does pre-training label noise affect downstream model performance? 
2) Analysis: What causes the influence of pre-training label noise?
3) Mitigation: How to mitigate the negative impacts of pre-training label noise?

Proposed Solution:
Through extensive experiments on noisy ImageNet, YFCC15M and CC12M datasets, the authors make two main observations:

1) Slight pre-training noise (5-10%) improves in-domain (ID) downstream performance but always hurts out-of-domain (OOD) generalization.  
2) Increasing pre-training noise reduces the dominant singular values and increases singular value entropy of the feature space.

Based on the analysis, the authors propose NMTune - a tuning method with three regularization objectives to reshape the feature distribution. NMTune can work in both black-box and parameter-efficient manners.

Main Contributions:
1) Identify and formulate the problem of noisy foundation model learning.
2) Empirically show pre-training noise has dual influence on downstream tasks. 
3) Analyze how pre-training noise shapes feature space based on singular value spectrum.
4) Propose NMTune to mitigate negative impacts of pre-training noise by regularizing feature distribution.
5) Validate NMTune on popular vision and language models to improve generalization.

The paper proposes the novel direction of "Noisy Model Learning" to understand and mitigate the impacts of pre-training noise. It provides comprehensive analysis and an effective tuning method. The results demonstrate the significance of studying noise in large foundation models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper introduces a new research direction called Noisy Model Learning that studies the impact of label noise in pre-training data on downstream tasks, provides analysis showing noise can have mixed effects, and proposes methods to mitigate negative impacts.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a new research direction termed "Noisy Model Learning" (NML). Specifically, the key contributions are:

1) Comprehensively investigating and analyzing the influence of label noise in pre-training data on the downstream performance of foundation models. Through extensive experiments, the paper shows that slight noise can benefit in-domain performance while hurting out-of-domain generalization. 

2) Conducting an empirical analysis to understand why pre-training noise affects downstream tasks differently. The analysis reveals that noise shapes the feature space by decreasing dominant singular values and increasing spanning dimensions, which leads to the observed performance differences.

3) Proposing a tuning method called NMTune to mitigate the malignant effects of pre-training noise. NMTune applies regularization objectives to reshape the feature space and rectify model behaviors affected by noise. Experiments show NMTune's effectiveness in boosting performance of noisy pre-trained models.

4) Demonstrating the efficacy of NMTune in practical scenarios with real-world noisy pre-trained vision and language models. Results validate that NMTune can improve generalization of different foundation models APIs pre-trained on noisy data.

In summary, the paper pioneers the study of pre-training noise's impacts on foundation models, analyzes the underlying reasons, and provides methods to mitigate negative effects. This lays the groundwork for the introduced novel research direction of Noisy Model Learning.
