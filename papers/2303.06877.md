# [Progressive Open Space Expansion for Open-Set Model Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06877)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:How can we expand the open space of classifiers in an efficient and progressive manner to enable open-set model attribution?In particular, the authors propose a method called "Progressive Open Space Expansion" (POSE) to incrementally expand the open space of classifiers to attribute predictions to unknown classes. The key ideas are:- Progressively expanding the open space by generating diverse and hard unknown examples over multiple rounds. - Using a conditional variational autoencoder framework to generate diverse synthetic unknown examples.- Introducing a hardness metric to ensure the unknown examples generated are sufficiently difficult/hard to push the decision boundary.- Performing joint optimization over multiple rounds to expand the open space in an efficient and stable manner.So in summary, the central research question is focused on how to expand the open space of classifiers progressively for open-set model attribution. The POSE method is proposed to address this question.
