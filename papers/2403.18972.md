## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Risk-Aware Robotics: Tail Risk Measures in Planning, Control, and Verification":

Problem Statement
The paper argues that existing paradigms for developing robotic systems - worst-case, risk-neutral, and risk-aware - have limitations in properly accounting for risk, especially rare but highly detrimental outcomes. This is problematic for safety-critical robotics applications like search and rescue. Hence, there is a need for more advanced risk-aware methodologies in robotics. 

The paper advocates the use of tail risk measures like Value-at-Risk (VaR), Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), and Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) for systematically assessing risk. These measures focus on the tails of cost distributions, capturing harmful but unlikely events. The paper reviews the mathematical definitions and properties of these coherent risk measures.

Proposed Solution  
The paper proposes integrating tail risk measures into the planning, control, and verification pipelines of robotics systems to enable risk-aware decision making. 

For planning, the paper suggests optimizing policies and controls to minimize the tail risk measure of a cost function that encodes hazards. It provides an overview of relevant literature utilizing this approach for Markov Decision Processes.

For control, the paper recommends constraints based on tail risk measures of safety-critical metrics like minimum distance to obstacles. It reviews recent risk-aware optimal control techniques using CVaR and EVaR constraints.
 
For verification, the paper puts forth the idea of lower bounding the Value-at-Risk or Conditional Value-at-Risk of trajectory robustness to provide probabilistic safety guarantees. It summarizes related works exploiting this notion.

The paper highlights case studies in risk-aware motion planning for legged robots traversing uncertain terrain and bipedal walking with model uncertainty.

Main Contributions
- Identifies limitations of existing robotic risk assessment paradigms 
- Advocates for coherent tail risk measures to enable risk-aware robotics
- Provides mathematical background on prevalent tail risk measures
- Proposes integrating risk measures into planning, control and verification
- Summarizes relevant literature in these areas

The paper makes a compelling case for advancing robotics via principled integration of tail risk measures for managing rare but detrimental outcomes. The proposed risk-aware pipelines could significantly improve reliability and safety.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in the paper:

1. The paper discusses using tail risk measures such as VaR, CVaR, and EVaR for risk-aware planning, control, and verification. How do these measures allow robotic systems to balance performance and safety more effectively compared to traditional approaches?

2. When formulating the risk-aware behavior planning problem as an MDP, the paper proposes two approaches - optimizing a risk measure over all policies or over the action at each state. What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method? 

3. For motion planning problems, the paper discusses using risk-aware MPC schemes. How do these methods account for uncertainty and risk differently from robust and stochastic MPC formulations?

4. The paper introduces the concept of risk-aware control barrier functions (RCBFs) for safety-critical control. How do RCBFs generalize traditional control barrier functions to provide guarantees on system safety even in the presence of uncertainty? 

5. When discussing risk-aware verification, the paper highlights the ability of temporal logics to quantify how well specifications are satisfied. How does this facilitate the use of tail risk measures compared to more traditional notions of verification?

6. The paper provides an overview of common methods for risk measure estimation based on samples, such as scenario optimization and concentration inequalities. What are the trade-offs between these approaches in terms of computational complexity versus accuracy?

7. For the case study on risk-aware bipedal walking, how is the model discrepancy between the robot's actual dynamics and the H-LIP approximation used to construct a stochastic uncertainty distribution for risk-aware control?

8. In the planning case study for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, how did the risk-aware framework allow systematic adjustment of the overall system risk by modifying the risk level beta? 

9. The paper discusses open questions regarding sample complexity and compositional verification for risk-aware system validation. Why are these issues particularly relevant for practical industrial adoption?

10. What modifications would be needed to apply the proposed risk-aware methods in environments with non-stationary uncertainty distributions or statistically dependent data samples?
