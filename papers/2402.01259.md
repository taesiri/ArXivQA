# [Position Aware 60 GHz mmWave Beamforming for V2V Communications   Utilizing Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01259)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can provide high throughput for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity in connected and autonomous vehicles, but suffer from high path loss. 
- Beamforming with large antenna arrays is used to overcome path loss, but requires accurate beam alignment which has high overhead in terms of latency and computations for dynamic V2V scenarios.  
- Leveraging out-of-band contextual information like vehicle positions instead of just channel measurements can reduce this overhead.

Proposed Solution:
- A deep learning model is proposed to predict the optimal beams for V2V connectivity using the vehicle position information. 
- The model takes the normalized latitude and longitude of the receiver vehicle as input.
- It uses convolutional blocks for feature extraction followed by flatten, fully-connected and softmax layers to output probabilities of the top beams.
- Beam index with maximum probability is chosen to maximize received power.

Key Contributions:
- Novel deep learning based beam selection for 60 GHz V2V mmWave links using only position information.
- Evaluated on real-world datasets with moving vehicles in different scenarios.
- Achieves 19.67% higher accuracy than baseline with same overhead. 
- Up to 84.58% of optimal received power obtained on average.
- Significantly reduces beam alignment overhead compared to traditional approaches relying only on channel measurements.

In summary, the paper proposes a deep learning solution to effectively leverage vehicle position information for accurate and low-overhead mmWave beam alignment in dynamic V2V scenarios, instead of traditional beam sweeping approaches. The results on real datasets showcase its effectiveness.
