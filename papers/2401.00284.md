# [Evaluation is all you need. Prompting Generative Large Language Models   for Annotation Tasks in the Social Sciences. A Primer using Open Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00284)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper explores the challenges with using proprietary large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT for annotation tasks in social sciences research. Key issues highlighted include limited reproducibility, privacy concerns when sharing sensitive data through APIs, and prevalence of English-centric models.  

Proposed Solution: 
The paper advocates the adoption of open and locally operated models as an alternative, to enhance privacy and reproducibility without compromising on capabilities. It showcases two annotation tasks - sentiment analysis in tweets and identifying leisure activities in childhood essays - using 5 open models with 7B parameters.

Contributions:
- Demonstrates applicability of open models for sentiment classification and information extraction tasks using multiple prompting strategies 
- Compares performance across neural-chat-7b-v3-2, Starling-LM-7B-alpha, openchat_3.5, zephyr-7b-alpha and zephyr-7b-beta models
- Best prompt achieved 71% F1 score for tweet sentiment analysis and 86% accuracy for leisure activity detection in essays
- Emphasizes need for careful validation of generative models through comparison with gold standard data
- Highlights advantage of reproducibility using local models with ability to set seeds before each run
- Open models mitigate privacy risks and external data sharing requirements suitable for sensitive research data
- Provides guidelines and python code for leveraging open models in annotation tasks as an alternative to proprietary models

In summary, the key highlights are promoting open models to enhance privacy and reproducibility, showcasing their effectiveness across two annotation tasks, and emphasizing the need for validation while using their code to enable adoption. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper explores the use of open generative large language models for annotation tasks in social sciences, advocating for their adoption over proprietary models to enhance reproducibility and data privacy while providing examples of sentiment analysis and leisure activity identification to demonstrate prompting strategies.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is demonstrating the application of open generative large language models (LLMs) for text annotation tasks in social sciences research. Specifically, the paper:

1) Highlights the advantages of using open models compared to proprietary models in terms of reproducibility, privacy, and security when dealing with sensitive data. It advocates for adopting open models that can be downloaded and operated independently.

2) Provides two examples of using different prompting strategies with multiple open LLMs to classify sentiments in tweets and identify mentions of leisure activities in childhood aspirational essays. This illustrates the process and evaluation of using generative models for annotation.

3) Emphasizes the need for careful validation of the models' performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 scores and kappa statistics. The results indicate variation based on prompts and models, underscoring the importance of tailored prompt engineering.  

4) Discusses insights from the analysis - while generative models show potential for text annotation, their reliability needs confirmation. If results are unsatisfactory, alternatives like fine-tuning traditional classification models should be explored.

In summary, the key contribution is promoting and demonstrating the application of open generative LLMs for text annotation in social sciences by highlighting their advantages and providing a methodology for evaluation using two annotation task examples. The paper stresses the importance of validation to determine suitability.
