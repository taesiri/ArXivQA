# [LLMLingua-2: Data Distillation for Efficient and Faithful Task-Agnostic   Prompt Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12968)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing task-agnostic prompt compression methods rely on information entropy from causal language models, which may fail to capture all essential information needed for effective compression. 
- They are not explicitly optimized for the compression task.

Proposed Solution:
- Construct an extractive text compression dataset by distilling knowledge from GPT-4 to compress prompts without losing crucial information or introducing hallucinated content.
- Formulate prompt compression as a token classification task to guarantee faithfulness. Use a Transformer encoder to leverage full bidirectional context.
- Train smaller models like XLM-RoBERTa-large and mBERT to explicitly optimize for compression objective for lower latency.

Contributions:
- Introduce an extractive text compression dataset derived from MeetingBank transcripts using a data distillation procedure.
- Approaching prompt compression as a token classification task allows capturing essential information from full bidirectional context.
- Despite small size, proposed models show significant gains over baselines and robust generalization ability across different target LLMs. 
- Proposed compressor is 3x-6x faster than prior methods, while accelerating end-to-end latency by 1.6x-2.9x.

In summary, the key ideas are using data distillation to construct a text compression dataset, formulating prompt compression as a token classification task, and training smaller models to explicitly optimize the compression objective. This leads to performance gains, faster compression, and better generalization across domains and target LLMs.

 This paper proposes a data distillation method to construct an extractive text compression dataset, and develops a token classification model to compress prompts in a task-agnostic manner while retaining essential information and ensuring faithfulness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a data distillation procedure to derive knowledge from an LLM (GPT-4) to compress prompts without losing crucial information, and introducing an extractive text compression dataset.

2. Formulating prompt compression as a token classification problem to guarantee faithfulness of the compressed prompt, and using a Transformer encoder to capture essential information from full bidirectional context.
