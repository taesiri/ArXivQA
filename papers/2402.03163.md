# [Linguistic features for sentence difficulty prediction in ABSA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03163)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement
- Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to extract and analyze subjective information from text at a fine-grained, aspect level. However, there is no clear definition of what makes a sentence difficult for ABSA models. 

- This paper explores the impact of domain/syntactic diversity on difficulty and studies linguistic features to estimate sentence difficulty for ABSA. The key research questions are:
   1) What is the impact of domain and syntactic diversity on difficulty?
   2) Which linguistic features can help estimate sentence difficulty? 
   3) What is the performance difference between traditional models and large language models (LLMs)?

Methodology
- Experiments conducted with 21 models on 3 datasets - Laptops, Restaurants, MTSC across 2 text representations (TF-IDF, BERT)
- Datasets merged to introduce domain and syntactic diversity 
- Fine-tuned BERT also experimented on datasets
- 9 linguistic features identified to predict binary and multi-level difficulty
- Traditional models compared to fine-tuned BERT

Key Findings
- MTSC dataset most difficult compared to Laptops and Restaurants
- Addition of new domains/syntactic forms didn't increase difficulty over just using MTSC
- Fine-tuned BERT benefited from more data, outperforming traditional models
- Identified linguistic features insufficient to successfully estimate difficulty
- Sufficient data allows fine-tuned BERT to outperform traditional models

Major Contributions
- Empirically analyzed impact of domain/syntactic diversity on ABSA difficulty
- Studied linguistic features for estimating sentence difficulty
- Benchmarked traditional models against fine-tuned BERT to showcase need for sufficient data with LLMs
- Laid groundwork for better understanding ABSA difficulty to improve efficiency/effectiveness tradeoff

Future Work
- Explore corpora in other domains with greater difficulty 
- Identify better linguistic features to estimate difficulty
- Develop predictors inspired by Query Performance Prediction in IR
- Formalize definition of difficulty based on experiments
