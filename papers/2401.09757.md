# [Cooperative Tri-Point Model-Based Ground-to-Air Coverage Extension in   Beyond 5G Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09757)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Extending wireless coverage from terrestrial base stations (TBSs) to aerial user equipments (AUEs) is challenging due to the down-tilted antennas of TBSs which fail to provide adequate coverage in the vertical direction. Achieving optimal 3D airspace coverage by adjusting TBS antennas is difficult due to the complex coverage requirements, especially in the vertical dimension. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a cooperative tri-point (CoTP) model based method to enhance ground-to-air (G2A) coverage extension in cellular networks. The key ideas are:

1) Prove that cooperation between 3 TBSs can provide G2A coverage with minimum overlap. Based on this, design a CoTP model to analyze G2A coverage.  

2) Develop a Delaunay Triangulation (DT) based cooperative coverage structure to divide the 3D airspace into triangular prism (TP) shaped subspaces and formulate TBS cooperation sets for each subspace.

3) Design two cooperative beam generation algorithms - Space Layered Beam Cooperative (SLBC) and Adaptive Beam Cooperative (ABC) to determine antenna parameters of each TBS to maximize coverage ratio in each TP airspace while controlling overlap.

Key Contributions:

- Proof of minimum overlap property with 3 TBS cooperation and proposal of CoTP model for G2A coverage analysis 

- DT-based cooperative coverage structure for efficient 3D airspace division and TBS cooperation sets formulation

- SLBC algorithm for parameterized cooperative beam generation covering low, medium and high airspace layers  

- ABC algorithm for adjustable cooperative beam generation preventing inter-region power leakage

- Extensive simulations and field trials demonstrating significant improvement in G2A coverage over down-tilted antenna based cellular networks

The proposed CoTP model based cooperative coverage method provides an effective solution to extend G2A coverage while ensuring ground coverage in cellular networks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a cooperative tri-point model-based method to enhance ground-to-air coverage in cellular networks by designing cooperative base station sets and optimizing their antenna parameters.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a cooperative tri-point (CoTP) model to analyze the ground-to-air (G2A) coverage extension in existing cellular networks. Based on this model, a Delaunay triangulation (DT) based cooperative coverage structure is designed to divide the airspace into triangular prism (TP) shaped subspaces and formulate terrestrial base station (TBS) cooperation sets.

2. It designs two cooperative beam generation algorithms - space layered beam cooperative (SLBC) coverage algorithm and adaptive beam cooperative (ABC) coverage algorithm, to maximize the coverage ratio in each TP-shaped airspace while controlling the overlap ratio. The SLBC algorithm handles discrete antenna parameters while the ABC algorithm allows continuous adjustment.

3. It conducts extensive simulations and field trials to evaluate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed CoTP-based method can improve the G2A coverage ratio by 83% compared to using down-tilted antennas, while ensuring ground coverage.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing a cooperative coverage model and optimization method to efficiently extend G2A coverage leveraging existing cellular infrastructure. The performance gains are validated through simulations and real-world testing.
