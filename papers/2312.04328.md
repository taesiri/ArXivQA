# [A Multi-scale Information Integration Framework for Infrared and Visible   Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04328)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a multi-scale dual attention (MDA) framework for infrared and visible image fusion. The method first decomposes the input images into multi-scale representations using residual downsample blocks. Dual attention fusion blocks then integrate complementary information from the infrared and visible branches by generating spatial and channel attention maps to highlight vital information. These fused multi-scale features are reconstructed into the output image using residual upsampling blocks. A key contribution is the use of statistical measurements on the input images to quantify complementary information content, which is then used to adaptively weight the loss function terms that constrain intensity and gradient content in the output. This allows automatically balancing the retention of thermal targets versus visual details from the inputs. Experiments on standard datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation studies validate the importance of the dual attention fusion and the adaptive loss weighting based on complementary information measurement. Overall, the method effectively measures and integrates multi-scale complementary information from multimodal inputs to generate an informative fused representation.
