# [SuSana Distancia is all you need: Enforcing class separability in metric   learning via two novel distance-based loss functions for few-shot image   classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09062)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the main research questions and hypotheses addressed in this paper are:1) Is the Proto-Triplet Loss competitive with other metric-learning state-of-the-art models for few-shot image classification? 2) Is the novel ICNN Loss competitive with other metric-learning state-of-the-art models?3) How do the proposed loss functions (Proto-Triplet and ICNN) optimize the feature space to make the features more discriminating for few-shot image classification tasks?The central hypothesis seems to be that using distance-based loss functions that enforce class separability by minimizing intra-class distance and maximizing inter-class distance will allow the network to learn more useful feature representations that can better generalize to novel classes in few-shot scenarios.The experiments and results appear aimed at validating whether the proposed Proto-Triplet and ICNN losses allow the network to learn improved feature embeddings that lead to higher classification accuracy on few-shot tasks compared to other metric learning methods. The visualization of the optimized feature spaces provides further insight into how the losses affect embedding separability.In summary, this work introduces two novel loss functions for improving metric-based few-shot learning through enhancing class separability, and hypothesizes and tests whether they can enhance model performance on this challenging problem.
