# [Contrastive Decoding Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09117)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is whether Contrastive Decoding, a text generation method originally proposed for improving long-form text generation, can also improve the performance of large language models on reasoning tasks. The key hypothesis seems to be that Contrastive Decoding, which searches for strings that maximize the difference in likelihood between a stronger "expert" model and a weaker "amateur" model, can prevent reasoning errors and improve logical reasoning in large LMs. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that Contrastive Decoding will outperform greedy decoding for solving reasoning problems.The paper tests this hypothesis across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, including math word problems, commonsense reasoning, and multiple choice question answering. The results generally support the hypothesis, showing improved performance over greedy decoding and other baseline methods on tasks like arithmetic reasoning and multiple choice ranking.In summary, the central research question is whether Contrastive Decoding can enhance reasoning abilities in large LMs, and the key hypothesis is that it will outperform greedy decoding on logical reasoning tasks. The paper presents experiments across different models and datasets to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is showing that Contrastive Decoding, a simple text generation method, can improve the reasoning abilities of large language models. Specifically:- Contrastive Decoding improves performance on a variety of reasoning benchmarks, including math word problems (GSM8K) and commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag). It leads to state-of-the-art results on some tasks.- The gains occur across different model sizes, from 7B to 65B parameters, suggesting the method could benefit even larger models.- The authors analyze why Contrastive Decoding improves results. It seems to reduce surface-level copying from the input and prevent some reasoning errors. - Contrastive Decoding is efficient, providing gains with minimal computational overhead compared to other reasoning enhancement techniques.- The method works well for both open-ended generation (using sampling) and selecting answers for multiple choice questions. This makes it a flexible approach applicable to diverse tasks.Overall, Contrastive Decoding provides a simple but surprisingly effective way to improve reasoning in large language models, without requiring fine-tuning. The results suggest it could be a generally useful technique across models and tasks.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes Contrastive Decoding, a simple and computationally light text generation method that improves reasoning ability in large language models by searching for strings that maximize the difference in likelihood between a stronger expert model and a weaker amateur model.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in contrastive decoding and reasoning for large language models:- This paper shows strong improvements from using contrastive decoding for logical reasoning tasks like math word problems. Other works like DExperts and the original contrastive decoding paper focused more on open-ended text generation quality. So this paper expands the scope of tasks that contrastive decoding is useful for.- The gains on reasoning benchmarks like HellaSwag and GSM8K are very substantial, outperforming models with billions more parameters. Other reasoning enhancement methods like self-consistency and chain-of-thought prompting also help, but require more computation for smaller gains.- The analysis suggests contrastive decoding works by suppressing simpler reasoning modes like copying. This aligns with findings in the original contrastive decoding paper that it avoids generic or repetitive text. Overall, the method seems to work by accentuating more complex model behaviors.- The paper establishes general trends but does not do extensive hyperparameter tuning or test many model families. Follow-up work could do more comprehensive studies to establish broader conclusions about contrastive decoding across models, tasks, and hyperparameters. - There is still more exploration needed in how best to construct the amateur model and loss formulation. The paper shows small amateurs work best, but other formulations like anti-experts or intermediate checkpoints may work even better.Overall, the paper makes a strong case for contrastive decoding as a simple but high-impact method for improving reasoning in LLMs. It expands the scope of contrastive decoding and reinforces some hypothesized benefits, while leaving room for further analysis and improvements to the method. The results warrant expanded study of contrastive decoding given its potential.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Establishing scaling laws for contrastive decoding performance across different model sizes. The authors tested Contrastive Decoding primarily on models from the LLaMA family, and suggest more work is needed to definitively show the impact on larger models. - Distilling contrastive decoding performance into smaller models. The authors propose investigating knowledge distillation techniques to transfer the improvements from contrastive decoding in large models to smaller models.- Exploring different ways to create the amateur model, such as using fine-tuned models, anti-experts, or models with different tokenizers. The amateur model is a key component of contrastive decoding, and the authors suggest further exploration of how to construct optimal amateur models.- Creating better contrastive verifiers beyond using a smaller amateur model. The amateur model provides a simple contrastive signal, but more sophisticated verifier models could potentially improve results.- Analyzing the effect of contrastive decoding on commonsense reasoning tasks. The authors found mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, indicating more analysis is needed to understand when contrastive decoding helps or harms for these tasks.- Improving results on factual recall, where contrastive decoding currently degrades performance. Targeted improvements to the approach may help maintain factual accuracy.Overall, the main directions concern better understanding the scaling laws, transferring the benefits to smaller models, improving the contrastive signal, and adapting the approach to work well across both reasoning and factual tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes Contrastive Decoding, a simple and computationally efficient text generation method for improving reasoning and language understanding in large language models. Contrastive Decoding searches for strings that maximize the difference in likelihood between a strong "expert" model and a weaker "amateur" model. It was originally shown to improve the perceived quality of open-ended text generation, but this paper demonstrates it also achieves large improvements on reasoning benchmarks when used for decoding instead of standard greedy search. Experiments show Contrastive Decoding substantially outperforms greedy decoding across arithmetic reasoning tasks like GSM8K, enabling smaller models to match or exceed the performance of much larger models. It also improves performance on commonsense reasoning multiple choice datasets like HellaSwag, where Contrastive Decoding allows the 65B parameter LLaMA model to outperform all other models besides GPT-4. Analysis suggests the improvements come from Contrastive Decoding better preventing reasoning errors and surface-level copying compared to greedy decoding. The results demonstrate Contrastive Decoding's efficacy as a general purpose decoding method for improving language model performance on both reasoning and open-ended generation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes Contrastive Decoding, a simple text generation method that improves reasoning in large language models. Contrastive Decoding searches for strings that maximize the difference in likelihood between a stronger "expert" model and a weaker "amateur" model. It was originally shown to improve the quality of open-ended text generation, but this paper demonstrates it also enhances reasoning capabilities. The authors show Contrastive Decoding leads models like LLaMA-65B to substantially outperform greedy decoding across various reasoning benchmarks, including math word problems and commonsense reasoning tasks. For example, it improves LLaMA's accuracy on GSM8K math questions by up to 8 percentage points, outperforming even much larger models like PaLM-540B. Analysis suggests Contrastive Decoding works by reducing undesirable modes like repetitive text. Overall, Contrastive Decoding is a simple but effective technique to enhance reasoning in large language models for both text generation and question answering.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper proposes using Contrastive Decoding (CD) to improve reasoning ability in large language models (LLMs). CD searches for text that maximizes the weighted difference in likelihood between a strong "expert" model and a weaker "amateur" model. The idea is that the expert model will assign higher likelihood to coherent reasoning while the amateur model will not distinguish as clearly, so optimizing this difference accentuates the expert model's reasoning abilities. The authors show that using CD during decoding substantially improves the performance of various LLaMA models on math word problem benchmarks like GSM8K and commonsense reasoning benchmarks like HellaSwag, allowing LLaMA to outperform all other models on some tasks. The gains come from CD reducing superficial copying from the prompt and fewer dropped reasoning steps compared to greedy decoding. Overall, CD provides a unified decoding method that improves both reasoning and open-ended text generation across models.
