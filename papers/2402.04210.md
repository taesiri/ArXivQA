# ["Task Success" is not Enough: Investigating the Use of Video-Language   Models as Behavior Critics for Catching Undesirable Agent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04210)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large generative models like language models can produce meaningful candidate solutions, but often fail to satisfy constraints or user preferences in one shot. Their power is better harnessed when coupled with external critics/verifiers that provide feedback.  
- In embodied AI contexts, verification has focused on goal reachability rather than constraints beyond task success (e.g. robot should handle objects carefully). But given the scope of tasks, it's infeasible to manually specify verifiers. 
- Questions: Can video-language models (VLMs), which are approximately omniscient, act as Behavior Critics to catch undesirable but goal-reaching robot behaviors in videos? How to understand and utilize VLM critiques?

Methodology:
- Collect videos of robot manipulation tasks with goal-reaching yet unsafe/undersirable behaviors.
- Prompt VLMs (GPT-4V and Gemini Pro) to comment on undesirability in videos and provide pairwise trajectory preferences. 
- Benchmark to evaluate recall (coverage of human-labeled events) and precision (validity) of critiques.
- Manually categorize critique failure modes like visual grounding errors, causal errors.
- Experiment with providing grounding feedback to VLMs to refine critiques iteratively.

Contributions:
- First comprehensive study evaluating VLMs as open-domain Behavior Critics for robot tasks, with analysis of strengths/limitations.
- A benchmark with goal-reaching but undesirable robot manipulation videos across household tasks.
- Findings: GPT-4V identifies ~70% human-labeled events but has 62% precision. Visual grounding is a major limitation. Precision can be improved to 98% given perfect grounding feedback.
- Guidelines provided on effectively utilizing VLM critiques in embodied AI systems.

The paper demonstrates the promise of leveraging VLMs as critics to complement policy learning, while highlighting current limitations that need to be addressed regarding grounding accuracy. The analysis and benchmark serve as a valuable foundation for future work on integrating external AI feedback to make robot behaviors more safe and human-compatible.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper investigates using large vision and language models as scalable behavior critics to identify undesirable yet goal-reaching robot behaviors in videos, characterizes their strengths and limitations, and provides guidelines on effectively utilizing their critiques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The paper conducts the first comprehensive study on leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) like GPT-4V and Gemini Pro as behavior critics to freely comment on undesirable behaviors presented in videos of robots completing tasks. Specifically, the key contributions include:

1) Constructing a benchmark with videos showcasing diverse cases of goal-reaching yet undesirable robot policies in household tasks. 

2) Comprehensively evaluating VLM critics on this benchmark to understand their strengths and limitations in identifying undesirable behaviors. The evaluation focuses on metrics like recall, precision, and develops a taxonomy to characterize different failure modes.

3) Providing guidelines on how to effectively utilize VLM critiques based on the evaluation insights. This includes augmenting VLMs with specialized grounding modules and integrating critiques into a closed-loop system for iterative policy improvements.

4) Demonstrating a practical system that leverages VLM critiques to progressively refine policies generated by a Code-as-Policies agent on real robotic tasks.

In summary, this work investigates the feasibility of using VLMs as scalable behavior critics to catch overlooked undesirability, analyzes their output patterns, and showcases how they can complement policy learning systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes using video-language models (VLMs) as "behavior critics" to identify undesirable robot behaviors. What are some key advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to more traditional methods like hardcoded constraints or scripted verifiers? 

2. The paper finds that precision is a key challenge for VLM critics due to visual grounding limitations. What are some potential ways to improve the visual grounding capabilities of VLMs to make them more reliable behavior critics?

3. The authors propose augmenting VLM critics with specialized grounding modules and grounding feedback to refine outputs. What are some challenges in developing and integrating such grounding modules? What types of grounding information would be most valuable?  

4. What are some ways the benchmark dataset used in this paper could be expanded or improved to better evaluate VLM critics? What other metrics beyond recall and precision should be considered?

5. Could the taxonomy of errors developed in this paper be expanded? What other potential failure modes or limitations of VLM critics should be characterized? 

6. The authors demonstrate integrating VLM feedback into an iterative policy refinement loop with Code-as-Policies. What are some other policy learning frameworks that could leverage VLM critiques? What modifications would need to be made?

7. How sensitive are the performance metrics of VLM critics (recall, precision, etc.) to the way prompts are formulated? What are some best practices for prompt engineering when using VLMs as critics?

8. Could the critiques from VLM critics be used directly to expand the feature set for reward learning instead of just environment feedback? What are the tradeoffs?

9. The paper focuses on robot manipulation behaviors, but could this VLM critic approach work for other embodied AI domains like navigation or human-robot interaction? What changes would need to be made?

10. What steps would need to be taken to deploy and evaluate VLM critics on physical robots instead of just in simulation? What failure modes might emerge in the real world?
