# [Tractable Control for Autoregressive Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07438)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) be used to impose lexical constraints in autoregressive language generation models? 

The key idea is to use TPMs, which allow efficient inference, to guide autoregressive language models like GPT-2/3 during text generation, so that desired lexical constraints are satisfied. 

Specifically, the paper proposes GeLaTo, a framework where:

- A TPM (e.g. hidden Markov model) is trained to approximate the base autoregressive LM via maximum likelihood. 

- During text generation, the TPM provides token-level guidance by computing the probability Pr(x_{t+1} | x_{1:t}, α) of the next token efficiently, given the prefix x_{1:t} and lexical constraint α. 

- This guidance from the TPM is combined with the base LM's next-token distribution to generate the constrained text autoregressively.

The central hypothesis is that by using TPMs that allow tractable inference given lexical constraints, the proposed GeLaTo framework can reliably control autoregressive LMs to generate high-quality texts satisfying complex constraints. Experiments on constrained text generation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The key contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing GeLaTo, a framework for generating language with complex lexical constraints using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs). 

- Demonstrating how hidden Markov models (HMMs), as an example of TPMs, can be efficiently conditioned on conjunctive normal form constraints to provide token-level guidance for autoregressive generation. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is presented.

- Achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging lexical constrained text generation benchmarks like CommonGen, while guaranteeing 100% constraint satisfaction.

- Showing the potential of using TPMs to control large neural language models. The results motivate developing more expressive TPMs that can better approximate the distributions of large pre-trained LMs.

To summarize, the main novelty is in using TPMs, which support efficient logical inference, to impose lexical constraints in neural autoregressive text generation models like GPT-2. This allows controlling text generation to satisfy complex constraints, overcoming the intractability of conditioning on such constraints in neural models directly. The proposed framework GeLaTo demonstrates strong empirical results on constrained text generation tasks.

- This seems to be a standard conference paper formatting template, providing sections for the abstract, introduction, related work, experiments, and conclusions. It includes commonly used LaTeX packages for formatting, references, theorems, algorithms, etc.

- There is code for defining author lists and affiliations, suggesting this is intended for submission of peer-reviewed papers. 

- The template provides a framework for structuring papers, but does not present actual research content. To compare this template to other work, I would need to see papers written using it that describe specific contributions.

- The template itself does not represent research, but rather provides an outline and format for presenting research. Without seeing papers written using this template and their contributions, I cannot provide a meaningful comparison to other research.

In summary, this appears to be a standard formatting template for conference paper submissions.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests several future research directions:

- Developing more expressive tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) that can better approximate language models while still supporting efficient inference. The results showed a clear correlation between the approximation performance of the TPM and the final generation quality.

- Exploring different TPM architectures beyond hidden Markov models, such as arithmetic circuits and sum-product networks. The framework is general for any TPM.

- Applying the proposed framework to control other types of large neural networks beyond autoregressive language models, such as image generation models.

- Evaluating the framework on a broader range of constrained generation tasks and benchmark datasets.

- Investigating whether techniques from neuro-symbolic AI could help improve the integration of neural models with symbolic constraints.

- Studying how to automatically learn good lexical constraint representations for a given generation task.

- Scaling up the training of TPMs on larger amounts of data from pretrained LMs to achieve better approximation.

- Reducing the inference time of the framework while maintaining high performance.

In summary, the main future directions are developing more powerful TPMs, applying the framework to other tasks and models, and improving the efficiency and scalability of the approach. The key motivation is to leverage tractable probabilistic reasoning to reliably control complex neural generative models.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GeLaTo (Generating Language with Tractable constraints), a framework for imposing lexical constraints in autoregressive language generation models. It uses tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) to provide token-level guidance during generation from large pretrained language models like GPT. Specifically, it trains a TPM like a hidden Markov model to approximate the distribution of the pretrained LM. At generation time, it efficiently computes the probability of satisfying the lexical constraints with the TPM, and uses that to guide the token probabilities from the LM. This allows it to generate fluent text that is guaranteed to satisfy complex lexical constraints. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on constrained text generation benchmarks like CommonGen, significantly outperforming prior methods like search-based decoding and auxiliary neural models. A key advantage is that the TPM does not need retraining for different lexical constraints. The work shows the promise of using TPMs to control large LMs and motivates developing more expressive TPMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes GeLaTo, a method for controlling autoregressive language generation models using tractable probabilistic models. The key idea is to train a tractable probabilistic model (TPM) such as a hidden Markov model to approximate the distribution of a pretrained language model. At generation time, the TPM can efficiently compute conditional probabilities of the form Pr(x_{t+1} | x_{1:t}, α) where α represents lexical constraints on the generated text. By combining the conditional probabilities from the TPM and unconditional probabilities from the language model, text can be generated that satisfies complex lexical constraints. 

The paper demonstrates GeLaTo using hidden Markov models to control text generation from GPT-2. By encoding lexical constraints as conjunctive normal forms, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm can compute the relevant conditional probabilities from the HMM. Experiments on CommonGen, Yelp Reviews, and News datasets show GeLaTo achieves state-of-the-art performance in constrained text generation while guaranteeing 100% constraint satisfaction. The results highlight the potential of using tractable probabilistic models to control neural language models. The framework also motivates developing more expressive tractable models for natural language.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main method proposed is:

The paper presents GeLaTo (Generating Language with Tractable Constraints), a framework for controllable autoregressive text generation using tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) to impose lexical constraints in large language models. The key idea is to train a TPM to approximate the distribution of a pre-trained autoregressive language model (LM), such as GPT2. At inference time, the TPM can efficiently compute the conditional probability of the next token given the prefix and lexical constraint, which is intractable for the original LM. This conditional distribution is used to guide the LM to generate text satisfying the desired constraints. 

Specifically, the TPM training minimizes the KL-divergence between the TPM and LM via maximum likelihood. At inference, the next token probabilities from the TPM and LM are combined based on the setting (unsupervised vs. supervised). For unsupervised, they are multiplied as the TPM provides topical guidance. For supervised, they are geometrically averaged as both models are trained on the task. The resulting conditional distribution is decoded via beam search for constrained text generation.

The TPM framework allows imposing lexical constraints without retraining the model. The paper uses hidden Markov models as the TPM, and proposes an efficient dynamic programming algorithm for conditioning on conjunctive normal form constraints. Experiments on CommonGen and other datasets show GeLaTo achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of BLEU scores and other metrics while satisfying 100% of constraints.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main problem it is addressing is how to impose complex lexical constraints in autoregressive language generation models. Specifically, the paper points out that sampling from the conditional distribution P(text | α) where α is some lexical constraint (e.g. requiring certain keywords to appear) is intractable for autoregressive language models like GPT. This makes it challenging to control these large pre-trained models to generate text satisfying desired constraints. 

To address this problem, the paper proposes a framework called GeLaTo (Generating Language with Tractable Constraints) which uses tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) to guide autoregressive text generation while enforcing lexical constraints. The key ideas are:

1) Train a TPM to approximate the distribution of a pre-trained language model. 

2) At generation time, use the TPM to efficiently compute probabilities like P(x_{t+1} | x_{1:t}, α) to guide the language model's next token generation towards satisfying constraint α.

So in summary, the main problem is imposing lexical constraints in autoregressive text generation, and the proposed solution is using TPMs to efficiently reason about these constraints and guide the language model during generation.

This paper proposes GeLaTo, a framework to enable controllable text generation from autoregressive language models by leveraging tractable probabilistic models (TPMs). GeLaTo consists of two main steps: (1) training a TPM (e.g. hidden Markov model) to approximate the distribution of a pre-trained language model via maximum likelihood, and (2) at inference time, using the TPM to efficiently compute conditional probabilities for imposing lexical constraints, represented as conjunctive normal forms.
