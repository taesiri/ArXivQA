# [Toward Spatial Temporal Consistency of Joint Visual Tactile Perception   in VR Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16391)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Existing vibrotactile datasets for texture classification lack spatial information during data acquisition, making it difficult to achieve spatial-temporal consistency between visual and tactile signals. This limits the ability to provide realistic haptic feedback in VR applications when interacting with objects that have heterogeneous surface patterns.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors develop a new data acquisition system that collects vibrotactile signals using an accelerometer mounted on a robotic arm, along with synchronized capture of visual texture images. 

- The robotic arm moves in a predefined trajectory to scan different textured surfaces, recording spatial coordinates that are mapped to the acceleration data as well as pixels in the visual images. This establishes a mapping between taxels (tactile pixels) and visual pixels.

- The collected dataset contains 7 objects with varying textures - smooth, rough, flat, edged, etc. Both visual texture images and corresponding vibration maps are generated.

- Using this dataset, the authors build an interactive VR application called "V-Touching" that allows users to explore virtual textures and feel realistic haptics aligned with the visuals. Haptic glove input controls the virtual hand, while haptic feedback is rendered from the captured tactile data based on contact position and texture.

Main Contributions:
- A new scheme for spatially and temporally aligned collection of visual and vibrotactile signals by utilizing a robotic arm and accelerometer setup. 

- Vibration maps paired with visual texture images for 7 real objects exhibiting alignment between taxels and pixels.

- An interactive VR application "V-Touching" that demonstrates realistic and consistent visuo-haptic texture exploration leveraging the collected multimodal dataset.

In summary, the key novelty is in enabling spatial-temporal consistency between visual and haptic modalities for virtual textures, through a purpose-built data acquisition system and dataset. The VR application showcases lifelike haptic rendering aligned with visual textures.
