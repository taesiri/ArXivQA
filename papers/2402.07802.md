# [Towards a mathematical theory for consistency training in diffusion   models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07802)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models can generate high-quality samples but require many neural network evaluations during sampling, limiting their efficiency. Consistency models were proposed to enable single-step sampling while maintaining sample quality.

- Despite empirical success of consistency models, there is little theoretical understanding of how well they can match the target distribution with few steps of consistency training. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper studies an iterative consistency training procedure that learns a sequence of functions to map points along the diffusion trajectory back to the data distribution.

- They analyze how errors propagate in this procedure and characterize how many steps are needed to guarantee the samples match the target distribution up to a desired accuracy.

Main Contributions:
- Proves that with $T = \tilde{O}(d^{5/2}/\varepsilon)$ steps of consistency training and small optimization error, the samples will be within $2\varepsilon$ of the target distribution in 1-Wasserstein distance.

- Provides first theoretical guarantee on sample quality from consistency training, giving insights into its validity and revealing dependence on key factors like dimension $d$ and target accuracy $\varepsilon$. 

- Framework for studying error propagation in consistency models could be extended to other generative distillation methods like progressive distillation.

- Results theoretically justify ability of consistency models to produce high-fidelity samples in just one step, illuminating their power for efficient sampling.

In summary, the paper makes an important first step in theoretically understanding consistency models, revealing how many steps of training are sufficient to ensure a desired level of sample quality. The analysis helps validate consistency models and sheds light on their efficacy for one-shot sampling.
