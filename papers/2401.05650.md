# [On Detecting Cherry-picking in News Coverage Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05650)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Cherry-picking refers to the deliberate selection of facts that support one viewpoint while omitting facts that support the opposing viewpoint. It is a form of bias and misinformation in news media. 
- Manually identifying cherry-picked statements in news articles is challenging, especially when the opposing viewpoint's story is not present.
- This paper introduces the problem of automatically detecting cherry-picking in news articles by finding missing important statements.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes Cherry, an approach that utilizes the analysis of news coverage from multiple sources to identify cherry-picking. 
- It relies on language models (BERT and Longformer) that consider contextual information from other news sources to classify statements based on their importance to the event covered in the target news story.

Main Contributions:
- Formulates the problem of detecting cherry-picking computationally.
- Proposes a novel end-to-end cherry-picking detection approach that incorporates contextual information.
- Introduces a new dataset specifically designed for cherry-picking detection, used to train and evaluate the models.
- Achieves 89% F-1 score in detecting important statements using the best performing model.
- Shows the importance of incorporating external knowledge from alternative unbiased narratives when assessing a statement's importance.

In summary, this is the first study that addresses the detection of cherry-picking in text using computational methods. The proposed approach and new dataset advance research in analyzing bias and misinformation in news media.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces Cherry, a novel approach for automatically detecting cherry-picked statements in news articles by finding missing important statements using language models that consider contextual information from other news sources to assess a statement's importance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The formulation and modeling of the problem of detecting cherry-picking in text from a computational perspective. The paper defines key concepts like events, documents, statements, and formulates the problem of finding missing important statements from a document as a computational problem.

2) The novel end-to-end cherry-picking detection approach that incorporates contextual information from alternative news sources covering the same event. The approach relies on supervised models like BERT and Longformer to assess a statement's importance based on this contextual information. 

3) The introduction of a new cherry-picking detection dataset specifically designed for this problem, which contains over 3,000 examples of statements, neutral event context, and importance labels. This dataset was used to train and evaluate the models.

4) Promising experimental results that show the top-performing model achieves an F-1 score of about 89% in detecting important statements on unseen data. The experiments also demonstrate the value of incorporating external contextual knowledge in assessing statement importance.

In summary, the main contribution is the computational formulation of the cherry-picking detection problem, the proposed approach relying on contextual information, the new dataset, and the promising initial results - being the first known study to address cherry-picking detection computationally.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Cherry-picking - referring to the deliberate selection of certain facts or evidence that support a particular viewpoint while ignoring or distorting facts that support the opposing perspective. This is a key concept that the paper aims to detect automatically.

- Media bias - the paper discusses how cherry-picking is a device that can introduce and aid bias in news reporting. Detecting cherry-picking can help reveal certain forms of media bias.

- Statement importance - the paper models cherry-picking detection as assessing the importance of statements to events covered in news stories. Important statements that are omitted constitute cherry-picking.

- Contextual information - the approach relies on incorporating contextual information from other news sources covering the same event to evaluate statement importance and cherry-picking. 

- Language models - BERT and Longformer language models are trained to predict statement importance based on contextual information.

- Dataset - a novel cherry-picking detection dataset is introduced to train and evaluate the models.

- Underemphasis - the current focus is on detecting cherry-picking through the underemphasis or omission of important statements.

- Accuracy, F1-score - evaluation metrics used to assess model performance in detecting statement importance and cherry-picking.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper mentions using DBSCAN to cluster articles into events. What are some limitations of using a density-based clustering algorithm like DBSCAN for this task compared to other clustering techniques? How could the clustering be improved?

2. The paper collects statement importance labels from human annotators. What steps were taken to reduce annotator bias and subjectivity? How else could annotator bias be minimized? 

3. The paper tests both BERT and Longformer models. Why is Longformer better suited for the task than BERT? What specifically about the Longformer architecture makes it advantageous?

4. The paper finds longer contexts improve performance up to a point before declining. What underlying reasons could explain this pattern? How could the context selection be optimized? 

5. The paper applies global attention to different combinations of tokens. Why does applying global attention to just the statement and classification tokens maintain high performance? What is the tradeoff?

6. The end-to-end pipeline relies on semantic similarity thresholds at multiple stages. How sensitive is overall performance to these threshold values? How can they be properly tuned?

7. The paper focuses on detecting cherry-picking by underemphasis. What modifications would be needed to detect overemphasis instead? What additional challenges might overemphasis detection introduce?

8. How exactly is the event context collected and preprocessed before being fed into the models? What steps help ensure it represents an unbiased perspective? 

9. The paper finds only a moderate correlation between automated cherry-picking scores and external bias ratings. What factors contribute to this less than perfect alignment? How could it be improved?

10. The data collection process involves multiple stages of clustering and segmentation. What risks exist of propagating errors from one stage to the next? How could pipeline robustness be improved?
