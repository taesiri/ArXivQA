# CLARA: Classifying and Disambiguating User Commands for Reliable   Interactive Robotic Agents

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we enhance the reliability of interactive robot agents that utilize large language models (LLMs) by properly handling ambiguous or infeasible user commands?Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called CLARA (CLAssifying and disAambiguating user commands for reliable Robotic Agents) that aims to:1. Classify user commands as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible based on estimating uncertainty from the LLM.2. Disambiguate ambiguous commands by interacting with the user via question generation. 3. Incorporate situational awareness when classifying commands as ambiguous vs. infeasible.The key hypothesis appears to be that explicitly modeling and handling uncertainty in LLM predictions for robot agents will allow for more reliable human-robot interaction by avoiding undesired actions from ambiguous or infeasible commands. The proposed CLARA method incorporates uncertainty estimation, situational awareness, and disambiguation to address this problem.In summary, the central research question is how to make interactive robots powered by LLMs more reliable by properly interpreting uncertain user commands. The hypothesis is that modeling uncertainty and disambiguating commands will enhance reliability. CLARA is presented as a method to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a method to classify user commands as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible in interactive robotic agents that use large language models (LLMs). This involves estimating uncertainty in the LLM to recognize ambiguous/infeasible commands, and using situational awareness to further classify uncertain commands.2. Introducing an approach to disambiguate ambiguous commands by interacting with users via question generation using the LLM in a zero-shot manner. 3. Presenting a dataset called "Situational Awareness for Goal Classification in Robotic Tasks (SaGC)" which contains pairs of commands, scene descriptions, and uncertainty labels to evaluate situational awareness.4. Validating the proposed methods on the SaGC dataset, in pick-and-place simulations, and through real-world human-robot interaction experiments for handing over objects.The key ideas seem to be using uncertainty estimation and situational awareness with LLMs to classify unclear user commands, and leveraging the LLMs in a zero-shot way for disambiguation via natural interaction. The dataset and experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the viability of the approach.In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing and evaluating methods to handle uncertain/ambiguous commands for more reliable human-robot interaction using LLMs. The proposed techniques aim to classify commands and interactively disambiguate them when needed.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work in human-robot interaction and language grounding:- The main contribution is developing a method to classify user commands for robots as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible using uncertainty estimation and situational awareness with large language models (LLMs). This builds on prior work using LLMs for robotic planning, but focuses more on handling uncertain commands.- For ambiguity detection, the entropy/uncertainty based approach is common. But this paper proposes specific techniques like context sampling and uncertainty-aware prompting to better leverage uncertainty estimates from LLMs.- Disambiguating unclear commands via interaction is explored in other works, but this paper presents a more flexible approach by generating clarification questions directly with the LLM in a zero-shot manner, rather than relying on templates.- The idea of situational awareness for goal feasibility checking is novel compared to prior interactive robot systems. The use of LLMs allows assessing feasibility based on the environment in a more generalizable way.- The new dataset for goal classification with situational context provides a valuable benchmark for this problem, whereas most prior datasets focus on grounding commands for a fixed robot capability.- Overall, the proposed system CLARA demonstrates stronger performance on uncertainty estimation and goal classification compared to baseline approaches, showing the benefits of the techniques introduced.- A limitation is the reliance on zero-shot prompting with LLMs, rather than fine-tuning models. But the authors argue this better highlights their contributions around uncertainty modeling and situational awareness.In summary, this paper pushes forward research on handling ambiguous language and uncertainty for interactive agents, using LLMs more extensively along with novel prompting strategies and evaluation data. The results validate the robustness benefits of their proposed methods.
