# CLARA: Classifying and Disambiguating User Commands for Reliable
  Interactive Robotic Agents

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we enhance the reliability of interactive robot agents that utilize large language models (LLMs) by properly handling ambiguous or infeasible user commands?Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called CLARA (CLAssifying and disAambiguating user commands for reliable Robotic Agents) that aims to:1. Classify user commands as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible based on estimating uncertainty from the LLM.2. Disambiguate ambiguous commands by interacting with the user via question generation. 3. Incorporate situational awareness when classifying commands as ambiguous vs. infeasible.The key hypothesis appears to be that explicitly modeling and handling uncertainty in LLM predictions for robot agents will allow for more reliable human-robot interaction by avoiding undesired actions from ambiguous or infeasible commands. The proposed CLARA method incorporates uncertainty estimation, situational awareness, and disambiguation to address this problem.In summary, the central research question is how to make interactive robots powered by LLMs more reliable by properly interpreting uncertain user commands. The hypothesis is that modeling uncertainty and disambiguating commands will enhance reliability. CLARA is presented as a method to achieve this.
