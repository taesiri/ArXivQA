# [CLARA: Classifying and Disambiguating User Commands for Reliable   Interactive Robotic Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10376)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we enhance the reliability of interactive robot agents that utilize large language models (LLMs) by properly handling ambiguous or infeasible user commands?Specifically, the paper proposes an approach called CLARA (CLAssifying and disAambiguating user commands for reliable Robotic Agents) that aims to:1. Classify user commands as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible based on estimating uncertainty from the LLM.2. Disambiguate ambiguous commands by interacting with the user via question generation. 3. Incorporate situational awareness when classifying commands as ambiguous vs. infeasible.The key hypothesis appears to be that explicitly modeling and handling uncertainty in LLM predictions for robot agents will allow for more reliable human-robot interaction by avoiding undesired actions from ambiguous or infeasible commands. The proposed CLARA method incorporates uncertainty estimation, situational awareness, and disambiguation to address this problem.In summary, the central research question is how to make interactive robots powered by LLMs more reliable by properly interpreting uncertain user commands. The hypothesis is that modeling uncertainty and disambiguating commands will enhance reliability. CLARA is presented as a method to achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper appear to be:1. Proposing a method to classify user commands as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible in interactive robotic agents that use large language models (LLMs). This involves estimating uncertainty in the LLM to recognize ambiguous/infeasible commands, and using situational awareness to further classify uncertain commands.2. Introducing an approach to disambiguate ambiguous commands by interacting with users via question generation using the LLM in a zero-shot manner. 3. Presenting a dataset called "Situational Awareness for Goal Classification in Robotic Tasks (SaGC)" which contains pairs of commands, scene descriptions, and uncertainty labels to evaluate situational awareness.4. Validating the proposed methods on the SaGC dataset, in pick-and-place simulations, and through real-world human-robot interaction experiments for handing over objects.The key ideas seem to be using uncertainty estimation and situational awareness with LLMs to classify unclear user commands, and leveraging the LLMs in a zero-shot way for disambiguation via natural interaction. The dataset and experiments in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate the viability of the approach.In summary, the main contribution appears to be developing and evaluating methods to handle uncertain/ambiguous commands for more reliable human-robot interaction using LLMs. The proposed techniques aim to classify commands and interactively disambiguate them when needed.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Based on my review, here are some key ways this paper compares to other related work in human-robot interaction and language grounding:- The main contribution is developing a method to classify user commands for robots as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible using uncertainty estimation and situational awareness with large language models (LLMs). This builds on prior work using LLMs for robotic planning, but focuses more on handling uncertain commands.- For ambiguity detection, the entropy/uncertainty based approach is common. But this paper proposes specific techniques like context sampling and uncertainty-aware prompting to better leverage uncertainty estimates from LLMs.- Disambiguating unclear commands via interaction is explored in other works, but this paper presents a more flexible approach by generating clarification questions directly with the LLM in a zero-shot manner, rather than relying on templates.- The idea of situational awareness for goal feasibility checking is novel compared to prior interactive robot systems. The use of LLMs allows assessing feasibility based on the environment in a more generalizable way.- The new dataset for goal classification with situational context provides a valuable benchmark for this problem, whereas most prior datasets focus on grounding commands for a fixed robot capability.- Overall, the proposed system CLARA demonstrates stronger performance on uncertainty estimation and goal classification compared to baseline approaches, showing the benefits of the techniques introduced.- A limitation is the reliance on zero-shot prompting with LLMs, rather than fine-tuning models. But the authors argue this better highlights their contributions around uncertainty modeling and situational awareness.In summary, this paper pushes forward research on handling ambiguous language and uncertainty for interactive agents, using LLMs more extensively along with novel prompting strategies and evaluation data. The results validate the robustness benefits of their proposed methods.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Improving situational awareness and incorporating more environmental context into the model. The authors suggest enhancing the situational awareness of the agent by utilizing more advanced computer vision systems and knowledge about the environment. This could help the agent better understand the feasibility and ambiguity of goals based on the objects, people, and other contextual factors present.- Exploring different methods for uncertainty estimation. The authors propose a sampling-based approach for estimating uncertainty from large language models. They suggest investigating other techniques like Bayesian deep learning models or different metrics for measuring variation in generated text.- Fine-tuning the models for explanation generation. The authors note that their zero-shot approach for generating explanations of uncertainty and questions could be improved by collecting explanation data and fine-tuning the language models. This could lead to higher quality and more diverse explanations.- Incorporating user feedback. The authors discuss using user responses to questions to reduce ambiguity and uncertainty. More work could be done on effectively utilizing this feedback to update the model's situational awareness and goals. - Evaluating on more complex tasks. The experiments were limited to relatively simple tabletop pick-and-place and handover scenarios. Testing the approach on more complex real-world human-robot interaction tasks is suggested.- Addressing other failure modes. The authors describe some limitations around vision failures and insufficient situational understanding. Improving the robustness of the full system could help address these failure modes.In summary, the key directions are enhancing situational awareness, improving uncertainty estimation, leveraging fine-tuning and user feedback, evaluating on more complex tasks, and addressing limitations like vision failures to make the system more robust. The authors lay out promising future work to build on their proposed approach.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper presents CLARA, a method for classifying and disambiguating user commands for reliable interactive robotic agents that utilize large language models (LLMs). The goal is to classify commands as clear, ambiguous, or infeasible to enhance reliability and avoid malfunctions. The method first estimates predictive uncertainty of the LLM to classify commands as clear or uncertain (ambiguous/infeasible). For uncertain commands, it checks feasibility with situational awareness from the LLM's zero-shot ability to further classify them as ambiguous or infeasible. For ambiguous commands, it interacts with users via LLM-generated questions to disambiguate the commands. The authors introduce a dataset called SaGC for evaluating situation-aware uncertainty classification. Experiments validate the approach on this dataset, in pick-and-place simulations, and real-world human-robot handover scenarios. The method effectively quantifies uncertainty from LLMs and classifies command types. The interaction module also helps disambiguate ambiguous commands. Properly recognizing command types is shown to enhance reliability in interactive robotic agents utilizing LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper proposes CLARA, a method for classifying and disambiguating user commands for reliable interactive robotic agents that utilize large language models (LLMs). The key ideas are:1) Estimating uncertainty in LLM predictions to identify ambiguous or infeasible user commands. This is done by sampling the context and measuring variance in the LLM's outputs. Commands with high variance are classified as uncertain. 2) For uncertain commands, using the LLM's situational reasoning abilities in a zero-shot manner to distinguish between ambiguous and infeasible goals. Ambiguous goals are then disambiguated by generating questions to gather more info from the user. The method is evaluated on a new dataset called SaGC designed to assess situation-aware uncertainty, as well as in pick-and-place simulations and real-world human-robot interaction experiments. Results show the approach can effectively quantify uncertainty, distinguish between clear, ambiguous and infeasible commands, and disambiguate ambiguous goals via interaction. The authors highlight the ability to enhance reliability in LLM-based interactive agents by detecting and handling uncertain user commands.In summary, this paper introduces a novel approach for classifying and clarifying uncertain user inputs in LLM-based interactive robots. Key contributions include uncertainty estimation, zero-shot classification, a new evaluation dataset, and demonstrations showing improved reliability in human-robot interaction scenarios.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method proposed in the paper:The paper introduces CLARA, a method for classifying and disambiguating user commands for reliable interactive robotic agents that utilize large language models (LLMs). CLARA first estimates the uncertainty of the LLM's predictions on a given user command, in order to determine if the command is clear or uncertain (ambiguous or infeasible). For uncertain commands, CLARA leverages the LLM's situational awareness to classify the command as either ambiguous or infeasible in a zero-shot manner. For ambiguous commands, CLARA generates follow-up questions using the LLM to interactively disambiguate the command by gathering additional information from the user. A key aspect of CLARA is the use of uncertainty estimation and situational awareness with LLMs to enhance reliability by properly interpreting uncertain user commands. The method is evaluated on a new dataset for situational goal classification, pick-and-place simulations, and real-world human-robot interaction scenarios.
