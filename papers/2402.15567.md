# [Foundation Policies with Hilbert Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15567)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Finding scalable and effective ways to pre-train reinforcement learning policies in an unsupervised, offline manner remains an open challenge. Prior offline pre-training objectives like behavioral cloning, goal-conditioned RL, and unsupervised skill discovery have limitations in terms of data requirements, behavior diversity, or versatility for downstream tasks. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes Hilbert Foundation Policies (HILPs), a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train policies that capture diverse, long-horizon behaviors from offline data. The key ideas are:

1) Learn a Hilbert state representation that preserves temporal distances between states. This representation maps temporally similar states to spatially similar latent states.

2) Train a latent-conditioned policy to optimally "span" the latent space using an inner product-based intrinsic reward. This results in behaviors that can move long distances in any direction.

3) The latent-conditioned policy can be efficiently adapted to new tasks in a zero-shot manner via prompting the policy with reward functions or goals. The inner product structure also enables test-time planning.

Main Contributions:

- Introduction of HILPs, a new versatile policy pre-training framework that subsumes prior offline GCRL methods and enables zero-shot RL.

- Using Hilbert representations to capture temporal structure and enabling efficient prompting strategies.

- Empirical demonstration that a single HILP model can outperform prior state-of-the-art methods specialized for zero-shot RL, offline GCRL, and hierarchical RL across 7 simulated robotic environments.

The main benefit of HILPs is efficiently learning a variety of long-horizon behaviors that facilitate rapid downstream task adaptation, without needing online data collection or additional training. The structured representations also enable test-time planning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

This paper proposes Hilbert foundation policies (HILPs), a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies from unlabeled data by learning a structured state representation that captures temporal distances and then spanning the induced latent space with directional movements to solve downstream tasks efficiently via zero-shot prompting.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is to introduce Hilbert foundation policies (HILPs), which is a new objective to pre-train diverse policies from offline data that can be efficiently adapted to various downstream tasks. Specifically, HILPs are able to capture diverse, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline datasets, and can be prompted in a zero-shot manner to solve tasks like goal-conditioned RL and zero-shot RL without any additional training.

The paper introduces Hilbert foundation policies (HILPs) as a novel framework for unsupervised pre-training of diverse policies from offline data.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes learning a Hilbert representation that preserves temporal distances between states. What are the limitations of relying on a symmetric distance metric when temporal distances may be asymmetric in practice? How could the method be extended to handle asymmetry?

2. The paper shows both theoretically and empirically that directional movements in the latent Hilbert space correspond to optimal actions for goal reaching. However, what assumptions need to hold for this result? When might this approach fail in practice? 

3. The inner product reward used for policy learning encourages spanning the state space. However, how much coverage of the state space is actually needed in practice? Could a more selective strategy for choosing directions lead to better sample efficiency?

4. For test-time planning, the paper uses a simple nearest neighbor search to find midpoints. Could more sophisticated planning algorithms like rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) allow for better refinement of subgoals?

5. The method is model-free and relies solely on offline data. However, how could model-based planning be incorporated during pre-training and test-time adaptation to further improve performance?

6. The zero-shot prompting strategies are simple and efficient but may not always yield optimal solutions. What are the tradeoffs between zero-shot prompting vs fine-tuning for task adaptation? Under what conditions would fine-tuning be preferred?

7. For visual domains, the method operates directly on pixels. How does the high dimensionality affect learning of the Hilbert embedding? Could incorporation of state-of-the-art visual representation learning techniques further improve performance?

8. The paper demonstrates strong performance on simulated robotic control tasks. What additional challenges need to be addressed to apply the method to real-world robotic learning?

9. The method combines ideas from goal-conditioned RL, successor features, and unsupervised skill discovery. What other synergistic combinations with existing methods could further improve the diversity and scalability of the learned behaviors? 

10. What types of behaviors are inherently difficult for this method to capture, given its reliance on an isometric embedding? Are there complementary approaches that could handle more complex, hierarchical behaviors?
