# [On provable privacy vulnerabilities of graph representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04033)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
The paper investigates the structural vulnerabilities in graph neural network (GNN) models where sensitive topological information can be inferred through edge reconstruction attacks. In particular, it focuses on analyzing cosine-similarity-based edge reconstruction attacks (COSERA) both theoretically and empirically. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper makes three key contributions:

1. It establishes theoretical and empirical results characterizing the success conditions of COSERA when applied to sparse Erdős–Rényi graphs. It shows COSERA can achieve perfect reconstruction as graph size increases, even without relying on feature similarity. 

2. It reveals limitations of COSERA on dense stochastic block models, proving reconstruction is fundamentally hard when intra-group connection probability is Θ(1). This delineates failure modes of the attack.

3. It explores using COSERA to audit the privacy-utility trade-off of provably private graph representations produced via noisy aggregation (NAG). It identifies cases where NAG offers protection against COSERA even when its formal privacy guarantee is vacuous.

Main Contributions:

- Theoretical articulation of success and failure modes of COSERA based on graph properties like sparsity and block structure. 

- Empirical validation on synthetic and real-world graphs showing conditions where COSERA succeeds or fails.

- Demonstration of using COSERA to audit privacy-preserving GNN models, revealing its competencies and limitations as an auditing tool.

The paper contributes towards a principled understanding of structural vulnerabilities of GNN representations against similarity-based attacks like COSERA.
