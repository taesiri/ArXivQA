# [Counterfactual Fairness Is Not Demographic Parity, and Other   Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper is motivated by a recent AAAI 2023 paper by Rosenblatt and Witter that claims equivalence between counterfactual fairness and demographic parity. The author argues this claim is based on misunderstandings about counterfactual fairness and sets out to clarify common misconceptions.

Proposed Solution/Contributions:  
- Counterfactual fairness and demographic parity are not equivalent, neither concept implies the other. Strong causal assumptions may create inconsequential cases of equivalence but these break down in general.

- Ancestral closure of protected attributes is not an inherent requirement of counterfactual fairness, the original definition allows for use of causal ancestors of protected attributes in constructing the predictor.

- Counterfactual fairness is agnostic to loss functions or other constraints, it acts as a variable selection method to determine allowable information. Optimal predictors can then be constructed respecting counterfactual fairness constraints. 

- The paper provides counterexamples showing demographic parity does not imply counterfactual fairness, even under strong causal assumptions like one-dimensional error terms. More general stochastic process models further break down such limited cases of equivalence.

- Path-specific variants of counterfactual fairness are highlighted as more flexible than total effect versions. These allow blocking specific causal paths from protected attributes.

- The paper clarifies common misconceptions in other papers misunderstanding counterfactual fairness, like requiring ancestral closure of protected attributes. It also highlights how counterfactual fairness is designed for constructing fair predictors, not just diagnosing existing unfairness.

In summary, the paper leverages counterexamples and clarifications to demonstrate counterfactual fairness and demographic parity are fundamentally distinct concepts, not interchangeable. It also aims to broadly dispel misunderstandings about requirements and applications of counterfactual fairness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper clarifies common misunderstandings about counterfactual fairness, explains why it is not equivalent to demographic parity, and addresses broader issues related to the meaning and application of counterfactual fairness.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is to clarify misunderstandings about the concept of counterfactual fairness and its relationship to other fairness notions like demographic parity. Specifically:

- The paper shows through counterexamples that counterfactual fairness does not imply or require demographic parity, contrary to claims made in some recent papers. The author explains why equivalences that seemed to hold under narrow assumptions generally break down.

- The paper reiterates that counterfactual fairness was proposed as an individual fairness notion, not a group fairness notion as sometimes portrayed. The author clarifies the meaning of the notation and definitions used. 

- The paper highlights that counterfactual fairness provides a way to select fair information for use in predictors, separate from choices about loss functions or constraints. It does not by itself resolve tensions between different fairness desiderata. 

- The author clarifies that ancestral closure of protected attributes, while sometimes reasonable, is not an inherent requirement of counterfactual fairness.

Overall, the paper aims to correct misunderstandings about counterfactual fairness and clearly distinguish it from related fairness concepts, through counterexamples and clarification of the original definitions and goals. This serves to refine the discussion and application of counterfactual fairness in algorithmic fairness research.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Counterfactual fairness - The main concept that the paper focuses on, referring to a notion of fairness for machine learning models based on causal reasoning and potential outcomes. 

- Demographic parity - A probabilistic, non-causal notion of group fairness that the paper examines in relation to counterfactual fairness.

- Causal models - The paper relies heavily on causal modeling concepts like structural causal models, do-calculus, ignorability assumptions, etc.

- Individual vs group fairness - The paper argues that counterfactual fairness is an individual fairness notion, not a group notion like demographic parity.

- Path-specific effects - Variants of counterfactual fairness that allow including descendants of protected attributes along certain causal paths.

- Selection bias - Issues related to sample selection and ignorability that can undermine causal assumptions.

- Notation - The paper discusses ambiguities and inconsistencies in notation for counterfactuals and potential outcomes.

- Misunderstandings - Several misunderstandings or mischaracterizations of counterfactual fairness from other papers are clarified.

In summary, counterfactual fairness, causal assumptions, individual/group fairness, and clarifications of common misunderstandings are the key themes. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the counterfactual fairness method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that counterfactual fairness and demographic parity are not equivalent in general. Can you provide an intuitive explanation for why this is the case? What key assumptions need to hold for them to coincide?

2. Path-specific counterfactual fairness is mentioned in the paper but not elaborated on in detail. Can you explain the key ideas behind path-specific counterfactual fairness and how it differs from the original proposal? 

3. The paper discusses issues around ancestral closure of protected attributes in defining counterfactual fairness. What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of requiring ancestral closure? Under what conditions might we want to enforce it or avoid enforcing it?

4. Partial identifiability is suggested as an approach when path-specific counterfactual fairness assumptions are difficult to justify. Can you explain the idea of partial identification in this context? How might it help address some of the challenges with path-specific counterfactual fairness?

5. The paper argues counterfactual fairness is agnostic to the choice of loss function. Could adhering strictly to counterfactual fairness ever lead to problems in real-world systems? If so, can you give examples?

6. What are some of the key challenges in specifying the necessary causal assumptions to apply counterfactual fairness? How reasonable is it to expect practitioners to correctly formalize these assumptions in applied settings?

7. The paper discusses the difficulty of distinguishing between variables that represent protected attributes versus other observed variables. What approaches could help determine if a variable qualifies as a protected attribute?

8. How does counterfactual fairness account for the potential benefits or harms that arise from using certain variables in prediction versus excluding them? Are any additional ethical considerations needed here?  

9. One critique of counterfactual fairness is that equivalent models can imply different feasible fair predictors. How concerning is this? Are there ways to address it within the counterfactual fairness framework?

10. What are some of the biggest open challenges in applying counterfactual fairness ideas to real-world prediction problems? Are there important practical limitations that still need to be addressed?
