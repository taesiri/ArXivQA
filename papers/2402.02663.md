# [Counterfactual Fairness Is Not Demographic Parity, and Other   Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper is motivated by a recent AAAI 2023 paper by Rosenblatt and Witter that claims equivalence between counterfactual fairness and demographic parity. The author argues this claim is based on misunderstandings about counterfactual fairness and sets out to clarify common misconceptions.

Proposed Solution/Contributions:  
- Counterfactual fairness and demographic parity are not equivalent, neither concept implies the other. Strong causal assumptions may create inconsequential cases of equivalence but these break down in general.

- Ancestral closure of protected attributes is not an inherent requirement of counterfactual fairness, the original definition allows for use of causal ancestors of protected attributes in constructing the predictor.

- Counterfactual fairness is agnostic to loss functions or other constraints, it acts as a variable selection method to determine allowable information. Optimal predictors can then be constructed respecting counterfactual fairness constraints. 

- The paper provides counterexamples showing demographic parity does not imply counterfactual fairness, even under strong causal assumptions like one-dimensional error terms. More general stochastic process models further break down such limited cases of equivalence.

- Path-specific variants of counterfactual fairness are highlighted as more flexible than total effect versions. These allow blocking specific causal paths from protected attributes.

- The paper clarifies common misconceptions in other papers misunderstanding counterfactual fairness, like requiring ancestral closure of protected attributes. It also highlights how counterfactual fairness is designed for constructing fair predictors, not just diagnosing existing unfairness.

In summary, the paper leverages counterexamples and clarifications to demonstrate counterfactual fairness and demographic parity are fundamentally distinct concepts, not interchangeable. It also aims to broadly dispel misunderstandings about requirements and applications of counterfactual fairness.
