# [Upscale-A-Video: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Real-World   Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06640)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes Upscale-A-Video, a novel text-guided latent diffusion framework for real-world video super-resolution (VSR). It introduces a local-global temporal strategy consisting of finetuned temporal U-Net and VAE-decoder locally and a training-free recurrent latent propagation module globally to maintain both fine-grained and long-term temporal consistency. Leveraging the generative prior encapsulated in a pretrained image diffusion model, it avoids heavy training and exhibits improved performance in producing realistic details compared to CNN-based methods. Further, it allows using text prompts to guide texture details and adjusting noise levels to balance restoration and generation, achieving a trade-off between fidelity and quality. Trained on WebVid10M and a newly collected high-quality YouHQ dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse VSR benchmarks. Both quantitative metrics and user study demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in restoring fidelity and enhancing perceptual quality with more faithful details and coherence.
