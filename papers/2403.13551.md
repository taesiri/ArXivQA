## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Ground-A-Score: Scaling Up the Score Distillation for Multi-Attribute Editing":

Problem:
Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can generate and edit images based on text prompts. However, when prompts require multiple attributes to be edited simultaneously, these models often fail to reflect all attribute changes or cause undesired changes to unaffected regions. This stems from the text encoder bottleneck when handling complex prompts and inconsistent gradients from the score distillation process.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes Ground-A-Score, a model-agnostic pipeline to scale up score distillation for multi-attribute image editing. It breaks down complex prompts into subtasks to get accurate gradients from a T2I diffusion model. These gradients are aggregated with grounding-based masking and regularization for stability. Additional components automate prompt preparation and prevent object erosion.

Key Contributions:
- Subtask decomposition during score distillation to ease text encoder load and get reliable gradients per edit.
- Grounding-based gradient aggregation with masking and full prompt guidance to enable coherent multi-attribute edits. 
- Null-text penalty to prevent undesired object erosion from unreliable gradients.
- Automated pipeline with multimodal LLM and zero-shot grounding for prompt creation and localization.

The method reflects intricate details of complex prompts more precisely than existing approaches while preserving unrelated regions. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm Ground-A-Score's effectiveness for multi-attribute editing over baselines.
