# [Fastformer: Additive Attention Can Be All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09084)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we design an efficient Transformer model that can effectively model long text sequences?

The key points are:

- Standard Transformer models have quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length due to the self-attention mechanism. This makes them inefficient for long sequences.

- Prior efficient Transformer variants using sparse attention or low-rank approximations have limitations in fully capturing global contexts or being efficient enough on very long sequences.

- This paper proposes Fastformer, an efficient Transformer variant based on additive attention, which can model long sequences with linear complexity while capturing contextual information effectively. 

- The core ideas are using additive attention to summarize the query and key matrices into global vectors, and modeling the interactions between global vectors and individual token vectors via element-wise product.

- Experiments on various tasks like text classification, news recommendation, and summarization show Fastformer is much more efficient than Transformer baselines while achieving competitive accuracy on long sequences.

In summary, the central hypothesis is that using additive attention and element-wise products for global-local interactions can enable both efficiency and accuracy in long sequence modeling for Transformers. The paper provides empirical evidence to validate this hypothesis across different tasks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions of this work are:

1. The proposal of Fastformer, a new Transformer architecture based on additive attention that can process long sequences efficiently in linear time complexity. 

2. The use of element-wise products to model the interactions between global context vectors and individual token representations. This allows Fastformer to incorporate global context information efficiently.

3. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrating that Fastformer is much faster than many existing Transformer variants while achieving competitive performance on tasks like sentiment classification, news recommendation, and text summarization.

In summary, the key novelty is the design of Fastformer using techniques like additive attention and element-wise products to enable modeling long sequences with global contexts in linear complexity. The experimental results validate that this approach can speed up Transformers substantially without sacrificing much accuracy. The efficient incorporation of global context is the main technical contribution of this work.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key ways this Fastformer paper compares to related work on efficient Transformers:

- It proposes using additive attention to summarize the query and key matrices into global vectors. This allows modeling global context information efficiently in linear complexity. Other methods like sparse attention in BigBird/Longformer or low-rank approximation in Linformer do not summarize global context as explicitly.

- It models the interaction between global and local representations via element-wise product. This allows capturing both global and local context effectively. Other methods like concatenation or addition may not model the interactions as well.

- Experiments show Fastformer is much faster than Transformers, Longformers, Linformers etc on long sequences, validating its efficiency benefits. It also achieves competitive accuracy to them on various tasks.

- Compared to other linear-complexity Transformers, Fastformer has a simpler architecture without too many additional components like hashing, kernels, hierarchical pooling etc. This likely makes it faster and easier to implement. 

- Fastformer requires fewer parameters than standard Transformers due to weight sharing. This reduces memory requirements.

Overall, Fastformer proposes a lightweight yet effective way to incorporate global context modeling into Transformers in linear complexity. The global-local interaction modeling and simplicity of the additive attention design are notable differences from prior efficient Transformer techniques. The strong experimental results validate Fastformer's advantages in balancing efficiency and accuracy on long sequences.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Pre-training Fastformer-based language models to better empower NLP tasks that involve long document modeling. The efficient architecture of Fastformer makes it suitable for pre-training on large corpora.

- Applying Fastformer to other scenarios like e-commerce recommendation and ads CTR prediction to improve user modeling based on long user behavior sequences. The ability of Fastformer to efficiently process long sequences could be beneficial. 

- Exploring different interaction functions beyond element-wise product to model the relationship between global contexts and token representations. The paper shows element-wise product works well, but there may be other options to study.

- Adapting Fastformer for other modalities beyond text, such as using it for long sequence modeling in speech or image tasks. The core ideas of Fastformer are not text-specific.

- Enhancing Fastformer with different pre-training objectives, normalization methods, positional encodings, etc. There are many possible augmentations to the base Fastformer architecture.

- Evaluating Fastformer on a wider range of NLP tasks, like long document classification, QA, summarization, translation. More extensive experimentation could reveal strengths/weaknesses.

In summary, the authors point to pre-training, applying Fastformer to other use cases, and exploring architecture variants as the main future work directions based on this paper. Evaluating on more tasks and modalities could also be interesting follow-ons.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes Fastformer, an efficient Transformer model for text modeling based on additive attention. Fastformer first summarizes the input query matrix into a global query vector using additive attention. It then models the interaction between the global query vector and attention keys via element-wise product to obtain a global context-aware key matrix, which is further summarized into a global key vector.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

The paper proposes Fastformer, an efficient Transformer model for handling long text sequences. Fastformer is based on additive attention, which allows it to summarize the input representations into global context vectors in linear complexity. It first uses additive attention to condense the query matrix into a global query vector that captures contextual information. This global query vector is then combined with each key vector using element-wise multiplication to model their interactions and create a global context-aware key matrix. This key matrix is summarized into a global key vector via another round of additive attention. The global key vector interacts with each value vector using element-wise multiplication to generate a global context-aware value matrix. This value matrix is transformed and added to the original query matrix to produce the final output. Compared to standard Transformer models which have quadratic complexity, Fastformer can model long sequences much more efficiently in linear time. Extensive experiments on sentiment analysis, news topic classification, news recommendation, and summarization datasets demonstrate that Fastformer is significantly more efficient than existing Transformer variants while achieving competitive performance on modeling long text. The results highlight the advantages of using additive attention and element-wise operations to capture global contexts for efficient and effective sequence modeling.
