# [Large Language Model Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes the idea of "Large Language Model Programs" (LLM programs) as a way to enhance the capabilities of large pre-trained language models (LLMs). 

- The key limitation of standard LLMs is that they have a fixed context size, which restricts their ability to process long sequences or large amounts of information. LLM programs aim to overcome this by embedding the LLM within an external program that controls the input/output to the LLM.

- LLM programs break down complex tasks into simpler subtasks or steps. Each step uses a focused prompt and provides only the necessary context to the LLM. This allows simplifying the specifications for each subtask.

- The paper demonstrates LLM programs through an example of evidence-based question answering. The program has a filtering stage to select relevant paragraphs, followed by a tree search to iteratively expand reasoning chains.

- Without any finetuning, the LLM program achieves improved performance compared to standard prompting techniques like chain of thought reasoning.

- The paper argues LLM programs can expand capabilities, improve interpretability, incorporate algorithmic knowledge, and provide generalization guarantees compared to end-to-end training.

- Recent related work is highlighted showing the emerging use of multi-step programs and modules with LLMs.

In summary, the key hypothesis is that structured LLM programs can greatly expand the capabilities of large pre-trained language models in a more interpretable and generalizable way compared to standard finetuning approaches. The question answering example supports this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is presenting the concept of Large Language Model Programs (LLM programs). Specifically:

- It proposes embedding pre-trained large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 within classic computer programs to expand their capabilities to more complex tasks without extensive finetuning.

The paper demonstrates and advocates for this methodology through an example implementation, literature review, and discussion.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a method to enhance the capabilities of large language models by embedding them within programs, breaking complex tasks into multiple simpler steps that leverage the model's strengths while overcoming its limitations.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for improving the reasoning and question-answering capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without finetuning, by embedding the LLM within an algorithmic program. The key ideas are:

- Decomposing complex reasoning tasks into simpler subtasks that are within the capabilities of the LLM. Each subtask has its own prompt and context.

- Combining the LLM outputs through an algorithmic program implemented in Python. This allows incorporating algorithmic capabilities beyond what the LLM can do alone.

- Evaluating each component in isolation to systematically improve the overall system.

This approach contrasts with most prior work that aims to improve LLMs through continued pretraining or finetuning on task data. While scaling model size and data has shown impressive gains, it requires massive compute resources. This paper explores an orthogonal direction - keeping the base LLM fixed but wrapping it in an algorithmic program.

The modular programmatic approach relates to other recent works like Decomposed Prompting, Faithful Inference, and LAMBADA. However, this paper presents the idea in a general framework of "LLM programs" and provides both motivation and a detailed example application. The concrete gains in question answering demonstrate the potential.

Overall, this is an intriguing concept that combines neural models and classic algorithms. If productized effectively, LLM programs could expand capabilities without requiring more model training. The main limitations are the need for human insight in task decomposition, and potential brittleness. But it opens up an under-explored area complementary to scaling model size.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several potential future research directions:

- Explore different methods for paragraph ranking and selection in the evidence filtering stage, such as using semantic similarity rather than likelihood. They found likelihood ranking worked well but other methods may further improve performance.

- Develop more advanced tree search algorithms that expand and rank reasoning chains in the tree search stage. The simple beam search they used showed benefits but more sophisticated heuristic search algorithms from AI could be explored.

- Apply the LLM program approach to other complex tasks beyond question answering, such as summarization, translation, dialogue agents, etc. The modular approach could be beneficial in many settings.

- Develop general purpose LLM programs that are task-independent, rather than task-specific programs. Existing work has focused on task-specific programs but reusable programs could be more widely impactful.

- Combine LLMs with other systems like knowledge bases, search engines, calculators etc. within an LLM program. This could augment LLMs with external knowledge and computation.

- Use LLM programs as a way to induce learning algorithms, through interaction loops and memory components. This could lead to more capable and scalable learned systems.

- Formally study the benefits of LLM programs, in terms of interpretability, out-of-distribution generalization, safety, sample efficiency etc. This could provide theoretical grounding for the approach.

Overall the paper suggests LLM programs are a promising approach that warrants significant further exploration, both for developing programs for new tasks and studying the methodology itself. The modular approach may help overcome limitations of monolithic LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents the concept of Large Language Model Programs (LLM Programs), which involves embedding pre-trained language models like LLMs within classic computer programs to carry out more complex tasks. The key idea is to recursively decompose a complex task into simpler subproblems that can be solved by individual queries to the LLM. This allows combining the strengths of LLMs with algorithmic capabilities of programs. The authors argue this can expand the capabilities of LLM systems without extensive finetuning. They provide an example LLM program for evidence-based question answering which improves performance by filtering paragraphs and searching reasoning chains. The paper also highlights advantages of this approach like interpretability and systematic generalization. It discusses related recent works using similar ideas of composing LLMs as modules and concludes by arguing LLM programs can mitigate limitations of the standard blackbox finetuning paradigm.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes using large language models (LLMs) in programs to enhance their capabilities, instead of solely relying on scaling model size and finetuning. LLMs have limitations due to their training data, architecture constraints, lack of interpretability, and difficulty generalizing. The paper argues that embedding LLMs in programs mitigates these issues by decomposing complex tasks into simpler steps that leverage the LLMs' strengths. Programs allow more control, systematic testing, safety mechanisms, and algorithmic guarantees unavailable to blackbox LLMs. An example LLM program for evidence-based question answering is presented, which filters irrelevant paragraphs then performs a tree search to generate reasoning chains. Without finetuning, this program improves accuracy over baseline LLMs by 6.4%. The authors also overview related works utilizing LLM programs, such as for reasoning, summarization, and dialogue. They conclude that LLM programs offer a promising direction to expand capabilities, address limitations, and achieve more complex behaviors from fixed LLMs.

In summary, the paper proposes programming with LLMs to enhance their capabilities and mitigate their limitations. The authors present an example LLM program for question answering and review related works leveraging this approach across areas like reasoning and dialogue. They argue LLM programs allow more control, safety, and algorithmic guarantees compared to scaling up blackbox LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a method to expand the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by embedding them within algorithms or programs. The key idea is to decompose a complex task into multiple simpler steps that can be solved by individual queries to the LLM. Each LLM query is provided with a step-specific prompt and only the context necessary for that step. The results from the LLM queries are then combined by an external program, allowing more complex behavior than a single query to the LLM. This approach allows incorporating algorithmic information and expanding the capabilities of LLMs without extensive finetuning. The authors demonstrate the benefits on an evidence-supported question answering task, where they embed the LLM in a program with a filtering stage to select relevant paragraphs and a tree search to generate reasoning chains conditioned on those paragraphs. This approach improves performance without any finetuning.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper appears to be addressing the limitations of large language models (LLMs) and proposing an approach called "Large Language Model Programs" (LLM programs) to enhance their capabilities. 

Some key problems/questions it seems to be tackling:

- LLMs struggle with complex reasoning and algorithmic tasks like sorting or searching, even when finetuned on traces of such tasks. The paper argues this is due to limitations in their training methodology and architecture.

- Finetuning LLMs on expert demonstrations of complex behaviors requires large amounts of high-quality domain-specific data. The paper argues this approach may not generalize systematically.

- LLMs have a finite context size which restricts their capability to only process information within that context window. This limits their reasoning ability.

- It's difficult to give guarantees about the behavior of neural models like LLMs due to lack of interpretability and tendency to fail on out-of-distribution examples.

To address these issues, the paper proposes "programming with LLMs" - composing LLMs within broader algorithms or programs to expand their capabilities. The key idea is to break down complex tasks into a series of simpler prompt-driven steps that play to the LLMs' strengths.

The paper demonstrates this LLM program approach through an example application in evidence-based question answering. It shows improved performance without any finetuning. The paper also highlights other recent works implicitly using this methodology.
