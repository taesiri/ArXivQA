# [Large Language Model Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05364)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the key points of this paper are:- The paper proposes the idea of "Large Language Model Programs" (LLM programs) as a way to enhance the capabilities of large pre-trained language models (LLMs). - The key limitation of standard LLMs is that they have a fixed context size, which restricts their ability to process long sequences or large amounts of information. LLM programs aim to overcome this by embedding the LLM within an external program that controls the input/output to the LLM.- LLM programs break down complex tasks into simpler subtasks or steps. Each step uses a focused prompt and provides only the necessary context to the LLM. This allows simplifying the specifications for each subtask.- The paper demonstrates LLM programs through an example of evidence-based question answering. The program has a filtering stage to select relevant paragraphs, followed by a tree search to iteratively expand reasoning chains.- Without any finetuning, the LLM program achieves improved performance compared to standard prompting techniques like chain of thought reasoning.- The paper argues LLM programs can expand capabilities, improve interpretability, incorporate algorithmic knowledge, and provide generalization guarantees compared to end-to-end training.- Recent related work is highlighted showing the emerging use of multi-step programs and modules with LLMs.In summary, the key hypothesis is that structured LLM programs can greatly expand the capabilities of large pre-trained language models in a more interpretable and generalizable way compared to standard finetuning approaches. The question answering example supports this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting the concept of Large Language Model Programs (LLM programs). Specifically:- It proposes embedding pre-trained large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 within classic computer programs to expand their capabilities to more complex tasks without extensive finetuning. - It argues this can help overcome limitations of the standard approaches of simply scaling up parameters/data or finetuning LLMs, such as lack of interpretability, safety, cost of training data, lack of generalization guarantees, and architectural constraints.- It demonstrates the benefits of this approach through an example LLM program for evidence-based question answering. The program improves performance by using the LLM for paragraph filtering and tree search over reasoning chains.- It highlights and categorizes various recent works that implicitly follow this emerging methodology of composing LLMs as modules within programs.- It discusses the advantages and disadvantages of programming with LLMs versus end-to-end training, arguing it can be preferable when the desired processing is well-understood.In summary, the main contribution is proposing LLM programs as a promising approach to expand the capabilities and mitigate limitations of large pre-trained language models. The paper demonstrates and advocates for this methodology through an example implementation, literature review, and discussion.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper presents a method to enhance the capabilities of large language models by embedding them within programs, breaking complex tasks into multiple simpler steps that leverage the model's strengths while overcoming its limitations.
