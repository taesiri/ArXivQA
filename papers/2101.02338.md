# [Max-Affine Spline Insights Into Deep Network Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02338)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we leverage spline theory to gain new insights into deep network pruning techniques, such as the lottery ticket hypothesis, and develop more efficient and principled pruning strategies?Specifically, the key goals and hypotheses seem to be:- Using spline theory to interpret and visualize how pruning affects a deep network's underlying input space partitioning and decision boundaries. The hypothesis is that this will provide new theoretical understanding of pruning techniques.- Discovering that a deep network's spline mapping exhibits "early bird" behavior, converging early in training. The hypothesis is that this can be leveraged to efficiently detect when a network is ready to be pruned. - Developing a new pruning strategy focused on removing redundant nodes that don't contribute to the decision boundary, guided by the spline perspective. The hypothesis is that this will be a more efficient and principled approach compared to prior methods.Overall, the central research direction is using insights from spline theory to analyze and improve deep network pruning, with a focus on efficiency, interpretability, and principles from geometry/function approximation. The key hypothesis is that the spline viewpoint will enable progress in understanding, visualizing, and developing pruning techniques.
