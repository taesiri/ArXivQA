# [Max-Affine Spline Insights Into Deep Network Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02338)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we leverage spline theory to gain new insights into deep network pruning techniques, such as the lottery ticket hypothesis, and develop more efficient and principled pruning strategies?Specifically, the key goals and hypotheses seem to be:- Using spline theory to interpret and visualize how pruning affects a deep network's underlying input space partitioning and decision boundaries. The hypothesis is that this will provide new theoretical understanding of pruning techniques.- Discovering that a deep network's spline mapping exhibits "early bird" behavior, converging early in training. The hypothesis is that this can be leveraged to efficiently detect when a network is ready to be pruned. - Developing a new pruning strategy focused on removing redundant nodes that don't contribute to the decision boundary, guided by the spline perspective. The hypothesis is that this will be a more efficient and principled approach compared to prior methods.Overall, the central research direction is using insights from spline theory to analyze and improve deep network pruning, with a focus on efficiency, interpretability, and principles from geometry/function approximation. The key hypothesis is that the spline viewpoint will enable progress in understanding, visualizing, and developing pruning techniques.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. The paper discovers and bridges the connection between spline theory and network pruning techniques. It relates pruning of network nodes/weights to the network's underlying input space partition, per-region affine mappings, and decision boundary. This provides an interpretation of pruning strategies at different granularity levels.2. The paper proposes a pruning-invariant metric to quantify the evolution of the network's spline partition during training. This allows efficient detection of "early bird" (EB) tickets - subnetworks that can be pruned early while maintaining accuracy. The proposed metric detects EB tickets regardless of pruning technique. 3. The paper leverages the spline formulation and EB ticket findings to develop an efficient pruning strategy. It prunes nodes that have redundant contributions to the spline partition. Experiments show this method reduces training FLOPs by up to 3.5x while maintaining accuracy compared to prior art.In summary, the key contribution is using spline theory to analyze network pruning. This provides new insights into pruning techniques, allows proposing a unified EB ticket detection method, and enables developing a more principled pruning strategy. The approach is validated through extensive experiments.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:The paper proposes a novel method to interpret and improve deep network pruning techniques using spline theory, discovering an early-bird phenomenon in the evolution of deep networks' spline mappings that enables more efficient pruning.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

This paper provides novel insights into deep network pruning by connecting it with spline theory. Here are some key ways it compares to other related work:- It offers the first explicit characterization and visualization of how different pruning strategies (structured vs unstructured) affect a network's underlying spline mapping and decision boundaries. This level of understanding has been lacking in prior pruning research.- It discovers an "early bird" phenomenon in the evolution of a network's spline mapping, allowing the detection of winning tickets/subnetworks earlier in training regardless of the pruning method. In contrast, prior early bird ticket work depended on the specific pruning strategy used.- It proposes a new principled pruning method based on redundant spline boundaries that provides strong empirical performance. Most prior pruning methods are heuristic and not derived from an underlying theory.- The spline viewpoint enables analysis and comparisons of pruning techniques in a unified mathematical framework. Prior theoretical analysis has been more specialized to particular methods.Overall, this work makes significant theoretical and practical contributions by connecting two major areas - spline theory and network pruning. It provides fundamental new insights that advance the theoretical foundations of how and why pruning works. The novel perspective opens up many directions for further research in this field.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Conducting an in-depth theoretical study to understand why pruned networks are able to maintain high performance. The authors state that providing a theoretical framework to study pruning techniques would be beneficial, and their work provides insights and inspiration for such theoretical developments.- Investigating whether there are clear boundaries/conditions to determine when overparameterization versus pretraining provides the best initialization for small networks. The relative benefits of these two approaches likely depends on factors like the architecture and pruning ratio. - Studying how much overparameterization is needed to maintain good accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to other initialization techniques like layerwise pretraining. The authors propose this as an interesting question for future work.- Extending the spline-based analysis and pruning techniques to other architectures like transformers. The authors recognize adapting their methods to attention layers as an interesting challenge since they do not directly correspond to continuous piecewise affine functions.- Conducting spline pruning dynamically at runtime to further improve efficiency. The authors suggest this could build off their pruning insights to prune on the fly rather than just statically.- Providing theoretical guarantees on which dimension reduction techniques, like PCA, preserve the relevant information to assess unit redundancy for spline pruning. This could strengthen the theoretical understanding.- Continuing to build interpretability tools based on the spline perspective, such as the visualizations of the input space partitioning. This could yield additional insights into model behavior.In summary, the main suggested directions are: 1) theoretical analysis, 2) studying initialization techniques, 3) handling new architectures, 4) runtime pruning, 5) guarantees for dimensionality reduction, and 6) interpretability.
