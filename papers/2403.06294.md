# [ArgMed-Agents: Explainable Clinical Decision Reasoning with Large   Language Models via Argumentation Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06294)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex clinical reasoning and providing explainable decisions, leading to lack of trust. 
- Existing methods have limitations in formally enhancing LLMs' reasoning abilities or generating coherent explanations.

Proposed Solution:
- Present ArgMed-Agents, a multi-agent framework for explainable clinical reasoning.  
- Uses an Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (ASCD) to model the reasoning process. ASCD includes schemes for decision, side effects, better decisions.
- Has three LLM agents - Generator, Verifier, Reasoner. Generator proposes arguments, Verifier checks them, and Reasoner identifies coherent arguments.
- Agents interact via ASCD rules to iterate through critical questioning and argumentation. This builds an argumentation framework solved by the Reasoner.  

Key Contributions:
- Formalized clinicians' cognitive processes into ASCD for interactive reasoning by LLM agents.
- Design of Generator, Verifier and Reasoner agents that collaborate via ASCD rules and build an argumentation framework.
- Reasoner identifies coherent arguments using abstract argumentation semantics, enabling explainable decisions.
- Evaluations show improved accuracy over baselines and better explainability through predictability and traceability.
- Enables LLMs to generate explanations in a self-directed manner that matches clinician reasoning processes.

In summary, the paper presents a novel approach ArgMed-Agents that models clinical reasoning processes into interactive schemes for LLM agents. Through iterative critical questioning and argumentation, it builds an argumentation framework that is solved to provide explainable and accurate clinical decisions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper presents ArgMed-Agents, a multi-agent framework for explainable clinical decision reasoning that enables large language models to perform argumentative reasoning iteratively through self-prompting based on argumentation schemes, constructing an argument graph that is solved by a symbolic reasoner to identify rational decisions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents for explainable clinical decision reasoning with large language models (LLMs). Specifically:

1) The paper formalizes the cognitive process of clinical reasoning using an argumentation scheme for clinical decision (ASCD) and converts it into a step-by-step reasoning interaction protocol as a prompt strategy. 

2) The ArgMed-Agents framework includes three types of LLM agents - Generator, Verifier, and Reasoner. The Generator and Verifier agents iteratively generate arguments and counter-arguments based on the ASCD prompt strategy, constructing a directed argumentation graph. The Reasoner agent then identifies a coherent subset of arguments from this graph to support the decision.

3) Through both quantitative experiments and human evaluation, the paper demonstrates that ArgMed-Agents achieves better performance in accuracy and explainability for clinical decision reasoning compared to baseline methods. It enables LLMs to generate explanations of reasoning in a self-directed manner.

In summary, the key innovation is using ASCD-based multi-agent interaction to induce LLMs to perform explainable clinical reasoning via argumentation, without the need for explicit training. This both enhances accuracy and trust in LLM-based clinical decision support systems.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the Argumentation Scheme for Clinical Decision (ASCD) formally model the cognitive processes involved in clinical reasoning? What are the key components it aims to capture?

2. The paper proposes a multi-agent framework called ArgMed-Agents. Can you explain the roles of the different agents (Generator, Verifier, Reasoner) and how they interact through the ASCD prompt strategy? 

3. What theoretical motivation does the paper provide for the recursive, self-argumentative approach used in ArgMed-Agents? How does this aim to overcome limitations in logical reasoning abilities of large language models?

4. Explain how the argumentation framework resulting from the ArgMed-Agents interactions is mapped to an abstract argumentation framework. What considerations went into the attack relations that were set up between different types of arguments?

5. How does the Reasoner agent identify coherent, reasonable arguments from the abstract argumentation framework to support clinical decisions? What preferred semantics does it use and why?  

6. How does the paper define clinical reasoning errors in the context of ArgMed-Agents? What is the purpose of this definition and how could it contribute to more robust clinical reasoning?

7. Can you analyze the experimental setup used to evaluate accuracy of clinical reasoning by ArgMed-Agents? What datasets were used and what were the key findings?

8. Explain the two measures of explainability that were defined in the paper - predictability and proof-based traceability. How were these quantified in the human evaluation experiments?

9. How do the experimental results demonstrate that ArgMed-Agents enhances both accuracy and explainability of clinical reasoning compared to baseline methods? What explanations does the paper provide?

10. What limitations does the paper discuss with regards to the ArgMed-Agents framework? What future work directions are identified to build on this research?
