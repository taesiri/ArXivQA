# [The Ethics of Automating Legal Actors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00584)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper argues that automating the role of judges in legal systems using NLP raises difficult ethical challenges, while automating the role of lawyers poses fewer concerns. The authors note that judges in common law systems have an active role in shaping the law through precedent, requiring complex social and moral intuitions currently lacking in NLP systems. In contrast, lawyers mainly need to craft persuasive arguments rather than make final decisions on cases. The paper outlines technical limitations of current NLP in areas like assessing testimony and moral reasoning, as well as inherent risks of centralizing power and reducing accountability. It recommends focusing more on modeling lawyers rather than judges in legal NLP research. Overall, the authors believe automating judges should not be pursued with present technology, while assisting lawyers with NLP could provide benefits if ethical risks are addressed. They call for preserving diversity of decision makers and ensuring clear accountability with any NLP system deployment in law.
