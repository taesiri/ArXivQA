# [Graph-Based Retriever Captures the Long Tail of Biomedical Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12352)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) tend to highlight the most frequent information from their training set and neglect rarer, but potentially important, information. This is an issue in biomedical research where the latest discoveries are often obscured by the abundance of literature (information overload problem).

- Current retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, which combine LLMs with retrieved text, typically use semantic similarity of embeddings to select relevant context. However, this fails to capture a significant proportion of relevant information in imbalanced corpora like biomedical literature.

Solution:
- Propose a knowledge graph (KG) based retrieval method to access the "long tail" of biomedical knowledge and mitigate the information overload problem. 

- Build a biomedical KG from PubMed articles using entity recognition and relation extraction. Map sentences to KG based on the entities they contain.

- Retrieve text chunks along the shortest path between query entities in the KG. Prioritize based on recency and impact of associated documents to surface latest significant discoveries.

- Evaluate on retrieving drug targets for 8 diseases. KG retrieval significantly outperforms embedding similarity retrieval in both precision and recall.

- Visualization shows embedding similarity is limited to the neighborhood of the query, while KG retrieval better captures long tail clusters.

- A hybrid model combining both methods has the best overall performance, showing their complementarity.

Contributions:

- First to highlight information overload issue in RAG and propose KG retrieval to mitigate it

- Introduce novel KG-based retrieval approach that provides superior access to long tail biomedical knowledge

- Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance combining semantic similarity and structured KG retrieval

The key insight is that a KG can help rebalance imbalanced corpora to improve RAG retrieval, while still benefiting from embedding similarity. The proposed hybrid RAG system could enable improvements in biomedical question answering.
