# [Eliciting Kemeny Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the problem of efficiently aggregating the preferences of a group of voters over a set of alternatives to determine a consensus ranking. This is challenging when the number of alternatives is large, as eliciting complete preference orders from all voters can be very time consuming.

- The paper frames this as a dueling bandits problem, where the arms correspond to alternatives and feedback is a random voter's preference between two arms. The goal is to efficiently sample voter preferences to estimate an approximate Kemeny ranking that minimizes aggregate voter disagreement.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows how confidence bounds on estimated winning probabilities between alternatives can be used to derive bounds on the approximation error of the Kemeny score. This enables devising PAC algorithms.

- Sampling strategies are proposed for sampling voters uniformly at random (with replacement) or from a fixed population without replacement. Sample complexity bounds are derived and pruning techniques to tighten confidence bounds are presented.

Main Contributions:
- Connects preference aggregation for Kemeny rankings to the dueling bandits setting and proposes desirable properties for preference matrices

- Provides approximation bounds on Kemeny score difference based on confidence intervals of winning probabilities, enabling PAC algorithms

- Analyzes sample complexity of uniform sampling strategies, with and without replacement from a fixed voter population

- Describes pruning techniques to further tighten confidence bounds and reduce sample complexity

- Compares performance of sampling strategies experimentally on synthetic data, demonstrating advantages of pruning and sampling without replacement

In summary, the paper provides a novel dueling bandits formulation for preference aggregation and Kemeny rankings, with theoretical analysis and encouraging experimental results on the potential for efficient preference elicitation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper formulates the problem of eliciting agents' preferences to find a Kemeny ranking as a Dueling Bandits problem, analyzes approximation bounds and sample complexity for different elicitation strategies, and compares methods experimentally on synthetic data.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) Formulating the problem of eliciting voter preferences to find a Kemeny ranking as a Dueling Bandits problem, where the bandit arms correspond to alternatives to be ranked and bandit feedback corresponds to a randomly sampled voter's preference comparison.

2) Deriving approximation bounds on the Kemeny score difference between the true Kemeny ranking and an approximate Kemeny ranking based on confidence intervals around estimated winning probabilities of arms. 

3) Proposing PAC algorithms for finding approximate Kemeny rankings with guarantees on the approximation quality, for both sampling voters with and without replacement. The paper analyzes the sample complexity of these algorithms.

4) Providing methods to prune confidence intervals on winning probabilities when eliciting preferences from a known voter population, and evaluating adaptive sampling strategies that utilize these methods.

In summary, the main contribution is framing preference elicitation for Kemeny rankings in a bandit setting, developing approximation guarantees based on this, and devising and evaluating elicitation algorithms for this problem.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper formulates the problem of eliciting voter preferences as a dueling bandit problem. How does this formulation allow leveraging existing techniques for bandit problems? What are some challenges in directly applying bandit algorithms to preference elicitation?

2. The paper shows that approximating the Kendall tau distance between Kemeny rankings of similar matrices can be arbitrarily bad. Why does this occur and why is the Kemeny score a more suitable measure? How do you prove the bounds relating Kemeny score differences to differences in preference matrices?

3. Explain the technique used for deriving confidence intervals when sampling without replacement and how it leads to an improved sample complexity compared to sampling with replacement. What assumptions need to hold?

4. The paper describes various adaptive sampling strategies like optimistic, pessimistic and Bayesian sampling based on lookahead predictions. Explain these strategies and their tradeoffs. How sensitive are the experimental results to the lookahead parameter?  

5. Could you apply the methodology to elicit Borda or Copeland winners and provide approximation guarantees? What changes would be necessary compared to approximating Kemeny rankings?

6. The experimental evaluation uses synthetically generated preference profiles. How would the relative performance of methods change if applied to real-world preference data? What types of structure in preferences could be exploited?

7. Explain the pruning techniques based on symmetry and triangle inequality constraints. How much do they reduce sample complexity in practice? Could you derive further logical constraints to prune confidence intervals?  

8. The paper assumes a fixed approximation parameter ρ. How would you choose ρ based on properties of the preference profile such as number of candidates, voters etc. to ensure efficiency?

9. How do approximation guarantees degrade if voters specify partial instead of complete preference orders? Could inferred preference information be included when pruning confidence bounds?

10. The proposed methodology elicits an approximate Kemeny ranking. How would you extend it to determine a full Kemeny voting rule, i.e., return multiple optimal rankings in case of ties?
