# [Eliciting Kemeny Rankings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11663)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- The paper considers the problem of efficiently aggregating the preferences of a group of voters over a set of alternatives to determine a consensus ranking. This is challenging when the number of alternatives is large, as eliciting complete preference orders from all voters can be very time consuming.

- The paper frames this as a dueling bandits problem, where the arms correspond to alternatives and feedback is a random voter's preference between two arms. The goal is to efficiently sample voter preferences to estimate an approximate Kemeny ranking that minimizes aggregate voter disagreement.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper shows how confidence bounds on estimated winning probabilities between alternatives can be used to derive bounds on the approximation error of the Kemeny score. This enables devising PAC algorithms.

- Sampling strategies are proposed for sampling voters uniformly at random (with replacement) or from a fixed population without replacement. Sample complexity bounds are derived and pruning techniques to tighten confidence bounds are presented.

Main Contributions:
- Connects preference aggregation for Kemeny rankings to the dueling bandits setting and proposes desirable properties for preference matrices

- Provides approximation bounds on Kemeny score difference based on confidence intervals of winning probabilities, enabling PAC algorithms

- Analyzes sample complexity of uniform sampling strategies, with and without replacement from a fixed voter population

- Describes pruning techniques to further tighten confidence bounds and reduce sample complexity

- Compares performance of sampling strategies experimentally on synthetic data, demonstrating advantages of pruning and sampling without replacement

In summary, the paper provides a novel dueling bandits formulation for preference aggregation and Kemeny rankings, with theoretical analysis and encouraging experimental results on the potential for efficient preference elicitation.
