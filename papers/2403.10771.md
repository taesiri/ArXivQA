# [A Probabilistic Approach for Alignment with Human Comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10771)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Machine learning models trained on noisy data can perform poorly when deployed. Overly complex models with many parameters can also overfit. 
- Humans possess expertise and contextual knowledge that could help refine models, but theoretically quantifying when human feedback improves performance over standard supervised learning has not been studied.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a two-stage "Supervised Fine Tuning + Human Comparison" (SFT+HC) framework.  
- Stage 1: Use noisy labeled data to train a model and learn low-dimensional representations robust to noise.
- Stage 2: Actively query human comparisons between model predictions to refine the model. A "probabilistic bisection" approach efficiently homes in on the optimal model.

Main Contributions:
- Introduce a concept called "label noise-to-comparison accuracy" (LNCA) ratio to characterize when SFT+HC outperforms pure SFT. Derive theoretical conditions on this ratio for superior performance.
- Propose a probabilistic bisection algorithm for optimal sample complexity of human comparisons in Stage 2. Derive sample complexity bounds.  
- Empirically validate the LNCA ratio conditions in an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment. Compare performance between SFT+HC and SFT.
- Provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for when and how human comparisons through the SFT+HC approach can enhance standard supervised learning. Characterize the tradeoffs involved.

In summary, the paper proposes a principled two-stage approach integrating human knowledge that outperforms pure supervised learning under certain quantified conditions relating to label noise and human accuracy. Both theoretical analysis and experiments support the superiority of this SFT+HC framework.
