# [A Three-Phases SFT Hybrid Model Integrated Strong Prior Module and Data   Overlap Estimation in the Eduation Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15426)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) lack domain expertise when applied to specialized vertical domains like education.  
- LLMs also lack the ability to act as a tutor - breaking down knowledge and providing step-by-step guided assistance to users.

Proposed Solution:  
- Preprocess data using an overlap estimation network to ensure high quality datasets for fine-tuning.
- Conduct 3-phase LORA fine-tuning on the LLAMA2-34B model - first on general knowledge, then on education data, and finally on multi-turn dialogs to learn a tutoring style.   
- Introduce a strong prior module combining a vector database, abstract syntax trees (AST), and system prompts to inject constraints. 
- Apply regularization and pruning to focus the model on teaching abilities.
- Add an output filter to remove detrimental noises.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrate superiority of the 3-phase fine-tuning approach over traditional fine-tuning.  
- Design an effective prior module to equip the model with tutoring capabilities.
- Optimization via regularization and pruning allows high performance from a medium-sized model.
- Achieve state-of-the-art coding ability while maintaining strong conversational skills.
- Genuinely achieve the ability to act as a tutor - providing guided assistance without revealing answers.

The method exhibits excellent accuracy and robustness. The overall system design focuses on transforming a general large language model into a reliable AI tutor.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an end-to-end prior-based three-phases supervised fine-tuned model to enable language models to act as tutors by providing step-by-step incremental guided outputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces a neural network structure for LLM-dataset preprocessing, which achieves high-quality datasets via random sampling and overlap estimation network. 

2. It demonstrates the superiority of the three-phases LORA fine-tuning method. Compared to traditional SFT, stepwise dataset injections for fine-tuning can significantly improve the model's performance in specific domains.

3. It designs a composite prior module, integrating vector databases, abstract syntax trees (ASTs), and efficient system prompts to implement strong correlation constraints associated with the tutor role.

4. It optimizes the educational model through regularization constraints, model compression and pruning, and text filtering, proving the feasibility of solutions in the education context.  

5. It truly embodies the essence of a tutor, and firmly achieves state-of-the-art in coding capabilities among all open-source LLMs. It also demonstrates extraordinary accuracy and robustness in multiple comparative experiments.

In summary, the key innovation is using a step-wise fine-tuning approach with strong priors to transform a general purpose LLM into a robust tutor model with excellent code generation and dialogue abilities.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper mentions using an overlap estimation network for data preprocessing. Can you explain in more detail how this network quantifies the robustness and reliability of the preprocessed data? What metrics are used?

2. The three-phases LORA fine-tuning method is a key contribution. Can you delve deeper into the mechanisms of low-rank adaptation? How does constraining the update to a low-rank decomposition improve domain-specific performance? 

3. The paper states that structured pruning focuses mainly on batch normalization layers. What is the intuition behind pruning based on the scaling factors in BN? Does this lead to a more sparse network?

4. The prior module incorporates several components like the vector database and AST. How does the vector database realize lightweight storage and efficient similarity search? 

5. When discussing the inference procedure, the paper mentions using Markov chain principles and reverting to previous derivations to suppress full-throughput outputs. Can you expand on this?

6. For the human evaluation results on coding tasks, what modifications were made to fit the vertical nature of software tasks? How were software engineering metrics like modularity captured?

7. The tutoring ability evaluation is very application-focused. What metrics were used to quantify qualities like teacher tone, guided output, and avoidance of answers? 

8. The three-phase fine-tuning approach leads to surjective mappings between raw datasets and each phase. What techniques ensured that the data at each phase sufficiently covers the desired distribution?

9. For the results in Table 3, what correlation exists between number of parameters, context length, and divergence from the tutor role? How was the threshold length quantified?

10. The method claims notable transferability to other vertical domains. What adaptations would be required to apply the pipeline more broadly while preserving a strong prior?
