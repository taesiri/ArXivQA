# [Generalized Category Discovery with Large Language Models in the Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generalized Category Discovery with Large Language Models in the Loop":

Problem:
- Generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to recognize both known and novel categories from unlabeled data based on some labeled data containing only known categories. 
- Existing methods perform poorly on novel categories due to lack of supervision. They also cannot reveal semantic meanings (e.g. category names) of discovered clusters.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Loop, an end-to-end active learning framework that introduces large language models (LLMs) into the training loop. 
- Select informative samples via local inconsistent sampling based on neighborhood prediction consistency and entropy.
- Query LLMs to choose true neighbors of selected samples from candidates.
- Perform refined neighborhood contrastive learning to pull samples closer to refined neighbors.
- Decouple clusters corresponding to novel categories and select samples to ask LLMs to generate category names.

Main Contributions:
- Novel perspective to utilize LLMs to guide training of base model for GCD.
- End-to-end framework for informative sample selection, neighborhood relationship correction with LLMs and clustering-friendly representation learning.  
- Ability to reveal semantic meanings of discovered clusters by generating accurate category names.
- Experiments show Loop outperforms state-of-the-art by 7.67% average improvement and generates valid category names with little query cost.
