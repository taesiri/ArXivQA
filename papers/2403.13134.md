# [Robust NAS under adversarial training: benchmark, theory, and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13134)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Neural architecture search (NAS) aims to automate the design of neural network architectures. Most prior NAS research focuses on maximizing standard accuracy, but architectures should also be robust to adversarial attacks.  
- There is a lack of benchmark evaluations and theoretical guarantees for searching robust architectures under adversarial training.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. The paper releases the first adversarially trained NAS benchmark called NAS-RobBench-201:
- Evaluates robust performance of 6,466 architectures from NAS-Bench-201 space under adversarial training on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.
- Provides a comprehensive assessment, including performance of NAS algorithms, node analysis of top architectures, and correlation between accuracies.

2. The paper establishes a generalization theory for multi-objective NAS (standard + adversarial training) using neural tangent kernel (NTK) tools:  
- Considers residual fully-connected and convolutional networks with activation function search, skip connections, and filter size search.
- Shows clean accuracy is determined by a joint NTK with partly clean and robust NTKs, while robust accuracy always depends on joint NTK with robust NTK and its "twice" perturbed version.
- Estimates lower bound of minimum eigenvalue of joint NTK which impacts generalization.

3. The benchmark reliably reproduces and efficiently assesses NAS algorithms for robust architectures. The theory provides a foundation for designing robust NAS approaches.

In summary, the paper makes both empirical and theoretical contributions to robust neural architecture search using adversarial training, through the release of a comprehensive benchmark and establishment of a generalization theory leveraging NTK tools. The solutions presented facilitate and guide the development of reliable and effective NAS techniques for robust architecture design.
