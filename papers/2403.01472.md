# [WARDEN: Multi-Directional Backdoor Watermarks for Embedding-as-a-Service   Copyright Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01472)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Embedding as a Service (EaaS) models are vulnerable to model extraction attacks where attackers can steal the capabilities of the models. Backdoor watermarking has been proposed as a defense to detect copied models.
- The paper analyzes a recent watermarking technique, EmbMarker, and shows that it can be compromised by a new attack called CSE (Clustering, Selection, Elimination) which removes the watermarks while maintaining embedding utility. 

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a new multi-directional watermarking technique called WARDEN (Watermark Augmentation for Robust DEfeNse) to make watermark removal more challenging. 
- WARDEN uses multiple possible watermark directions instead of one. It splits the trigger words into subsets, each associated with a different watermark embedding vector. During embedding, the watermark vectors are added to the original embeddings based on trigged word counts.
- A multi-watermark verification method checks if query embeddings are closer to any of the secretly held watermark vectors using cosine similarity and L2 distance.

Main Contributions:
- A CSE attack framework that comprises clustering, selection and elimination modules to remove existing watermarks from embeddings.
- A WARDEN defense technique to make watermark removal harder by using multiple watermark directions and vectors.
- Extensive experiments showing that WARDEN effectively counters the proposed CSE attack and is more robust and stealthier compared to prior single watermark method.

In summary, the paper exposes a vulnerability in existing EaaS watermark defenses, and proposes a new multi-directional watermarking approach to enhance robustness against watermark removal attacks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new attack called CSE that compromises existing watermarking defenses for embedding services by removing watermarks while maintaining utility, and introduces a more robust multi-directional watermarking defense called WARDEN that is resilient to the CSE attack.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper makes two main contributions:

1. It proposes a new attack called CSE (Clustering, Selection, Elimination) that can effectively remove backdoor watermarks from text embeddings while maintaining high utility. This attacks the previous state-of-the-art watermarking technique EmbMarker.

2. It introduces a new defense method called WARDEN (Watermark Augmentation for Robust DEfeNse) that makes watermark removal more challenging by using multiple possible watermark directions instead of just one. Experiments show WARDEN is robust against the CSE attack and more stealthy than the previous watermarking approach.

In summary, the main contributions are: (1) a new attack that breaches existing watermarking defenses, and (2) a new defense that is more robust against this type of attack by using multiple watermark directions.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Embedding as a Service (EaaS)
- Model extraction attack
- Backdoor watermarks
- Copyright protection
- \ourattack attack (Clustering, Selection, Elimination)
- Breaching watermarks while maintaining utility
- \ourdefence defense 
- Multi-directional watermarks
- Watermark augmentation 
- Robust copyright verification
- Stealthier watermarks

The paper proposes an attack called \ourattack that can remove backdoor watermarks from embeddings while maintaining utility, breaking a previous defense. It then contributes a more robust defense called \ourdefence that uses multiple possible watermark directions to make removing all watermarks more difficult.

Key concepts include EaaS, model extraction attacks, backdoor watermarks for copyright protection, the \ourattack and \ourdefence methods, using multiple watermark directions, and evaluating both attack and defense techniques.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the methods proposed in this paper:

1) The CSE attack involves clustering, selection, and elimination steps. What is the intuition behind using clustering as the first step? How does clustering help in the subsequent selection process?

2) The selection step in CSE attack identifies suspicious embeddings by comparing distance metrics between victim and standard models. Why is the relative ranking of distances used rather than absolute distances? What are the benefits of this approach?

3) The elimination step in CSE attack projects out top principal components from suspicious embeddings. Why are top principal components likely to represent the watermark signal? What would happen if non-top components were eliminated instead? 

4) The Warden defense uses multiple possible watermark directions to make removal more difficult. How does using more watermarks impact the difficulty of recovering all of them? What are the tradeoffs?

5) Warden's verification uses a conservative "any watermark" approach. Why is this more robust than requiring all watermarks to detect infringement? What are limitations of this approach?

6) How does making the multiple watermark directions orthogonal using Gram-Schmidt process enhance Warden defense? Why does orthogonality specifically help improve robustness?

7) If attackers had access to the secret watermark directions, could they bypass Warden defense? How easily? What precautions need to be taken by providers?

8) How does the number of eliminated principal components impact attack success on Warden defense? Why does eliminating too many components undermine attacker objectives?

9) For non-watermarked models, why does Warden sometimes show false positive detection? When do the non-p-value metrics become important?

10) How might the CSE attack and Warden defense transfer to other domains like computer vision? What challenges need to be addressed?
