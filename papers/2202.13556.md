# [Filter-enhanced MLP is All You Need for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13556)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

This paper proposes and evaluates an "all-MLP" neural network architecture enhanced with learnable filters for sequential recommendation. The main research questions/hypotheses appear to be:1) Can simple filtering algorithms like those used in signal processing help improve the performance of deep sequential recommendation models like RNNs and Transformers? 2) Can an all-MLP model with learnable filters match or exceed the performance of more complex models like RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers on sequential recommendation tasks?3) Can learnable filters help make an all-MLP model more robust to noise in the input data compared to other architectures?The key ideas explored are:- Using classical filtering algorithms like low-pass filters on the input embeddings as a simple way to reduce noise.- Proposing an all-MLP model called FMLP-Rec that incorporates learnable filters to adaptively attenuate noise.- Showing the learnable filters are theoretically equivalent to circular convolutions, giving them greater representational capacity.- Demonstrating superior performance of FMLP-Rec over competitive baselines on several real-world datasets.In summary, the main hypotheses are around using learnable filters to create a simple yet effective all-MLP model for sequential recommendation that is robust to noise. The experiments aim to validate these hypotheses.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:1. The paper proposes FMLP-Rec, a new model for sequential recommendation that uses an all-MLP architecture with learnable filters. This is the first model that combines an MLP-only structure with learnable filters for sequential recommendation.2. The learnable filters help attenuate noise in the input sequence and extract useful sequential features. Theoretically, the learnable filters are equivalent to circular convolutions, giving them a large receptive field to capture periodic patterns.3. The all-MLP structure makes the model simpler and more efficient than recurrent, CNN, or Transformer models typically used for sequential recommendation.4. Empirical experiments on 8 real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of FMLP-Rec compared to strong baselines including RNN, CNN, GNN, and Transformer-based models.In summary, the main contribution is proposing and empirically validating a new MLP-based sequential recommendation model enhanced with learnable filters that is simple, effective, and efficient compared to existing models. The combination of the all-MLP architecture and learnable filters is novel for this problem.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of sequential recommendation:- This paper focuses on using deep learning techniques like RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers for sequential recommendation. This is a very active research area with many recent papers proposing different neural network architectures. This paper is following that general research direction.- The key contribution of this paper is proposing a new model called FMLP-Rec, which is an all-MLP model with learnable filters. This is a novel architecture compared to prior works. Most other papers use RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. Using an all-MLP model is a relatively new idea.- The idea of using learnable filters to reduce noise in the input data is also novel. Other recent papers like CLEA have looked at denoising item sequences, but this paper takes a different approach through frequency domain filtering.- The empirical analysis showing that simple filters can improve performance of RNN and Transformer models is an interesting finding. This motivates the overall FMLP-Rec model.- The comparison experiments are quite comprehensive, testing FMLP-Rec against state-of-the-art RNN, CNN, and Transformer baselines over multiple real-world datasets. This benchmarks the performance rigorously.- The efficiency and lower complexity of the all-MLP model compared to Transformers is a useful advantage highlighted in the paper. This makes the model more practical.Overall, I would say this paper advances the state-of-the-art in sequential recommendation through an innovative all-MLP architecture and learnable filtering approach. The thorough experiments demonstrate solid improvements over existing methods. It offers a new research direction in this field.

The authors show their learnable filters can improve other models like RNNs and CNNs when added. They suggest exploring how to best integrate their ideas into other sequential models.4. Evaluating the approach on more complex real-world scenarios. The experiments are on some e-commerce and session-based datasets. Testing on more complex datasets from different domains could better validate the effectiveness.5. Investigating pre-training techniques to improve the model. The authors mention recent works have shown benefits of pre-training for sequential recommenders. Exploring pre-training schemes could further improve the performance.In summary, the main future directions are around developing more advanced All-MLP architectures, designing better filters, applying the ideas to other models, testing on more complex datasets, and leveraging pre-training. Advancing these aspects could help realize the full potential of the proposed concepts.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes FMLP-Rec, a new neural network architecture for sequential recommendation. The key idea is to use an all-MLP (multi-layer perceptron) architecture with learnable filters to capture useful signals and reduce noise in the input sequence data. The learnable filters operate in the frequency domain, leveraging Fourier transforms to attenuate noisy high-frequency signals. This is motivated by an empirical analysis showing that techniques like low-pass filtering can improve existing RNN and Transformer models for recommendation. Compared to Attention-based methods, the all-MLP structure requires less computation and parameters. Experiments on 8 real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance over existing RNN, CNN, and Transformer baselines for sequential recommendation. Overall, the work presents a simple yet effective approach using learnable frequency filters within an MLP network to achieve strong results for sequential recommendation.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:This paper proposes FMLP-Rec, an all-MLP model with learnable filters for sequential recommendation. The key motivation is that user behavior data often contains noise, which can cause overfitting in complex deep learning models like RNNs and Transformers. To tackle this issue, the authors borrow the idea of using filtering algorithms from signal processing to reduce noise. Empirical experiments confirm that simple filters like band-stop filters can substantially improve the performance of models like SASRec. Based on these findings, the authors develop FMLP-Rec, which uses MLP blocks with learnable filters. The learnable filters attenuate noise in the frequency domain via FFT. This is equivalent to circular convolution, allowing it to capture periodic patterns in user behavior. Without complex self-attention, FMLP-Rec has lower complexity than Transformers. Experiments on 8 real-world datasets show FMLP-Rec outperforms state-of-the-art RNN, CNN, GNN and Transformer baselines. The simple yet effective use of learnable filters makes FMLP-Rec accurate, robust, and efficient for sequential recommendation.
