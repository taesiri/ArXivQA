# [Accountable Textual-Visual Chat Learns to Reject Human Instructions in   Image Re-creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05983)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we develop accountable multimodal generative models that can perform visual reasoning and reject inappropriate human instructions during textual-visual chat?

Specifically, the authors aim to address the issue of accountability in multimodal dialogue systems by:

1) Constructing two new multimodal datasets (CLEVR-ATVC and Fruit-ATVC) that contain both visual and textual inputs/outputs to enable training and evaluation of accountable textual-visual chat models.

2) Incorporating rules into the datasets that allow models to learn to reject certain prohibited instructions or commands that cannot be executed due to mismatches with the visual input. 

3) Training autoencoder and transformer models on these datasets end-to-end to generate both recreated images and textual explanations when rejecting instructions.

4) Evaluating the model's ability to recreate images, provide accurate textual feedback, handle uncertainty, and reject instructions on the two datasets.

The key hypothesis seems to be that by incorporating rules and textual-visual input/output into the training data, they can develop multimodal models that demonstrate improved accountability via visual reasoning abilities and the capacity to reject inappropriate instructions. The experiments and results aim to validate whether their approach leads to more accountable text-image chat models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. The paper constructs two new multimodal datasets - CLEVR-ATVC (620K pairs) and Fruit-ATVC (50K pairs) - that contain both visual and textual inputs and outputs. These datasets can help develop and evaluate multimodal generative models.

2. The paper introduces the concept of "accountability" to multimodal dialogue models by incorporating rules into the datasets that require the model to learn to reject certain prohibited or infeasible human instructions. This allows testing the model's ability to provide explanatory feedback.

3. A two-stage training procedure is proposed to train the image autoencoder and transformer model from scratch. This includes using a discrete VAE (VQVAE or VQGAN) to encode the images followed by an autoregressive transformer that takes both text and image tokens as input.

4. Extensive experiments are conducted analyzing the image quality, answer accuracy, and model behavior on uncertainty and imperfect queries. The results demonstrate promising performance on the accountable text-based visual re-creation task.

5. The paper provides a valuable exploration into accountability for multimodal generative models, proposing new datasets, models, and evaluation protocols. The datasets and code are made publicly available.

In summary, the core novelty is in constructing multimodal datasets that require accountability via rejecting certain instructions, and developing models capable of textual-visual reasoning to succeed on this task. The paper makes both conceptual and practical contributions towards accountable AI systems.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

The paper introduces two new multimodal datasets for training and evaluating visual language models on accountable text-based visual re-creation tasks, requiring the models to generate both high-quality images and textual explanations for their decisions.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the same field:

- The paper proposes a new dataset and task called "accountable text-based visual re-creation" which aims to teach visual language models to reject inappropriate human instructions. This is a novel contribution as most prior work has focused on improving the quality and controllability of text-to-image generation rather than teaching models to be accountable.

- The authors construct two new multimodal datasets with image and text inputs/outputs to support this task, including preset rules to provide supervision for rejecting certain instructions. Other datasets in this field have not explicitly incorporated rules and accountability.

- The proposed model incorporates both an image autoencoder to compress the visual input and an autoregressive transformer that takes both text and image tokens as input to generate the recreated image and textual explanation. This end-to-end trainable approach differs from prior efforts that combine separately trained vision and language models.

- The authors provide comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results analyzing not just image quality and text accuracy but also model behavior when faced with uncertainty or imperfect instructions. This level of analysis is rare - most papers focus only on metrics for the end results.

- Overall, the explicit focus on model accountability, new datasets incorporating rules, end-to-end training procedure, and detailed behavioral analyses make this a novel and important contribution compared to related work on controllable text-to-image generation. The goals and approach are unique in aiming to teach models responsibility.

In summary, this paper pushes the field forward in considering model accountability and provides useful datasets and analysis to support further research in this direction. The approach stands out from prior work that focused narrowly on technical advances without similar considerations.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Developing larger multimodal datasets with image-text inputs and outputs to further validate and advance multimodal generative models. The authors mention their datasets could potentially be expanded and used for other similar tasks.

- Exploring different model architectures and training techniques for the image autoencoder and text decoder components. The authors compared VQVAE and VQGAN but other variants could be tested. Jointly training the full model end-to-end rather than a two-stage approach is another possibility. 

- Incorporating additional modalities beyond text and images, such as audio or video, into the multimodal dialogue setting. The authors focus on textual and visual inputs/outputs but note expanding to other modalities is an interesting direction.

- Enhancing the accountability mechanisms and ability to provide explanations when rejecting instructions. The authors propose basic rules and signals for accountability but more advanced reasoning could be incorporated.

- Evaluating the robustness and fairness of multimodal dialogue systems, to ensure they behave responsibly. The authors raise accountability as an important issue but further research is needed.

- Developing Reinforcement Learning and interactive learning methods to train the model through natural dialogue over time rather than static datasets. Having humans interactively teach the model could improve its capabilities.

- Deploying and testing these types of multimodal dialogue systems in real-world applications to analyze their performance and utility. The authors present promising results on datasets but real-world usage would provide additional insights.

In summary, the core directions are around expanding the datasets, exploring new model architectures, adding modalities, improving explanation abilities, and evaluating real-world performance for accountable and capable multimodal dialogue agents. The authors lay a solid foundation and provide many opportunities for future work in this emerging field.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents two new multimodal datasets for the task of accountable textual-visual chat, which requires models to generate both visual re-creations and textual feedback when given image and text inputs. The first dataset, CLEVR-ATVC, is a synthetic dataset with 620K pairs. The second, Fruit-ATVC, is a real-world dataset with 50K manually pictured and annotated pairs. Both datasets have embedded rules to teach models when to reject human instructions, enabling them to say "no" and explain why certain actions are prohibited or cannot be executed. The authors propose a two-stage training method using a discrete variational autoencoder and an auto-regressive transformer. They provide comprehensive analysis of the results on image quality, answer accuracy, and model behavior when faced with uncertainty or incomplete queries. The overall goal is to explore accountability in textual-visual dialogue models through the ability to reject instructions. The datasets and challenges presented aim to inspire further research into responsible multimodal generative models.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 The paper presents a multimodal dataset and method focused on improving the accountability of textual-visual chat systems. Here is a two paragraph summary:

The paper introduces two new multimodal datasets - CLEVR-ATVC and Fruit-ATVC - that contain paired visual and textual inputs and outputs. These datasets are designed to allow evaluation of visual language models on their ability to complete visual re-creation tasks and provide textual justifications, while adhering to pre-defined rules that enable rejecting certain instructions. The datasets contain around 600K and 50K examples, respectively. 

To model the task, the authors propose a two-stage training process. First, an image autoencoder compresses the visual input into discrete tokens. Then, an autoregressive transformer is trained to generate the visual re-creation and textual feedback by conditioning on the concatenated input tokens from the image and text. During training, loss is not backpropagated for instructions that are invalid or prohibited. The resulting model is able to provide textual justifications on whether it can satisfy the requested instruction based on the visual input, enhancing accountability. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on following allowed instructions and rejecting prohibited ones.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel task called accountable text-based visual re-creation (ATVC) to teach visual language models to reject certain human instructions and provide explanations. The authors construct two new multimodal datasets with image and text inputs/outputs - CLEVR-ATVC with 620K synthetic scenes and Fruit-ATVC with 50K real images. The datasets include supervision rules to indicate which instructions should be rejected. The method uses a two-stage training process. First, a discrete variational autoencoder compresses each image into short discrete codes. Then these codes are concatenated with text tokens and fed into a transformer decoder to generate the re-created image and textual explanation. The transformer is trained on sequences containing the text query, original image codes, re-created image codes, and answer text. It optimizes the log-likelihood of predicting the next token. For invalid instructions, the re-creation and answer losses are ignored. This allows the model to learn which instructions can or cannot be executed based on the image content and preset rules.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper proposes a new multimodal task called "accountable text-based visual re-creation" (ATVC) to explore whether textual-visual chat models can learn to reject problematic human instructions. 

- Two new multimodal datasets are constructed - CLEVR-ATVC (synthetic, 620K pairs) and Fruit-ATVC (real, 50K pairs). Both have image-text inputs and outputs to validate multimodal generative models.

- The datasets include preset rules and supervision signals so models can learn to give yes/no answers to instructions, along with textual explanations when rejecting them. This enables models to demonstrate "accountability".

- A two-stage training procedure is proposed with an image autoencoder (VQVAE or VQGAN) and an auto-regressive transformer. The image encoder compresses the image into discrete tokens, which are fed along with text tokens to the transformer decoder to generate the visual re-creation and textual feedback.

- Comprehensive experiments and analyses are provided on image quality, answer accuracy, and model behavior when facing uncertainty or incomplete queries. The goal is to contribute insights on building accountable multimodal generative models.

In summary, the key contribution is constructing multimodal datasets with accountability supervision and proposing models that can follow instructions, reject problematic ones, and explain decisions. This explores an important but under-studied issue of responsibility in textual-visual dialogue systems.
