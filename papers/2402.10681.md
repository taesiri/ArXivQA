# [Physics-informed MeshGraphNets (PI-MGNs): Neural finite element solvers   for non-stationary and nonlinear simulations on arbitrary meshes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10681)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Engineering components must meet increasing demands in ever shorter cycles, requiring concurrent development of part design, materials, and manufacturing process. 
- Numerical simulations are indispensable but quickly become computationally expensive, especially for iterative optimization.
- Existing learned surrogate models either cannot handle new arbitrary geometries or require vast training data.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces Physics-Informed MeshGraphNets (PI-MGNs), which combine physics-informed neural networks and graph neural networks.
- PI-MGNs are trained directly on finite element method (FEM) partial differential equations, avoiding expensive data generation.
- The FEM equations are discretized and evaluated per element to compute a physics-informed loss for multiple time steps and nonlinear problems.
- MGNs are enhanced with time bundling, noise injection, and global features to improve accuracy and generalization.

Main Contributions:
- PI-MGNs can accurately and reliably simulate non-stationary physics on unseen, arbitrary meshes with nonlinear materials under changing process conditions.
- Compared to data-driven MGNs, PI-MGNs achieve equal or better accuracy without needing simulation data, and generalize much better to large unseen meshes.
- PI-MGNs outperform existing physics-informed graph neural networks by an order of magnitude on 2D problems, and match performance on a 3D problem.
- Optimized PI-MGN implementations demonstrate speedups of several orders of magnitude over FEM while remaining fully differentiable.
- An ablation study analyzes the contribution of individual MGN components to performance and generalization capability.

In summary, the introduced PI-MGNs alleviate expensive data requirements while improving accuracy and generalization compared to existing approaches for fast, reliable finite element simulations on arbitrary geometries.
