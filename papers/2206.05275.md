# [Spatial-temporal Concept based Explanation of 3D ConvNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05275)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to interpret and explain the decision procedure of 3D video recognition convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) using spatial-temporal concepts?The key points are:- The paper proposes a 3D Automatic Concept-based Explanation (3D ACE) framework to interpret 3D ConvNets for video recognition. - The goal is to identify the most important spatial-temporal volumes (concepts) that influence the 3D ConvNet's predictions.- This allows exploring which concepts the 3D ConvNets focus on and how much role they play during prediction. - The paper validates the proposed method on video action classification using the Kinetics dataset and shows it can extract concepts consistent with human intuition.So in summary, the central research contribution is developing an interpretability method to explain 3D ConvNets for video analysis using spatial-temporal concepts, which provides human-understandable explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a spatial-temporal concept-based explanation framework (3D ACE) for interpreting 3D video recognition ConvNets. Specifically:- It represents videos using high-level supervoxels, which is easy for humans to understand. - It estimates an importance score for each voxel to reflect its importance in the decision procedure of the ConvNet for a classification task.- It discovers spatial-temporal concepts at different importance levels to explore how these concepts influence action classification predictions.In summary, the key contribution is using spatial-temporal concepts to provide explanations for 3D ConvNets in a human-interpretable way, as opposed to prior work that relied on pixel-level attention or handled spatial and temporal dimensions separately. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D ACE approach can effectively interpret 3D ConvNets consistent with human cognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a 3D Automatic Concept-based Explanation (ACE) framework to interpret 3D convolutional neural networks for video action classification by representing videos with supervoxels, clustering them into spatial-temporal concepts, and evaluating the importance of each concept for a target task like classification.
