# [Spatial-temporal Concept based Explanation of 3D ConvNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05275)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How to interpret and explain the decision procedure of 3D video recognition convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) using spatial-temporal concepts?The key points are:- The paper proposes a 3D Automatic Concept-based Explanation (3D ACE) framework to interpret 3D ConvNets for video recognition. - The goal is to identify the most important spatial-temporal volumes (concepts) that influence the 3D ConvNet's predictions.- This allows exploring which concepts the 3D ConvNets focus on and how much role they play during prediction. - The paper validates the proposed method on video action classification using the Kinetics dataset and shows it can extract concepts consistent with human intuition.So in summary, the central research contribution is developing an interpretability method to explain 3D ConvNets for video analysis using spatial-temporal concepts, which provides human-understandable explanations.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a spatial-temporal concept-based explanation framework (3D ACE) for interpreting 3D video recognition ConvNets. Specifically:- It represents videos using high-level supervoxels, which is easy for humans to understand. - It estimates an importance score for each voxel to reflect its importance in the decision procedure of the ConvNet for a classification task.- It discovers spatial-temporal concepts at different importance levels to explore how these concepts influence action classification predictions.In summary, the key contribution is using spatial-temporal concepts to provide explanations for 3D ConvNets in a human-interpretable way, as opposed to prior work that relied on pixel-level attention or handled spatial and temporal dimensions separately. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed 3D ACE approach can effectively interpret 3D ConvNets consistent with human cognition.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:The paper proposes a 3D Automatic Concept-based Explanation (ACE) framework to interpret 3D convolutional neural networks for video action classification by representing videos with supervoxels, clustering them into spatial-temporal concepts, and evaluating the importance of each concept for a target task like classification.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few thoughts on how this CVPR 2022 paper template compares to other research in computer vision:- This appears to be a standard CVPR conference paper format, not an actual research paper. The template provides guidelines and styling for submitting papers to the CVPR conference, but does not present novel research.- The template covers important formatting aspects like page layout, sections, figures, tables, equations, citations, etc. This allows authors to focus on their research content rather than formatting details. The formatting follows common practices in academic publications.- References are provided to standard LaTeX packages for formatting, as well as tips on using hyperref for cross-referencing. This promotes consistency and quality across all CVPR submissions.- Overall, this conference paper template offers a solid starting point for preparing CVPR submissions. It encapsulates best practices without being too prescriptive. The intent is to standardize style while letting authors concentrate on their innovations in computer vision research.- Compared to a computer vision research paper, this template lacks actual methodologies, experiments, results, and discussions. The content placeholders are meant to demonstrate sections and length, but do not constitute substantive research contributions.- In summary, the template provides authors with clear CVPR formatting guidelines to produce professional conference submissions. It does not itself present novel ideas for advancing computer vision, as a research paper would. The value is in facilitating quality writing and presentation of ideas.
