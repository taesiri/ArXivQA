# [LLMArena: Assessing Capabilities of Large Language Models in Dynamic   Multi-Agent Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16499)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Existing benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) have limitations, such as using static datasets that can lead to data leakage or only focusing on single-agent scenarios that overlook complexities of multi-agent interactions.  
- There is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate diverse capabilities of LLMs in dynamic, multi-agent environments.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper introduces LLMArena, a novel framework with 7 distinct gaming environments to evaluate LLMs' capabilities including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration.

- The environments are dynamic and involve interactions between multiple LLM agents, addressing limitations of previous single-agent benchmarks. 

- The benchmark adopts the TrueSkill scoring system to evaluate metrics beyond just win rate, like relative skill levels between agents.

Main Contributions:
- Comprehensive benchmark suite that evaluates diverse capabilities of LLMs in dynamic, multi-agent settings.

- Adoption of TrueSkill system and reward metrics for more nuanced assessment compared to simplistic win rate.

- Extensive experiments among 14 LLMs of varying sizes and analysis along 7 key perspectives.

- Demonstration that significant gaps exist in LLMs' performance compared to humans in spatial reasoning, opponent modeling and team collaboration.

- Benchmark can guide future research to enhance LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent environments and practical applications.
