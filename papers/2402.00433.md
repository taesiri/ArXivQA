# [Merging Multi-Task Models via Weight-Ensembling Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00433)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Merging multiple task-specific vision models into a single unified model is an effective approach for multi-task learning. However, existing methods mainly seek a static optimal solution within the original model parameter space. This limits their adaptability to the unique requirements of each instance. Another key challenge is mitigating the interference between parameters of different models, which can substantially deteriorate performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- Propose a novel method to merge Transformer-based vision models. The method merges most model parameters while upscaling the MLPs of Transformer layers into a Weight-Ensembling Mixture of Experts (WEMoE) module.

- The WEMoE module can dynamically integrate shared knowledge (from pre-trained model) and task-specific knowledge (from fine-tuned models) based on the input sample. This provides a flexible solution adapted to each instance.

- The key idea is to identify and separate shared and task-specific knowledge, then dynamically integrate them based on the input. This helps mitigate parameter interference.

Main Contributions:
- Effective method to transfer knowledge from multiple fine-tuned vision models into a unified multi-task model.

- Novel WEMoE module that dynamically combines shared and task-specific knowledge based on input, enabling flexibility.

- Extensive experiments demonstrating effectiveness of proposed method in multi-task model merging, generalization ability, and robustness to corrupted test data.

In summary, the paper proposes a flexible approach to merge vision Transformers by introducing a novel module, WEMoE, that can dynamically integrate knowledge. Experiments validate the effectiveness and robustness of this method for constructing unified multi-task models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method to merge Transformer-based vision models by merging most parameters while using a weight-ensembling Mixture-of-Experts module in the MLPs to dynamically integrate shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input sample.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It proposes a novel method to merge Transformer-based vision models that have been pre-trained and fine-tuned on different downstream tasks into a single unified multi-task model. 

2. It designs a new Weight-Ensembling Mixture of Experts (WEMoE) module that can dynamically integrate shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input sample. This provides a more flexible solution that adapts to the needs of each instance.

3. It conducts extensive experiments on conventional multi-task model merging as well as evaluating generalization ability and robustness. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and provide a comprehensive understanding.

In summary, the key innovation is the WEMoE module that separates shared and task-specific knowledge and combines them dynamically based on the input. This helps mitigate the parameter interference problem and creates a flexible multi-task model. The method is validated through multi-task merging experiments and analysis of generalization and robustness.

7. The method introduces additional parameters in the router and task vectors. Discuss the inference cost implications. Is further optimization possible to restrict the parameter overhead?   

8. How does the proposed method conceptually differ from existing model merging techniques? What limitations of prior work does it aim to address?

9. The method dynamically combines shared and task-specific knowledge based on the input. Why is a static solution with fixed task vector scaling insufficient? Explain with diagrams.
