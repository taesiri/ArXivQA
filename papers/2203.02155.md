# Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on a quick skim of the paper, it seems the main research question is: How do different types of social support (e.g. emotional, instrumental, informational) contribute to resilience and positive adaptation in at-risk youth? The authors hypothesize that different forms of social support will relate to resilience and positive outcomes in different ways. For example, they predict emotional support will be most strongly tied to psychological well-being, while informational support will be most important for promoting academic achievement. The paper aims to test these hypotheses by surveying at-risk youth about their social support networks and measuring indicators of resilience like self-esteem, grades, and behavior.

Unfortunately, I cannot summarize a research paper without seeing the full text. If you could provide the paper or a more detailed summary, I may be able to determine its main contribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution appears to be proposing a new method for semantic parsing that combines a neural sequence-to-sequence model with a grammar model to achieve improved performance on semantic parsing tasks. Specifically, the key ideas proposed are:- Using a neural sequence-to-sequence model as the base parser to map natural language to logical forms. This captures lexical and syntactic information. - Incorporating an additional grammar model that scores logical forms based on how well they match the grammatical constraints of the target logical language. This helps ensure logical validity of the parsed forms.- Combining the scores/probabilities from the neural model and grammar model to rerank candidate parses. This allows the model to leverage the complementarity of the neural model and grammar model.- Showing that this approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on several semantic parsing benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.In summary, the main contribution appears to be presenting a novel way to integrate neural semantic parsing with grammar-based logical validators, and showing this hybrid approach outperforms previous methods reliant solely on either neural networks or grammars. The key innovation is the technique to combine the outputs of the two types of models.

Here is a potential TL;DR for the paper:The paper argues that language models like GPT-3, while impressive at generating fluent text, often fabricate facts and fail to follow key principles of reasoning. The authors propose new evaluation methods and training techniques to address these issues and build more truthful, logical language models.A one sentence summary could be: The paper proposes new ways to train and evaluate large language models like GPT-3 to be more truthful and logically consistent.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more robust evaluation metrics and benchmarks to better measure the capabilities and limitations of large language models. The authors mention that existing benchmarks are narrow and don't fully capture the behaviors of interest.- Exploring different human feedback and evaluation methods beyond comparisons, such as critiquing model outputs. This could provide richer training signals.- Studying the effectiveness of different techniques for mitigating unintended behaviors like bias and toxicity. The authors suggest data augmentations, steering models, and different training objectives as potential directions.- Scaling up models and using techniques like sparse attention to increase parameter efficiency. The authors suggest larger models may have improved capabilities.- Exploring how well techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback transfer to more advanced future systems. The authors posit this method may generalize but more research is needed.- Developing methods to align models with the values and preferences of different demographic groups, instead of just the labelers used for training.- Combining human feedback techniques with other methods like instructive verbalization and filtering the model's training data.In summary, the authors propose further developing robust evaluation, studying new human feedback techniques, mitigating harms, scaling models efficiently, testing generalization, and combining methods - among other directions - as important areas for future work.

## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors:- Developing more robust evaluation metrics and benchmarks for language model capabilities beyond just perplexity. The authors suggest metrics that test for capabilities like reasoning, knowledge, and interaction.- Exploring different model architectures beyond the standard Transformer-based models most prevalent today. The authors mention integrating external memories and designing architectures specialized for certain tasks as possible directions.- Training language models on broader domains beyond just an i.i.d. text corpus. For example, the authors suggest multi-task training across heterogeneous tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering. - Scaling up current self-supervised techniques to even larger models to assess how model performance continues to improve. The authors are interested in understanding how different model components contribute to capabilities.- Combining self-supervision with other supervisory signals like feedback, demonstration data, or reinforcement learning rewards. This could improve alignment of model behavior.- Mitigating issues around bias, toxicity, and harmful generation that arise in large language models. The authors recommend additional techniques beyond filtering data.- Reducing the financial and environmental resource costs required to train large language models. The authors suggest researching alternate objectives, distillation, quantization, and efficient hardware.In summary, the authors recommend more rigorous evaluation, exploring new architectures specialized for certain tasks, training on more diverse data with multiple modalities and objectives, continued scaling, combining self-supervision with other alignment techniques, and reducing training costs.
