# [Analysis of Internet of Things implementation barriers in the cold   supply chain: an integrated ISM-MICMAC and DEMATEL approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01804)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
Implementing Internet of Things (IoT) technology in cold supply chains (CSCs) can enhance efficiency and quality, but faces barriers needing thorough examination. There is a lack of scholarly focus on examining IoT adoption challenges specific to complex CSC environments with stringent temperature control and perishable goods logistics. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper employs an integrated Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to analyze barriers hindering IoT implementation in CSCs. Surveys gather expert judgments on 13 identified barriers. ISM determines interactions and hierarchy of barriers while DEMATEL evaluates barrier impact intensities.  

Key Contributions:

- Identifies 13 key IoT adoption barriers through a systematic literature review focused specifically on CSCs.

- Applies a rigorous survey-based methodology and statistical tests to validate collected data on barrier relationships.

- Uses ISM modeling to determine connections and hierarchical levels among barriers, highlighting critical bottlenecks. 

- Leverages DEMATEL technique to quantify causal relationships and barrier impact magnitudes on the system.

- Reveals that "regularity compliance" and "cold chain networks" represent fundamental barriers driving IoT adoption strategies, while "reliability issues", "acceptance and adoption", and "high implementation costs" are key affected outcomes.

- Provides guidance to CSC enterprises, governments and technology developers on recognizing and overcoming obstacles to optimize IoT integration and boost supply chain effectiveness.

In summary, the paper makes valuable contributions by offering an in-depth look at IoT adoption barriers through a tailored ISM-DEMATEL approach focused specifically on intricate cold supply chain settings. The findings inform strategic decisions to smooth IoT implementation.
