# [A Novel Dataset for Financial Education Text Simplification in Spanish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text simplification is important to make complex texts more understandable, especially for specific groups like visually impaired Spanish speakers. 
- There is a lack of high-quality Spanish text simplification datasets, especially for specialized domains like financial education.
- Existing datasets have limitations like small size, lack of transparency around simplification rules used, and not targeting specific populations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors created a new Spanish financial education text simplification dataset called FEINA with 5,314 complex/simplified sentence pairs.
- They developed a comprehensive set of 21 text simplification rules tailored to the needs of visually impaired individuals who use screen readers. 
- The sentences were manually simplified by 6 advanced philology students using these rules.

Main Contributions:
- The first financial education text simplification dataset in Spanish focused on the needs of the visually impaired.
- Analysis of the quality of manual simplifications compared to machine simplifications from GPT-3, Tuner and MT5 using a variety of automatic metrics and human evaluation.
- Findings show manual and GPT-3 simplifications were best, with GPT-3 showing promise for data augmentation.
- The new dataset and analysis provide valuable benchmark and insights to advance text simplification research for Spanish and for specialized target populations.

In summary, the key innovation is a new Spanish financial text simplification dataset filling an important gap, along with insightful analysis comparing human and machine simplifications using multiple evaluation techniques. This can facilitate further advancement of inclusive text simplification systems.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new Spanish financial text simplification dataset of 5,314 complex/simplified sentence pairs for the blind using manual rules, compares it to machine-generated simplifications from GPT-3, Tuner and MT5 on various metrics, and finds GPT-3 closest in quality to the manual gold standard.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) A set of text simplification rules designed specifically for Spanish aimed at enhancing the comprehensibility of financial education texts for individuals with visual impairments who rely on screen readers. 

2) A new text simplification dataset in Spanish for the financial education domain consisting of 5,314 complex/simplified sentence pairs generated manually using the defined simplification rules. This dataset is referred to as FEINA.

3) An evaluation of the quality and reliability of the manually generated dataset compared to automatically generated datasets from systems like GPT-3, Tuner, and MT5. This was done to assess the feasibility of using these systems for data augmentation in text simplification.

4) An analysis of various metrics - reference-less, reference-based, and human evaluation metrics - to quantify the quality of simplification and compare the performance of the different systems. The manually generated and GPT-3 datasets showed the best performance overall.

In summary, the main contribution is a new Spanish text simplification dataset for the financial domain focused on the needs of visually impaired individuals, along with a thorough evaluation of its quality compared to other systems. This provides valuable data and insights to drive further research in this area.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces a new dataset called FEINA for text simplification in the domain of financial education for visually impaired people. What was the process used to create this dataset and what simplification rules were developed? Can you describe them in detail?

2. The paper compares the FEINA dataset against automatic text simplifications from systems like GPT-3, Tuner and MT5. What metrics were used to evaluate the quality of simplifications from these systems? Can you explain the key findings? 

3. The authors use both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the quality of text simplifications. What were the main results from the human evaluations? How did the human scores compare between the manual, GPT-3, Tuner and MT5 datasets?

4. One of the goals mentioned in the paper is using systems like GPT-3 for data augmentation in text simplification. Based on the analysis done in the paper, do you think GPT-3 shows potential for generating additional training data? Why or why not?

5. What are some of the main challenges in creating text simplification systems and datasets according to the authors? How does the FEINA dataset aim to address some of these challenges?

6. How does the paper argue that quality text simplification datasets can increase inclusiveness for people with disabilities? Do you agree with this viewpoint? Why or why not?

7. The paper uses both reference-less and reference-based automatic evaluation metrics. Can you explain the difference between these two types of metrics and how they were used to evaluate system outputs?  

8. What ideas does the paper present for future work in Spanish text simplification for financial education? What aspects need further research?

9. One insight from the paper is that current text simplification metrics may not adequately measure meaning preservation. What evidence supports this claim? How might new or improved metrics be developed?

10. The paper aims to create resources for an underserved group and domain - visually impaired people needing simplified financial texts. How well does their presented solution achieve this goal? What further efforts are needed in your opinion?
