# [A Novel Dataset for Financial Education Text Simplification in Spanish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Text simplification is important to make complex texts more understandable, especially for specific groups like visually impaired Spanish speakers. 
- There is a lack of high-quality Spanish text simplification datasets, especially for specialized domains like financial education.
- Existing datasets have limitations like small size, lack of transparency around simplification rules used, and not targeting specific populations.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors created a new Spanish financial education text simplification dataset called FEINA with 5,314 complex/simplified sentence pairs.
- They developed a comprehensive set of 21 text simplification rules tailored to the needs of visually impaired individuals who use screen readers. 
- The sentences were manually simplified by 6 advanced philology students using these rules.

Main Contributions:
- The first financial education text simplification dataset in Spanish focused on the needs of the visually impaired.
- Analysis of the quality of manual simplifications compared to machine simplifications from GPT-3, Tuner and MT5 using a variety of automatic metrics and human evaluation.
- Findings show manual and GPT-3 simplifications were best, with GPT-3 showing promise for data augmentation.
- The new dataset and analysis provide valuable benchmark and insights to advance text simplification research for Spanish and for specialized target populations.

In summary, the key innovation is a new Spanish financial text simplification dataset filling an important gap, along with insightful analysis comparing human and machine simplifications using multiple evaluation techniques. This can facilitate further advancement of inclusive text simplification systems.
