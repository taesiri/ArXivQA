# [Enhancing Systematic Decompositional Natural Language Inference Using   Informal Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14798)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Recent work on explainable AI seeks to make complex systems like large language models (LLMs) more transparent through entailment tree-based reasoning. However, most prior work focuses on end-task accuracy rather than the validity of the reasoning trees themselves. It's possible for a system to arrive at the right conclusion but through flawed reasoning steps.  
- There has been a lack of clarity around what constitutes a valid decompositional entailment, which is critical for entailment tree algorithms. Prior datasets exhibit low internal consistency. Clear protocols are needed.

Proposed Solution:  
- The paper formulates a consistent, theoretically grounded approach to annotating decompositional entailment datasets, drawing inspiration from criteria in informal logic: relevance, acceptability, sufficiency (RAS).
- They collect expert annotations on 1000 decompositions from science QA and Wikipedia QA tasks to form the Recognizing Decompositional Textual Entailment (RDTE) dataset. RDTE has much higher internal annotator agreement than prior datasets.
- They show nearly all models, including LLMs, perform poorly on RDTE, validating it as a challenging test set.
- They demonstrate a knowledge distillation pipeline using GPT-4 as a teacher to train specialized student models for discriminating valid/invalid decompositions. The student models outperform prior methods on RDTE.

Contributions:
- RDTE dataset with 1000 annotated decompositions based on a rigorous protocol 
- Knowledge distillation pipeline to teach student models to identify valid decompositions
- TreeWise: a new state-of-the-art entailment tree engine that benefits from the RDTE student models, outperforming prior QA methods while also generating higher quality trees

The paper makes an important advance around formulating what constitutes a valid decompositional inference, resulting in cleaner data, better models, and improved reasoning systems. The introduced framework paves the way for more trustworthy AI systems.
