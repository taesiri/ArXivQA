# [Improving Language Model Negotiation with Self-Play and In-Context   Learning from AI Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10142)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

Can multiple large language models autonomously improve each other's negotiation skills through self-play and learning from AI feedback, with minimal human intervention?

The key points are:

- The authors aim to study if LLMs can improve themselves in a negotiation game setting by playing against each other, reflecting on their strategies, and providing constructive feedback to their peer through another LLM acting as a "critic." 

- This is inspired by AlphaGo Zero, where AI systems learned to master Go through self-play with minimal human knowledge. The authors want to explore if a similar self-improvement is possible for LLMs in a natural language game.

- The negotiation game involves a "seller" LLM trying to sell a product at a higher price, and a "buyer" LLM trying to buy it at a lower price. After each round, a "critic" LLM gives feedback to help one player improve their strategy. 

- The goal is to see if the LLMs can continuously improve their negotiation performance over multiple rounds by incorporating history, feedback, and self-reflection with minimal human input.

- This tests the models' ability to understand game rules, strategize, incorporate natural language feedback, and exhibit long-term improvement, which are non-trivial capabilities.

- The central hypothesis seems to be that sufficiently capable and well-aligned LLMs can demonstrate autonomous self-improvement in a multi-agent negotiation game setting through self-play and AI feedback. The experiments aim to test this hypothesis.

In summary, the key research question is whether LLMs can autonomously improve each other in a negotiation game with minimal human intervention, by leveraging self-play and AI feedback. The paper seeks to experimentally explore this possibility.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The paper proposes a method for improving language models' negotiating skills by having them engage in a bargaining game and provide iterative AI feedback to each other. The key ideas and contributions are:

- They have multiple LLMs play a negotiation game, with one model acting as the "seller" trying to sell a product at a higher price, another model acting as the "buyer" trying to buy it at a lower price, and a third model acting as a "critic" that provides feedback to the seller or buyer to help improve their negotiating strategy. 

- They use an "in-context learning from AI feedback" (ICL-AIF) approach where the feedback from the critic model and negotiation dialog history are provided as demonstrations to prompt the next round of negotiation. This allows the models to iteratively improve without needing explicit fine-tuning.

- They find that only the most capable models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude can actually continuously improve over multiple rounds of negotiation and feedback. Weaker models either don't understand the rules of the game or can't effectively incorporate the feedback.

- The buyer role seems to be more difficult to improve than the seller role. Models playing as buyers are less able to benefit from the feedback compared to playing as sellers.

- There is a tradeoff between improving the deal price and the likelihood of reaching a deal. As models get better at negotiating, they are also more likely to fail to reach a deal.

- The negotiation responses become more verbose and strategic after multiple rounds of feedback, evidencing an improvement in language complexity and bargaining tactics.

Overall, the key contribution is showing the promise of using self-play and AI feedback for iteratively improving LLMs' skills in a strategic dialog setting like negotiation, while also revealing the limitations of current models. The results have implications for developing autonomous agents and improving models with minimal human oversight.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using multiple large language models to autonomously improve each other in a textual negotiation game through self-play and learning from AI feedback, showing the possibility of creating strong AI agents with minimal human intervention but also highlighting risks around oversight and alignment.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work:

- The idea of having AI agents learn and improve through self-play in games has been explored in prior work like AlphaGo Zero. However, this paper focuses specifically on using natural language for the game and feedback, rather than something like the game of Go. So it aims to explore these ideas more in the context of language models and dialog.

- The use of in-context learning from demonstrations is related to prior work on few-shot prompting and in-context learning for language models. This paper applies those techniques to the setting of iteratively improving agents through self-play. It provides evidence that in-context learning can work for this purpose.

- There has been growing interest recently in understanding and improving the capabilities of large language models through multi-turn dialog tasks. This work contributes by proposing a new dialog-based game setting that requires strategic negotiation skills. The game provides a testbed for analyzing model capabilities.

- The idea of having one model provide feedback to improve another model relates to work on recursive self-improvement and constitutional AI. This paper explores a simplified version of that, with one "critic" model giving feedback to a "player" model.

- Compared to standard reinforcement learning approaches, this work relies purely on natural language feedback rather than numeric rewards. The finding that language feedback can work is an interesting contribution.

In summary, this paper builds on several existing ideas like self-play, in-context learning, dialog agents, and learning from feedback. But it combines these in a novel way for the task of improving negotiation skills of language models, while also providing analysis of model capabilities and limitations. The simple game setting is a strength that provides a controlled way to study these ideas.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest include:

1. Considering global optimization over multiple rounds of negotiation, rather than optimizing for the deal price in each individual round. The paper showed a tradeoff between improving the deal price and the risk of failing to reach a deal. Optimizing over multiple rounds could potentially achieve better long-term outcomes.

2. Studying how different roles (buyer vs. seller) influence the ability of models to improve from feedback. The authors found that buyer models tended to be harder to improve than seller models. Further investigating this asymmetry could provide insights.

3. Exploring different game scenarios beyond bargaining. The authors mentioned trying more complex games like board games and RPGs in preliminary experiments, but found current agents struggled to understand the rules. As capabilities improve, revisiting more complex games could be interesting. 

4. Comparing human vs. AI feedback more systematically. The paper showed AI feedback can be comparable to human feedback in improving negotiation skills. But a more thorough comparison could reveal differences in the types of feedback provided.

5. Considering multi-agent alignment issues that arise when models are improving autonomously. The paper pointed out oversight becomes more difficult, so research into alignment and interpretability could help ensure safety.

6. Trying different optimization approaches beyond in-context learning. For example, using reinforcement learning to directly fine-tune the models for negotiation skills. Comparing optimization methods would be informative.

In summary, potential directions involve studying multi-round optimization, role asymmetry, game complexity, human feedback, alignment, and different optimization techniques. Improving understanding in these areas could build on the initial results demonstrated in this paper.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an approach called In-Context Learning from AI Feedback (ICL-AIF) to improve the negotiation skills of large language models (LLMs) in a bargaining game setting. The authors set up a game where two LLMs play the roles of a seller and buyer, aiming to negotiate the best deal price for a product. After each round, a third LLM acting as a critic provides feedback to one player to help them improve their strategy. By using the feedback and dialog history as demonstrations for few-shot in-context learning, the players can continuously enhance their negotiation skills over multiple rounds of the game. Experiments with models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude show that only the most capable models are able to successfully play the game and incorporate critic feedback to achieve better prices over time. The results have implications for creating strong AI agents with minimal human input, as well as oversight and alignment challenges due to autonomous self-improvement. Overall, the work represents an initial exploration of LLMs using self-play and AI feedback to iteratively enhance performance on a well-defined textual task.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper studies whether large language models (LLMs) can autonomously improve each other in a negotiation game setting by playing the roles of a buyer and seller, providing feedback, and incorporating feedback to improve their negotiation strategies. The authors set up a bargaining game between a buyer LLM and a seller LLM, with the goal of reaching a deal on a product price within a predefined range. After each round, a third critic LLM provides feedback to one player on how to improve their negotiation strategy. The player LLM then incorporates this feedback when negotiating in the next round against the same rival LLM which has no memory of prior rounds. Multiple rounds of negotiation with iterative feedback are conducted.  

The key findings are: (1) Only a subset of LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude v1.3) exhibit the capabilities required for this task, including understanding the game rules, providing meaningful feedback, and continuously improving strategies over multiple rounds of negotiation. (2) Playing as buyer seems to be a harder role than seller for improving from feedback. (3) There is a tradeoff between achieving better prices vs higher risk of failing to reach a deal when incorporating feedback to be more aggressive in subsequent rounds. The results suggest the possibility of iteratively improving LLMs from self-play and AI feedback alone, but also highlight challenges around goal misalignment across roles.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper introduces GPT-Bargaining, an approach that allows multiple large language models (LLMs) to autonomously improve each other in a negotiation game setting with minimal human intervention. The key method is to have two LLMs play the roles of buyer and seller, negotiating to reach a deal on the price of a product. After each round, a third LLM acting as a critic provides textual feedback to help one of the players improve their negotiation strategy. The players then play another round, where the player receiving feedback leverages the critic's suggestions as well as the dialog history from previous rounds to negotiate better. By iteratively playing the game and incorporating feedback, the LLMs are able to continuously enhance their negotiation skills with no human involvement beyond the initial game setup. The deal price achieved serves as a quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of each LLM's learned negotiation strategies. This approach of having LLMs learn from self-play and AI feedback draws inspiration from AlphaGo Zero's self-improvement through game playing.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction, this paper appears to be addressing the following main question:

Can multiple large language models (LLMs) autonomously improve each other's negotiation skills in a bargaining game, with minimal human intervention, by playing the game iteratively and providing feedback to each other?

The key aspects this paper is exploring are:

- Whether LLMs can play a negotiation game with clear rules and objectives (lower/higher deal price). This requires understanding the game and negotiating strategically.

- Whether LLMs can provide constructive feedback to each other in natural language after playing a round, and incorporate that feedback to improve their negotiation strategy in the next round. This tests their ability to learn from AI feedback.

- Whether the LLMs can continuously improve their negotiation skills over multiple rounds of playing the game and iteratively incorporating feedback. This tests their capability for long-term learning.

The motivation seems to be investigating if LLMs can learn complex skills like negotiation in an autonomous, self-supervised fashion, similar to how AlphaGo Zero learned to play Go. This could significantly reduce the need for large labeled training datasets.

The paper examines whether current LLMs exhibit the capabilities required for such autonomous iterative learning in a multi-agent competitive/cooperative game setting. The bargaining game with feedback provides a testbed to evaluate this.

In summary, this paper explores whether and how well LLMs can learn complex skills from self-play and AI feedback alone, reducing the need for human involvement. The results have implications for developing capable and scalable self-supervised learning methods for LLMs.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes having multiple LLMs improve each other autonomously in a negotiation game setting. However, how would this method generalize to more complex games with imperfect information or incomplete knowledge? Negotiation assumes both parties have full information, but many real-world strategic interactions involve hidden information.

2. The method relies on a third LLM acting as a critic to provide feedback to the negotiating agents. What techniques could be used to ensure the critic provides useful, constructive feedback instead of being adversarial? How can the critic's incentives be aligned with improving the negotiators?

3. The paper uses the deal price as the metric for evaluating negotiation performance. However, in many real-world negotiations, the goal is an agreement that maximizes payoff for both parties. How could the method be extended to optimize for Pareto efficient outcomes instead of just price?

4. The negotiation game has a clear objective function of price to optimize. How well would this autonomous improvement approach work for more subjective domains like storytelling or dialogue where there is no single metric for improvement? 

5. The paper studies only two-party negotiation. How could this approach extend to negotiations with multiple parties and more complex dynamics? What new challenges arise in improving negotiation strategies in these settings?

6. The paper uses in-context learning to improve the negotiators. How would the results differ if models were actually fine-tuned with reinforcement learning and negotiation experience? What are the tradeoffs between these approaches?

7. How robust is the approach to different selection of LLM engines? Does the method still work if very different LLMs are used for the negotiators and critic rather than similar models?

8. How does the complexity of the negotiation scenario impact the ability of LLMs to improve autonomously? Are there negotiations simple enough that no feedback is required or too complex for current LLMs to learn?

9. The paper studies iterative improvement over multiple rounds of negotiation. Is there an upper limit or plateau to how much autonomous agents can improve with more experience? What factors determine this limit?

10. The paper focuses on improving negotiation skills, but the approach could also lead to deception, collusion, or exploitation. How can the method prevent unethical behavior while still improving negotiation ability? What safety constraints need to be imposed?
