# [Look into the Mirror: Evolving Self-Dual Bent Boolean Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11884)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper explores using evolutionary algorithms to evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions, a subclass of bent Boolean functions that are equal to (the complement of) their dual. The authors conduct extensive experiments with two encodings (bitstring and tree-based genetic programming) and two fitness functions to directly evolve such functions up to 16 variables, successfully finding them in every dimension. They compare results to simply evolving for bent functions and notice a similar level of difficulty, with anti-self-dual optimization even achieving better nonlinearity. Additionally, the paper investigates secondary constructions of (anti-)self-dual bent functions by evolving Boolean expressions combining smaller seed bent functions, but without success. The results demonstrate the promise of metaheuristics for evolving this rare subclass of Boolean functions. Key findings include the superiority of the tree encoding, the ability to consistently find target functions up to 16 variables, and the comparative difficulty being no higher than for generic bent functions. The paper also identifies construction evolution as an open problem for future work.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation of using evolutionary algorithms to evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions, both by direct search and by evolving secondary constructions, showing that direct search with a tree-based genetic programming representation can successfully find such functions up to 16 variables but evolving reusable constructions remains an open challenge.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper investigates using evolutionary algorithms to evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions, which are a rare subset of bent Boolean functions that are equal to (or the complement of) their dual function. The authors experiment with directly evolving such functions as well as evolving secondary constructions, considering Boolean functions with up to 16 variables. They find that a tree-based genetic programming representation is efficient in directly evolving self-dual bent functions for all tested dimensions, achieving comparable difficulty to regular bent functions. Interestingly, optimizing for anti-self-dual functions resulted in better nonlinearity levels. However, evolving secondary constructions was not successful. The paper provides a systematic analysis of the problem using different representations and fitness functions, demonstrating when the evolutionary approach succeeds and fails in this domain. Key open questions remain regarding construction evolution and further constraining the search space by combining self-duality with other bent function subclasses.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation of using evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic programming, to evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions, a subclass of bent Boolean functions that is more constrained and rare; the experiments successfully construct such functions up to 16 variables with a tree-based encoding, while a bitstring encoding and attempts to evolve secondary constructions are less effective.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question or hypothesis appears to be:

Can evolutionary algorithms be used to effectively evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions, either by directly evolving such functions or by evolving secondary constructions for them?

The paper conducts an extensive experimental evaluation to assess the feasibility of using evolutionary algorithms, specifically genetic programming, to find (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions. It considers different encodings (bitstring and tree-based GP), different fitness functions, and both directly evolving such functions as well as trying to evolve algebraic constructions for them. The goal is to determine if and how well evolutionary algorithms can solve this problem, which involves finding rare subclasses of bent Boolean functions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. The authors are the first to consider using metaheuristics specifically to evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions. They use evolutionary algorithms with two solution representations (bitstring and tree encoding) and two fitness functions to evolve such functions with 8 to 16 inputs, successfully finding them with the tree encoding.

2. They show that evolving (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions has a similar level of difficulty for evolutionary algorithms as evolving general bent Boolean functions. Interestingly, optimizing just for nonlinearity leads to better results for anti-self-dual functions, even though intuitively self-dual and anti-self-dual functions should have the same difficulty.

3. When evolving (anti-)self-dual bent functions with 16 variables, they manage to find such functions, while their experiments for evolving general bent functions of 16 variables did not succeed. This indicates that constraining the search to a subclass can even be beneficial for metaheuristics when the number of variables is large.

4. They investigate evolving secondary constructions of (anti-)self-dual bent functions, but these experiments do not result in any successful constructions. So this remains an open research question.

In summary, the main contribution is using evolutionary algorithms to successfully evolve (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions directly, showing the level of difficulty is similar to evolving general bent functions, and posing the evolution of secondary constructions as an open problem.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper makes several notable contributions compared to previous work on evolving bent Boolean functions:

1. It is the first work to specifically focus on evolving the subclass of (anti-)self-dual bent Boolean functions using metaheuristics. Most prior research has focused on evolving general bent Boolean functions or other subclasses like rotation symmetric bent functions.

2. The experiments show that evolving (anti-)self-dual bent functions seems similarly difficult as evolving general bent Boolean functions. This is an interesting finding since (anti-)self-dual functions are much rarer, so one may expect the search to be harder when adding the duality constraint. 

3. For 16 variables, the constrained search for (anti-)self-dual actually succeeded in finding bent functions in some runs, while optimizing just for nonlinearity failed to find any bent functions. This indicates constraining to a rare subclass can sometimes even help the search when the number of variables is high.

4. The paper thoroughly investigates different encodings (bitstring and tree-based GP), fitness functions, and also attempts secondary constructions. This provides a very systematic evaluation of different search strategies for this new problem.

5. The negative result on secondary constructions is itself an important contribution since such constructions are known to exist. It remains an open question why the evolutionary algorithms failed to rediscover any known constructions.

In summary, this paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art by systematically studying for the first time how to evolve an important subclass of bent Boolean functions that has received little attention so far regarding metaheuristic construction. Several interesting insights are gained by comparison with evolving the general class of bent functions.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on the conclusions in the paper, the authors suggest the following future research directions:

1) Understand why the construction approach did not succeed in evolving secondary constructions of (anti)-self-dual bent functions. Options include allowing the seed functions to have different dimensions.

2) Evolve primary constructions of (anti)-self-dual bent functions, where no seed functions are required.

3) Consider evolving an even smaller subset of (anti)-self-dual bent functions, such as those that are also rotation symmetric (invariant under cyclic shift). The authors state that it is not known in general if such functions exist.

4) Since evolving (anti)-self-dual bent functions turned out to be simpler than expected, the authors suggest trying to make the problem more difficult, for example by adding additional constraints. This could make it a better benchmark problem.

In summary, the main suggestions are to investigate why construction approaches failed, explore primary constructions, add additional constraints to make the problem more difficult, and look into subclasses like rotation symmetric (anti)-self-dual bent functions.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper for evolving self-dual bent Boolean functions:

1. The paper mentions that self-dual bent Boolean functions are much rarer than regular bent Boolean functions. Does this added constraint make the search problem inherently more difficult for evolutionary algorithms or not? Why?

2. The paper experiments with two fitness functions, $fit_1$ and $fit_2$. $fit_2$ incorporates both the number of correct Walsh-Hadamard spectrum values as well as the deviation from the expected values. In the end, the paper does not find significant differences between the two. Can you think of modifications to $fit_2$ or an entirely new fitness function that could better guide the search?

3. The paper shows that the tree-based genetic programming (GP) encoding clearly outperforms the bitstring encoding. However, other works have shown that Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) can be very effective for this task. How could CGP be adapted for the search for self-dual bent Boolean functions? What potential benefits or drawbacks do you see compared to the GP encoding used in the paper?

4. The paper attempted to evolve secondary constructions for self-dual bent Boolean functions but did not succeed. What are some reasons this could have failed? What modifications to the approach could you suggest to make finding such constructions more likely? 

5. The best nonlinearity levels achieved when directly optimizing for nonlinearity are higher than those achieved when optimizing for self-duality. Why could that be the case? Is there something inherent that makes achieving maximum nonlinearity more difficult when also requiring self-duality?

6. The paper shows the evolution of self-dual bent Boolean functions up to 16 variables. What challenges do you expect to arise when trying to scale further, to 20 variables or more? Would any modifications to the method be required?

7. The paper considers binary self-dual bent Boolean functions. Could the ideas be extended to evolve quaternary or higher alphabet self-dual bent functions? What potential issues need to be addressed?

8. The known primary and secondary constructions of self-dual bent Boolean functions have specific requirements for their components. What properties should the building blocks of an evolvable construction have that would make finding such constructions easier?

9. The paper uses a standard steady-state genetic algorithm. Do you think other evolutionary algorithms like differential evolution or particle swarm optimization could perform better on this problem? Why or why not?

10. What other subclasses of bent Boolean functions besides self-dual could be interesting targets for evolution? What potential benefits or challenges do you foresee compared to targeting self-dual functions?
