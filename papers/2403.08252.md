# [PNeSM: Arbitrary 3D Scene Stylization via Prompt-Based Neural Style   Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08252)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Existing 3D scene stylization methods couple scene geometry and appearance, requiring retraining for new scenes. They cannot transfer arbitrary styles to arbitrary 3D scenes using a single model.

Proposed Solution:  
The paper proposes a novel framework called Prompt-based Neural Style Mapping (PNeSM) to disentangle geometry and appearance and enable arbitrary style transfer to arbitrary 3D scenes without retraining. 

Key ideas:
1) Disentangle geometry and appearance by mapping 3D scene appearance to a 2D style pattern space using a UV mapping network.

2) Reconstruct original scene appearance by mapping UV coordinates to radiance color using an appearance mapping MLP.

3) Stylize the appearance in 2D style pattern space using a prompt-based 2D stylization algorithm. Integrate a visual prompt into a pre-trained 2D style transfer network to make it aware of scene geometry.

Main Contributions:

1) First framework to completely disentangle geometry and appearance of 3D scenes by mapping appearance to a 2D style pattern space. Enables arbitrary style transfer to arbitrary scenes with one model.

2) First to use prompt learning to adapt pre-trained 2D style transfer networks for 3D scene stylization. Simple yet effective way to improve quality.

3) Achieves state-of-the-art quality in stylizing unseen 3D scenes and styles without retraining. Demonstrates superiority over previous methods.

The key novelty is the idea of mapping 3D scene appearance to a 2D space to enable arbitrary stylization with one model. The use of prompt learning is also novel in making 2D style transfer networks aware of 3D geometry.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel 3D scene stylization framework called Prompt-based Neural Style Mapping (PNeSM) that can transfer arbitrary styles to arbitrary 3D scenes by disentangling geometry and appearance through mapping the appearance to a 2D style pattern space and stylizing it via a prompt-adapted 2D stylization network.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. It proposes a novel 3D scene stylization framework called PNeSM, which realizes complete disentanglement of geometry and appearance of 3D scenes by mapping the appearance into a 2D style pattern space. This allows the framework to be generalized to arbitrary 3D scenes without needing to retrain a separate stylized model for each new scene.

2. It is the first to explore the use of prompt learning to adapt pre-trained 2D image style transfer networks for 3D scene stylization. The visual prompt provides a simple yet effective way to make the stylization aware of and harmonious with the geometry of the scene. 

3. It demonstrates through extensive experiments that the proposed method can achieve high-quality stylization results when generalizing to both unseen styles and unseen 3D scenes. The method is shown to be superior to previous state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both visual quality and generalization ability.

In summary, the main contribution is a new framework for arbitrary 3D scene stylization that disentangles geometry and appearance, uses prompt learning for stylization, and generalizes very well to new styles and scenes.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes a UV mapping network to project 3D coordinates into a 2D style pattern space. How is this mapping network designed and trained? What loss functions are used to ensure a bijective mapping?

2. The paper uses a voxel-grid representation instead of MLP to model the UV mapping network. What are the advantages of using a voxel-grid over an MLP, especially in terms of training speed and reconstruction quality? 

3. The paper introduces a visual prompt that is integrated into the feature maps of a pre-trained 2D stylization network. Why is this visual prompt necessary and how does it help adapt the stylization network to be aware of geometric information?

4. The visual prompt is optimized using a geometry-aware stylization loss. What are the different terms in this loss function and how do they ensure the style patterns are harmonious with the scene geometry?

5. How does the paper qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate consistency of stylization across different views? What metrics are used?

6. What are the differences between scene-related and scene-agnostic training of the visual prompt? What determines how well the prompt can generalize to unseen scenes? 

7. The paper conducts an ablation study on using reconstruction appearance versus a noise image as content input. What causes the quality difference and how does the method address this?

8. What scene representations do the different baseline methods use for 3D scene stylization? How do these affect the quality of geometry and stylization?

9. Could the proposed framework be extended to stylize video sequences? What modifications would be required to maintain temporal consistency across frames?

10. How suitable is the proposed method for interactive or real-time stylization of dynamic 3D scenes? What performance optimization could be done?
