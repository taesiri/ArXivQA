# [Weatherproofing Retrieval for Localization with Generative AI and   Geometric Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
State-of-the-art visual localization methods rely on image retrieval as an initial step to provide an approximate pose estimate for further refinement. However, retrieval often struggles under varying conditions like weather, seasons, and times of day. This significantly impacts the final localization accuracy with dramatic consequences when the retrieved images are wrong in a consistent manner. Hence, improving the retrieval step for resilience to such variations is critical.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a retrieval framework, Ret4Loc, tailored for visual localization. First, it improves training of state-of-the-art retrieval models like HOW with better augmentations and optimization. Second, it leverages recent progress in text-to-image models to generate synthetic variants of training images corresponding to textual descriptions of weather, seasons, and times. These synthetic images, depicting scenes under varying conditions, are used to train the retrieval model for better invariance. 

Additionally, a geometric consistency score is proposed to automatically filter unreliable synthetic images using matching correspondences. The score measures change in matched features before and after altering images. It is used in two ways - to filter synthetic images during training, and to sample hard examples by weighting synthetic images proportional to change in correspondences.

Main Contributions:

- Tailor state-of-the-art image retrieval methods like HOW to visual localization via improved training
- Use text-prompts to automatically generate challenging synthetic variants of training images covering varying seasons, weather and times
- Filter unreliable synthetic images and sample useful hard examples using proposed geometric consistency score
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple outdoor and indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior retrieval models

The key novelty lies in using language-based image generation to expand the training set with targeted synthetic variants to improve resilience of retrieval models. Additionally, correspondences are leveraged to assess reliability of these generated variants unlike prior generative works. Experiments demonstrate consistent and significant gains across datasets and protocols.
