# [Weatherproofing Retrieval for Localization with Generative AI and   Geometric Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09237)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
State-of-the-art visual localization methods rely on image retrieval as an initial step to provide an approximate pose estimate for further refinement. However, retrieval often struggles under varying conditions like weather, seasons, and times of day. This significantly impacts the final localization accuracy with dramatic consequences when the retrieved images are wrong in a consistent manner. Hence, improving the retrieval step for resilience to such variations is critical.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a retrieval framework, Ret4Loc, tailored for visual localization. First, it improves training of state-of-the-art retrieval models like HOW with better augmentations and optimization. Second, it leverages recent progress in text-to-image models to generate synthetic variants of training images corresponding to textual descriptions of weather, seasons, and times. These synthetic images, depicting scenes under varying conditions, are used to train the retrieval model for better invariance. 

Additionally, a geometric consistency score is proposed to automatically filter unreliable synthetic images using matching correspondences. The score measures change in matched features before and after altering images. It is used in two ways - to filter synthetic images during training, and to sample hard examples by weighting synthetic images proportional to change in correspondences.

Main Contributions:

- Tailor state-of-the-art image retrieval methods like HOW to visual localization via improved training
- Use text-prompts to automatically generate challenging synthetic variants of training images covering varying seasons, weather and times
- Filter unreliable synthetic images and sample useful hard examples using proposed geometric consistency score
- Achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple outdoor and indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior retrieval models

The key novelty lies in using language-based image generation to expand the training set with targeted synthetic variants to improve resilience of retrieval models. Additionally, correspondences are leveraged to assess reliability of these generated variants unlike prior generative works. Experiments demonstrate consistent and significant gains across datasets and protocols.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes to improve the image retrieval step for visual localization by using generative AI to synthesize challenging variants of the training images corresponding to different weather, season, and time of day conditions, and employing geometric consistency strategies to select useful synthetic images.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Tailoring the training of retrieval models to the challenging task of long-term visual localization. This includes using strong data augmentations and improvements to the training process of existing retrieval methods like HOW.

2. Using language-based data augmentation with generative AI models to improve the robustness of retrieval models to adversarial daytime, weather and seasonal variations. Specifically, generating synthetic variants of training images using textual prompts that describe these variations.

3. Introducing geometry-based strategies, including a geometric consistency score, for filtering and sampling from the pool of synthetic images. This helps ensure the synthetic images preserve location-specific information crucial for visual localization.

4. Reporting significant gains in localization accuracy over the state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks, using retrieval models trained with real and synthetic images and the proposed geometric consistency strategies.

In summary, the main contribution is improving visual localization by tailoring image retrieval through augmented training data and strategies that leverage recent advances in generative AI and geometric verification. The key ideas are using language-based image generation to create challenging synthetic variants and geometry-based techniques to validate and sample them.
