# [Road Obstacle Detection based on Unknown Objectness Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18207)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Standard object detection methods cannot identify unknown objects that do not belong to predefined categories. This is an issue for safe autonomous driving, as unknown obstacles on the road need to be detected. Recently proposed pixel-wise anomaly detection methods based on semantic segmentation networks can detect unknown regions, but their performance is often unstable when applied to complex driving scenes.

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel method to achieve stable detection of unknown driving obstacles by combining principles of pixel-wise anomaly detection and object detection. The method uses a semantic segmentation network with a sigmoid output head, which provides both pixel-wise anomaly scores (unknown scores) and objectness scores. The unknown scores measure how unlikely a pixel belongs to any predefined class, while the objectness scores measure how likely a pixel belongs to some object. By multiplying the two scores, an "unknown objectness score" is defined, which detects pixels that are not from predefined classes but look like objects, meaning potential unknown obstacles. Additional components include using an object class to supervise obstacle pixels and weigh boundary pixels more in the loss to reduce false positives.

Main Contributions:
- Proposes a new anomaly score called unknown objectness score that combines pixel-wise anomaly scores and objectness scores for detecting unknown driving obstacles.
- Outperforms previous pixel-wise anomaly detection methods on public datasets without using additional networks or post-processing.
- Framework based on a sigmoid segmentation network allows supervision from limited obstacle data without needing new classes.
- Reduces false positive predictions compared to generic unknown region detection, especially in background areas.
- Detection focused specifically on unknown objects rather than all anomaly regions suits the driving obstacle detection task.

In summary, the paper presents a novel and effective approach for detecting unknown driving obstacles by integrating anomaly detection with object detection principles using outputs from a semantic segmentation network. The method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.
