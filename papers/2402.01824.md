# [Identification of Cognitive Decline from Spoken Language through Feature   Selection and the Bag of Acoustic Words Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01824)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Early diagnosis of memory disorders and cognitive decline is important for patient wellbeing and maintaining functional capacity. However, standardized speech tests are lacking in clinical settings.  
- Prior work has shown acoustic properties of speech can help rapidly diagnose diseases, but methods often use complex features, demand significant training data, are computationally intensive, or overfit to patients.

Proposed Solution:
- Use acoustic-only features from spoken language, specifically the Geneva minimalistic parameter set (eGeMAPS) and relative speech pauses.
- Employ feature selection with random forest classifier to reduce number of features.
- Build Bag of Acoustic Words model, quantizing speech features into histograms.
- Classify control vs dementia patients using 6 classification methods. 
- Evaluate on ADReSS 2020 competition dataset from DementiaBank Pitt Corpus.

Main Contributions:
- Show only 25 acoustic features, emphasizing MFCC and F0 statistics, can achieve 75% accuracy in classifying dementia.
- Demonstrate features generalize to unseen test set and entire dataset using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation.
- Account for variability in cluster-based histogram formation through repeated initializations.
- Results competitive with state-of-the-art acoustic-only methods on same dementia dataset.
- Features language independent and method scalable to other speech databases/languages.

In summary, the paper presents an efficient acoustic-only framework for dementia detection from speech by careful feature selection and robust clustering for the bag of audio words model. The approach reaches accuracies on par with more complex acoustic models for this dataset.
