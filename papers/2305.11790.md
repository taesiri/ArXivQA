# [Prompting with Pseudo-Code Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11790)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes prompting large language models with pseudo-code instructions instead of natural language instructions. Why do the authors hypothesize that pseudo-code prompts may lead to better performance compared to natural language prompts? What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of using pseudo-code prompts?

2. The pseudo-code prompts created contain various elements like function prototypes, docstrings, comments etc. What is the rationale behind including these specific elements? How do they aim to provide a clear specification of the task?

3. The paper finds that prompts with full pseudo-code instructions lead to better performance compared to prompts with just the function prototype. Why might this be the case? What additional benefits might the full pseudo-code provide over just the function signature?

4. When comparing results across models, the code-trained models (CodeGen) seem to benefit more from pseudo-code prompting compared to natural language models like BLOOM. Why might code models be better suited to exploit structural/pseudo-code prompts? 

5. For QA tasks, the gains from using pseudo-code prompts are less pronounced, and natural language prompts seem adequate or sometimes even better. Why might this be the case? Are there certain types of QA tasks where pseudo-code prompts provide more benefits?

6. The paper studies the impact of using docstrings/comments from pseudo-code in natural language prompts. Under what conditions does adding these elements to natural language prompts seem to help? When does it not make a significant difference?

7. How precisely were the pseudo-code prompts created? What guidelines were followed to convert natural language instructions to pseudo-code? How was a balance achieved between conciseness and expressiveness?

8. The paper reports lower performance in 2-shot prompting compared to 0-shot. What factors might explain this behavior? How could the prompts be engineered to better exploit the few-shot examples?

9. The study focuses on a limited set of models and dataset. How could the analysis be extended to more models and wider variety of datasets/tasks in future work? What other probing studies could yield further insights?

10. The paper demonstrates the utility of pseudo-code prompting in a 0-shot setting without any fine-tuning. How do you think pseudo-code vs natural language prompting would compare in a full instruction tuning setup? What might be interesting to explore in this area?


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

Does prompting large language models with pseudo-code instructions help improve their performance compared to prompting with natural language instructions?

The key hypothesis seems to be that prompting with pseudo-code will lead to better results because pseudo-code provides less ambiguous instructions compared to natural language prompts.

In particular, the paper aims to:

1) Demonstrate that prompting large language models like BLOOM and CodeGen with pseudo-code results in improved performance across a variety of NLP tasks compared to prompting with natural language. 

2) Analyze the factors that contribute to the gains from pseudo-code prompting, including the use of code structure, docstrings/comments, and model scale.

3) Release a dataset of 132 pseudo-code prompts across 28 task types to enable further research into pseudo-code prompting.

So in summary, the central research question is whether pseudo-code prompting can boost performance of large language models, and if so, what are the key factors driving these improvements. The hypothesis is that pseudo-code will reduce ambiguity and enable clearer task specification.

Does prompting large language models with pseudo-code instructions improve their performance compared to prompting with natural language instructions?

The key hypothesis seems to be:

Prompting large language models with pseudo-code instructions will result in better performance compared to prompting with natural language instructions, owing to the more concise and less ambiguous nature of pseudo-code.

In particular, the paper explores:

- How model scale affects the efficacy of pseudo-code prompts 

- The impact of specific elements in pseudo-code like function names, docstrings, comments etc. on performance

So in summary, the central research question is whether pseudo-code prompting can boost LLM performance over natural language prompting, and the paper conducts experiments to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. The authors created a dataset of 132 pseudo-code prompts spanning 28 different task types, sourced from the SuperNaturalInstructions dataset. 

2. Through experiments on two large language model families - BLOOM and CodeGen, the authors demonstrated that prompting with pseudo-code instructions results in improved performance compared to prompting with natural language instructions. The gains were more pronounced for code-focused models like CodeGen.

3. Detailed ablation studies were conducted which showed that the performance gains from pseudo-code prompting come from multiple factors - clearer instructions, descriptive function names, docstrings/comments, and structure. 

4. The authors released the pseudo-code prompt dataset to enable further research on prompting large language models with pseudo-code.

In summary, the key contribution is showing empirically that prompting large language models with pseudo-code instead of natural language instructions can result in significant performance improvements on a diverse set of NLP tasks. The paper also sheds light on why pseudo-code prompting helps through comprehensive experiments and analysis.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other related research:

- This paper explores the idea of using pseudo-code prompts, rather than natural language prompts, to provide instructions to large language models. As far as I know, this is the first work explicitly examining pseudo-code prompts for instruction tuning. Other related works have looked at code prompts, but not specifically pseudo-code.

- The paper tests the effectiveness of pseudo-code prompts on a broad range of 132 NLP tasks. Most prior work on instruction tuning focuses on either a small set of tasks or tasks within a specific domain. Evaluating on such a wide variety of tasks makes the findings here more robust.

- The paper compares pseudo-code prompts to natural language prompts using the same set of tasks and evaluation metrics. This controlled experiment allows for a direct comparison to isolate the impact of the prompt style itself. Other works introducing new prompting approaches often lack this direct comparison.

- The paper examines the performance of both code-focused models like CodeGen and general language models like BLOOM. Looking at both model types provides insights into whether pseudo-code prompts are mainly helping due to structural priming in code models vs clearer instructions. 

- The ablation studies digging into the contributions of different pseudo-code elements (docstrings, comments, etc.) help provide a deeper understanding of why pseudo-code prompts are effective. The analysis is more detailed than in some related work.

- The paper studies how prompts can improve zero-shot and few-shot performance. Much work has focused just on few-shot prompting. Analyzing zero-shot prompting is important for understanding model capabilities without examples.

Overall, I would say this paper provides a quite thorough investigation of pseudo-code prompting, with detailed experiments and analysis compared to related works. The broad task coverage and model testing help demonstrate the general effectiveness of this prompting strategy.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related research:

Prior work has focused on natural language prompting or code prompting for programming tasks specifically. The authors created a new dataset of 132 pseudo-code prompts across 28 task types to enable this analysis.

- The paper provides an empirical evaluation of the efficacy of pseudo-code prompting by testing two language model families - BLOOM and CodeGen. The results demonstrate clear performance gains from pseudo-code prompting over natural language instructions across tasks. 

- The paper includes detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of various elements of pseudo-code prompts, like docstrings and code structure. This provides insights into why pseudo-code prompting is effective that were lacking in prior work.

- The scale of evaluation across 132 diverse tasks makes this one of the most extensive investigations into instruction prompting strategies for LLMs to date. Most prior work has focused on smaller benchmark datasets.

- Compared to related work by Zhang et al. on code prompting, this paper finds consistent benefits from pseudo-code across models and tasks, whereas Zhang et al. concluded code did not universally improve performance over natural language.

Overall, this paper significantly advances the understanding of prompt engineering by thoroughly evaluating pseudo-code prompting, demonstrating its effectiveness empirically, and shedding light on the source of its advantages. The scale and rigor of this analysis exceeds prior related work.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests a few potential future research directions:

1. Training and evaluating instruction-tuned models using pseudo-code instructions instead of natural language instructions. The authors find that pseudo-code prompts yield better performance, so it may be useful to explore instruction tuning with pseudo-code. 

2. Comparing chain-of-thought reasoning enabled by pseudo-code instructions to standard chain-of-thought reasoning with and without fine-tuning. The pseudo-code structure could lend itself well to explicit reasoning steps.

3. Using pseudo-code instructions to generate intermediate responses that models need to produce prior to the final response. This could encourage more step-by-step reasoning.

4. Exploring the efficacy of pseudo-code prompts at larger model scales, as the authors only experimented with models up to 7B parameters. Larger models with better reasoning capabilities may reduce the benefits of pseudo-code.

5. Evaluating on multi-lingual tasks, since the BLOOM model was trained on multiple languages but the study only used English tasks. The model design choices could affect comparative results.

6. Comparing code models like CodeGen to natural language models when both are trained on identical datasets. Training set differences also affect model capabilities.

In summary, the authors propose several interesting directions to better understand the benefits of pseudo-code prompting and reasoning for instruction tuning of large language models. Their work opens up many avenues for future research in this area.
