# [Prompting with Pseudo-Code Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11790)

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes prompting large language models with pseudo-code instructions instead of natural language instructions. Why do the authors hypothesize that pseudo-code prompts may lead to better performance compared to natural language prompts? What are some potential advantages and disadvantages of using pseudo-code prompts?

2. The pseudo-code prompts created contain various elements like function prototypes, docstrings, comments etc. What is the rationale behind including these specific elements? How do they aim to provide a clear specification of the task?

3. The paper finds that prompts with full pseudo-code instructions lead to better performance compared to prompts with just the function prototype. Why might this be the case? What additional benefits might the full pseudo-code provide over just the function signature?

4. When comparing results across models, the code-trained models (CodeGen) seem to benefit more from pseudo-code prompting compared to natural language models like BLOOM. Why might code models be better suited to exploit structural/pseudo-code prompts? 

5. For QA tasks, the gains from using pseudo-code prompts are less pronounced, and natural language prompts seem adequate or sometimes even better. Why might this be the case? Are there certain types of QA tasks where pseudo-code prompts provide more benefits?

6. The paper studies the impact of using docstrings/comments from pseudo-code in natural language prompts. Under what conditions does adding these elements to natural language prompts seem to help? When does it not make a significant difference?

7. How precisely were the pseudo-code prompts created? What guidelines were followed to convert natural language instructions to pseudo-code? How was a balance achieved between conciseness and expressiveness?

8. The paper reports lower performance in 2-shot prompting compared to 0-shot. What factors might explain this behavior? How could the prompts be engineered to better exploit the few-shot examples?

9. The study focuses on a limited set of models and dataset. How could the analysis be extended to more models and wider variety of datasets/tasks in future work? What other probing studies could yield further insights?

10. The paper demonstrates the utility of pseudo-code prompting in a 0-shot setting without any fine-tuning. How do you think pseudo-code vs natural language prompting would compare in a full instruction tuning setup? What might be interesting to explore in this area?
