# [Intrinsic analysis for dual word embedding space models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.0728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we mitigate the "exposure bias" problem in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for conditional text generation, where models are trained only with teacher forcing using ground truth labels and not exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training?

The key hypothesis proposed is that contrasting positive input-output pairs with negative pairs, to expose the model to both valid and incorrect variations of the inputs, can improve the generalization performance of seq2seq models. 

Specifically, the paper proposes a principled method called CLAPS (Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Seq2seq) to automatically generate "hard" positive and negative pairs to guide the model to better distinguish correct vs incorrect outputs. The negative pairs are generated by adding small perturbations to minimize conditional likelihood, while positive pairs are generated with larger perturbations to be far from the input embedding while preserving high likelihood.

The central hypothesis is that training seq2seq models with such automatically constructed difficult positive and negative pairs within a contrastive learning framework can mitigate exposure bias and improve generalization on unseen inputs.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution seems to be proposing a contrastive learning framework with adversarial perturbations to improve generalization for conditional text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question generation. 

Specifically, the key ideas are:

- Using contrastive learning to train the seq2seq model by maximizing similarity between positive pairs (input and target text) while minimizing similarity to negative pairs. This exposes the model to various valid and incorrect outputs during training.

- Generating "hard" positive and negative examples via adversarial perturbations, rather than using random non-target texts as negative examples. The adversarial examples are more difficult for the model to discriminate.

- Negative examples are generated by adding small perturbations to minimize the conditional likelihood of the target text. 

- Positive examples are generated by adding larger perturbations to maximize distance from the input while keeping conditional likelihood high.

- The adversarial positive and negative pairs guide the model to better distinguish correct vs incorrect outputs, improving generalization.

- Empirically showing the method improves performance on machine translation, summarization, and question generation over baselines.

So in summary, the key contribution is using principled adversarial perturbations to construct better positive/negative pairs for contrastive learning, which improves generalization for seq2seq text generation models. The gains are demonstrated on multiple text gen tasks.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a one sentence summary:

This paper proposes a contrastive learning framework called CLAPS that generates adversarial positive and negative examples to train sequence-to-sequence models, improving their generalization by exposing them to varied valid and incorrect outputs during training.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here is a summary of how it compares to other research in conditional text generation:

- The paper tackles the problem of exposure bias in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models for conditional text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question generation. Exposure bias refers to the fact that seq2seq models are typically trained only on ground truth sequences using teacher forcing, and are not exposed to their own incorrectly generated sequences during training. This is a well-known issue that hurts generalization.

- The paper proposes a contrastive learning approach to address exposure bias, by training the model to distinguish between positive input-output pairs and negative pairs constructed using adversarial perturbations. Using adversarial examples as negatives is novel compared to prior contrastive learning methods that use random non-targets.

- The proposed method of generating "hard" positive and negative pairs using adversarial perturbations is principled and avoids the issues with naive negative sampling. This approach to constructing meaningful contrastive examples seems unique to this paper. 

- The overall framework of contrastive learning for seq2seq is not entirely new, with some prior works like [CITATION] also exploring it. However, the adversarial perturbation approach makes the contrasts more meaningful.

- For conditional text generation tasks specifically, other methods to address exposure bias include reinforcement learning, scheduled sampling, GANs etc. The contrastive learning viewpoint is relatively less explored for these problems.

- The paper demonstrates strong empirical performance from the proposed techniques on multiple text gen tasks. The gains over baselines are quite significant.

- The method seems generic enough to extend to other seq2seq domains like speech, vision etc. The adversarial construction of positives/negatives is also a domain-agnostic framework applicable beyond text.

In summary, the paper introduces a new perspective on exposure bias through contrastive learning, and makes useful innovations in constructing meaningful contrasts using adversarial perturbations. The gains demonstrated over text generation baselines validate the utility of the approach. It compares favorably to prior attempts at tackling exposure bias.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring contrastive learning for sequence-to-sequence models on other domains like speech, vision, etc. The authors mention their method may be applicable to tasks like automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and video captioning. 

- Developing better methods for generating positive and negative examples. The authors mention their approach for constructing hard positive and negative pairs is a "principled method" but suggest there may be room for improvement.

- Applying contrastive learning more broadly to other conditional text generation tasks. The authors demonstrate their method on machine translation, summarization, and question generation, but suggest it could likely benefit other text generation problems as well.

- Investigating whether contrastive learning can help with semi-supervised or few-shot learning settings. The authors focus on standard supervised learning but contrastive methods have shown promise in low-resource regimes too.

- Extending contrastive learning for open-ended text generation. The tasks explored are conditional generation, suggesting exploration of unconstrained text generation.

- Developing complementary training objectives to contrastive learning. Combining contrastive methods with goals like smoothing the generator distribution could further improve quality.

In summary, the main future directions relate to applying contrastive learning more broadly across domains, tasks, and settings to further improve sequence-to-sequence learning. The authors provide a solid foundation and suggest several promising paths for follow-up research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called CLAPS (Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Seq2seq learning) to improve conditional text generation models like sequence-to-sequence models. The key idea is to use contrastive learning to train the model to distinguish between valid input-output pairs and invalid ones. However, randomly sampling negative examples from the batch is ineffective, especially for large pretrained models. So the authors propose to automatically generate "hard" positive and negative pairs - the negative examples are generated by adding small perturbations to the target sequence to minimize its likelihood under the model, while positive examples are generated with large perturbations but enforcing the likelihood to remain high. The contrastive learning with such hard examples helps the model better distinguish between valid and invalid outputs and improves generalization. Experiments on machine translation, summarization and question generation tasks show the proposed method CLAPS outperforms baselines.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework called CLAPS to improve conditional text generation with sequence-to-sequence models. The key idea is to contrast positive input-output pairs with negative pairs during training, in order to expose the model to both valid and incorrect outputs. However, constructing good positive and negative pairs is challenging. The paper introduces two techniques: generating "imposters" which are small perturbations of the targets that reduce conditional likelihood, and "distant targets" which are large perturbations of targets that maintain high likelihood. 

CLAPS is evaluated on machine translation, summarization, and question generation tasks. It significantly outperforms baselines like scheduled sampling and word dropout contrastive learning. The gains are attributed to the adversarial generation of hard positive and negative examples, which teaches the model to better discriminate between valid and invalid outputs. Qualitative analysis shows CLAPS can generate fluent imposters with altered semantics and distant targets with preserved semantics. The results demonstrate the efficacy of principled adversarial contrastive learning for conditional text generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework called CLAPS to mitigate the exposure bias problem in conditional text generation with sequence-to-sequence models. It generates hard negative examples by adding small perturbations to the target sequence representations to minimize the conditional likelihood, making them semantically dissimilar but close in the embedding space. It generates hard positive examples by adding large perturbations to push the representations away from the source while enforcing a high conditional likelihood through KL divergence minimization. This exposes the model to varied valid and invalid outputs for an input during training. The model is trained to maximize likelihood and contrast positive and negative pairs with a loss combining negative log-likelihood, KL divergence of positive examples, and contrastive loss. The hard adversarial examples help the model better distinguish correct and incorrect outputs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key problem it is addressing is the "exposure bias" issue in sequence-to-sequence learning for conditional text generation tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question generation. 

The main issue is that standard sequence-to-sequence models are usually trained with teacher forcing, where the ground truth output token is provided at each time step. This means the model is never exposed to its own incorrectly generated tokens during training. This can hurt the model's ability to generalize to unseen test data, since there will likely be errors that compound during inference/decoding.

To address this exposure bias problem, the paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to explicitly train the model to distinguish between valid (positive) input-output pairs and invalid (negative) pairs. The key contributions are:

1) Proposing a principled adversarial approach to generate "hard" negative examples that are semantically dissimilar but embeddingly similar to positive examples. 

2) Generating additional "hard" positive examples that are embeddingly dissimilar but semantically similar to the original input-output pair.

3) Showing that contrastive learning with such difficult positive and negative pairs helps the model generalize better by exposing it to a variety of correct and incorrect outputs during training.

4) Demonstrating improved performance on machine translation, text summarization, and question generation tasks with the proposed contrastive learning approach.

In summary, the paper tackles the exposure bias problem in seq2seq learning by using adversarial perturbations to generate challenging training examples for contrastive learning. This exposes the model to varied valid and invalid outputs to improve generalization.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method called CLAPS (Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Seq2Seq learning) to improve conditional text generation models like sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models. Seq2seq models are commonly trained with teacher forcing, where the ground truth token is provided at each time step. This causes exposure bias, hurting generalization. To address this, CLAPS contrasts positive input-output pairs against negative pairs using a contrastive loss. However, naive negative sampling, like using random non-target outputs, is ineffective. So CLAPS generates "hard" negative examples by adding small perturbations to the target sequence to minimize its likelihood, and "hard" positive examples by adding larger perturbations to push the example away in embedding space while maintaining high likelihood via KL divergence. This exposes the model to varied valid and invalid outputs for an input during training. Experiments on machine translation, summarization, and question generation show CLAPS significantly improves seq2seq performance by exposing it to such difficult positive/negative pairs during training. The method is model-agnostic and could extend to other seq2seq domains like speech, images, or video.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Contrastive Learning with Adversarial Perturbations for Seq2Seq (CLAPS) to mitigate the exposure bias problem in conditional text generation models like seq2seq. Exposure bias refers to how seq2seq models are usually trained only with teacher forcing, where the ground truth is provided at each time step, so they are never exposed to their own incorrectly generated tokens during training. To address this, CLAPS contrasts positive input-output pairs to negative pairs in the latent space to expose the model to both valid and invalid examples. It generates hard negative examples by adding small perturbations to the target sentence embeddings to minimize conditional likelihood. It generates hard positive examples by adding large perturbations to target embeddings to minimize similarity to the input while preserving high likelihood. Through experiments on machine translation, summarization, and question generation, the paper shows CLAPS significantly improves seq2seq performance by creating better representations that distinguish correct and incorrect outputs. The key ideas are using adversarial perturbations to craft hard negative and positive examples for contrastive learning versus random sampling, and using them to mitigate exposure bias in seq2seq text generation.
