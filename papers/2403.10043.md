# [GeoPro-VO: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance with Geometric Projector Based on   Velocity Obstacle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10043)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Optimization-based approaches are commonly used for robot motion planning to satisfy constraints like dynamics, collision avoidance, and physical limitations. However, solving these nonlinear optimization problems efficiently in real-time remains challenging. Specifically, formulating collision avoidance constraints based on velocity obstacles (VO) introduces integer variables, turning the problem into a difficult mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP).

Method:
This paper proposes a geometric projector for dynamic obstacle avoidance based on velocity obstacles (GeoPro-VO) to leverage the projection properties of VO's velocity cone representation. By combining GeoPro-VO with an augmented Lagrangian spectral projected gradient descent (ALSPG) algorithm, the MINLP can be reformulated into a sub-optimization problem with only control constraints. This allows efficient solution with spectral projected gradient (SPG) methods.

Specifically, GeoPro-VO projects unsafe velocities inside VO to the boundary based on the nearest hyperplane. If the velocity is already outside VO, it is maintained. This avoids directly formulating the VO constraints with integers. GeoPro-VO is combined with ALSPG, which uses an augmented Lagrangian penalty on constraint violations to reformulate the MINLP into an easier sub-problem. This sub-problem can be rapidly solved by SPG methods with the help of GeoPro-VO projections.

Contributions:

- Proposes GeoPro-VO to leverage projection properties of VO's velocity cone for efficient collision avoidance
- Integrates GeoPro-VO with ALSPG algorithm to reformulate constrained MINLP as real-time solvable sub-optimization 
- Eliminates need for integers to formulate VO constraints, enabling faster solution
- Validation in simulations shows efficient computation and reliable dynamic obstacle avoidance even with short MPC horizons

The key insight is to utilize geometric projectors like GeoPro-VO to avoid directly formulating difficult nonlinear constraints like VO as integers. By reformulating the problem for efficient projection, real-time performance is enabled. This allows dynamically feasible and collision-free robot motion planning.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a velocity obstacle-based geometric projector to efficiently reformulate and solve constrained nonlinear model predictive control for dynamic obstacle avoidance.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a geometric projector for dynamic obstacle avoidance based on velocity obstacle (GeoPro-VO). This leverages the projection feature of the velocity cone set represented by velocity obstacle to project unsafe velocities inside the velocity obstacle outside to achieve collision avoidance.

2) It integrates the proposed GeoPro-VO with the augmented Lagrangian spectral projected gradient descent (ALSPG) algorithm to reformulate the constrained nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem into a sub-optimization problem. This allows the problem to be solved more efficiently compared to directly solving the nominal NMPC formulation. 

3) Through numerical simulations, the paper shows that the proposed approach can efficiently solve the sub-optimization problem and improve navigation safety. The robot is able to reach its destination while avoiding collisions with both static and dynamic obstacles, even when the NMPC prediction horizon is short.

In summary, the main contribution is the proposal of GeoPro-VO and its integration with ALSPG to efficiently solve constrained robot motion planning and control problems with obstacle avoidance constraints. This improves computational efficiency and safety compared to existing approaches.
