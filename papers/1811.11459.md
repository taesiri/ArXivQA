# Coordinate-based Texture Inpainting for Pose-Guided Image Generation

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we generate realistic images of humans in novel poses based on a single input image? The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:- Proposing a new coordinate-based texture inpainting method to complete the texture of the human body surface from a partial view. This allows estimating a dense correspondence between points on the body surface and pixels in the input image.- Using the estimated dense correspondence to warp the completed texture map to the novel pose, providing alignment between input and output. - A convolutional neural network architecture with deformable skip connections guided by the correspondence map to generate the final output image in the new pose.So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by explicitly estimating the body surface texture and correspondence between input and output, they can synthesize more realistic pose transfers even with large changes in viewpoint. The coordinate-based texture inpainting and deformable skip connections are key to enabling this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is a new approach for pose-guided human image generation. The key ideas are:- Proposing a coordinate-based texture inpainting method to complete the texture of the human body surface from a partial view. Rather than inpainting the RGB values directly, the network estimates correspondence between texels and source image pixels. This allows retaining high-frequency details in the completed texture. - Using the completed body surface texture, warped to the target pose, as an input to the image generation network. The established texel-to-pixel correspondence is used to guide deformable skip connections in the network.- Showing state-of-the-art results on pose-guided image generation on DeepFashion dataset, outperforming prior works. The method is also shown to work for garment transfer and face view synthesis tasks.In summary, the main contribution is a new coordinate-based texture inpainting approach and its application to pose-guided human image generation via a pipeline involving texture warping and a refinement network with deformable skip connections. This gives improved results over prior state-of-the-art methods.
