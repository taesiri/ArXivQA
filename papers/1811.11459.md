# [Coordinate-based Texture Inpainting for Pose-Guided Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11459)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How can we generate realistic images of humans in novel poses based on a single input image? 

The key ideas and contributions of the paper are:

- Proposing a new coordinate-based texture inpainting method to complete the texture of the human body surface from a partial view. This allows estimating a dense correspondence between points on the body surface and pixels in the input image.

- Using the estimated dense correspondence to warp the completed texture map to the novel pose, providing alignment between input and output. 

- A convolutional neural network architecture with deformable skip connections guided by the correspondence map to generate the final output image in the new pose.

So in summary, the main hypothesis is that by explicitly estimating the body surface texture and correspondence between input and output, they can synthesize more realistic pose transfers even with large changes in viewpoint. The coordinate-based texture inpainting and deformable skip connections are key to enabling this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a new approach for pose-guided human image generation. The key ideas are:

- Proposing a coordinate-based texture inpainting method to complete the texture of the human body surface from a partial view. Rather than inpainting the RGB values directly, the network estimates correspondence between texels and source image pixels. This allows retaining high-frequency details in the completed texture. 

- Using the completed body surface texture, warped to the target pose, as an input to the image generation network. The established texel-to-pixel correspondence is used to guide deformable skip connections in the network.

- Showing state-of-the-art results on pose-guided image generation on DeepFashion dataset, outperforming prior works. The method is also shown to work for garment transfer and face view synthesis tasks.

In summary, the main contribution is a new coordinate-based texture inpainting approach and its application to pose-guided human image generation via a pipeline involving texture warping and a refinement network with deformable skip connections. This gives improved results over prior state-of-the-art methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new deep learning approach for pose-guided human image generation that estimates a complete body surface texture from a single image using a coordinate-based inpainting method and then warps and refines the texture into a new pose using convolutional networks.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are some key points comparing this paper to other research in pose-guided human image generation:

- The main novelty is in the coordinate-based texture inpainting approach for estimating the full human body texture from a partial view. This allows retaining finer details compared to color-based inpainting methods used in prior works like Neverova et al. 

- The overall pipeline of texture estimation followed by a refinement network is similar to some prior works like Neverova et al. and Siarohin et al. However, this paper introduces improvements like the coordinate-based inpainting and use of deformable skip connections in the refinement network.

- For pose guidance, this paper relies on DensePose like Neverova et al., while some other works use just keypoints. The results show this method performs well even with just keypoint conditioning.

- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art quantitative results on DeepFashion dataset, outperforming Neverova et al., Siarohin et al., and Esser et al. in most metrics. It also shows better qualitative results through a user study.

- It also shows the applicability of the coordinate-based inpainting idea to face resynthesis using a different dataset, demonstrating the generality of the approach.

- The method is not limited to just pose transfer but also supports garment transfer with simple modifications, showing results competitive with recent virtual try-on methods.

Overall, the main strengths of this work over prior art seem to be the coordinate-based inpainting for better texture details, deformable skip connections in the network, and strong experimental results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The ideas seem fairly generalizable as evidenced by the face resynthesis and garment transfer results.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other coordinate-based inpainting methods beyond their proposed approach to see if further improvements in texture detail and quality can be achieved. They suggest their coordinate-based inpainting is a promising direction but other techniques may push this even further.

- Applying their pipeline and coordinate-based inpainting idea to other tasks like novel view synthesis for other types of objects besides humans/faces. The texture inpainting approach could be useful for other classes of objects.

- Extending their garment transfer modification to handle more complex clothing deformation and motion, not just changes in body pose. The current method is limited in the clothing deformation it can handle.

- Combining their approach with geometric methods like 3D Morphable Models to inject more explicit geometric priors and constraints into the pipeline. This could improve robustness and consistency.

- Exploring semi-supervised or unsupervised training regimes that rely less on paired training data of source/target views. Their current method requires supervised training data.

- Validating their approach on a wider range of datasets beyond DeepFashion and faces to better understand generalization capabilities to new domains.

In summary, the main future directions seem to be around improving coordinate-based inpainting, applying the pipeline to new tasks/datasets, combining it with geometric methods, and reducing dependence on paired supervision. The core ideas show promise but there are still many avenues for development and extension of the method.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new deep learning approach for pose-guided resynthesis of human photographs. The key idea is to first estimate the complete body surface texture from a single input photo using a novel coordinate-based texture inpainting method. Rather than inpainting the RGB colors directly, the network estimates correspondence between points on the body surface and pixels in the input image. This preserves details better than RGB inpainting. The estimated texture is then warped to the target pose and passed to a final network that generates the output image. This network uses the established correspondence to guide deformable skip connections between layers. Experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for pose-guided person image generation. The method is also shown to work for garment transfer and face resynthesis tasks. Overall, the coordinate-based texture inpainting and deformable skip connections allow the approach to synthesize highly realistic novel views even under large pose changes.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents a new deep learning approach to pose-guided image synthesis of humans. The key idea is to first estimate the full body surface texture of the person from a single input image. Since the input image only shows a part of the body surface, the authors propose a new inpainting method to complete the missing areas of the body texture. This inpainting is done in a coordinate space rather than color space - the network estimates corresponding source pixels in the input image for each point on the body surface. This allows the completed texture to retain high frequency details from the input image. The completed body texture is then warped to match the target pose. Finally, a convolutional network synthesizes the output image using the warped texture, source image, and poses as input. It uses deformable skip connections guided by the estimated pixel correspondences to properly integrate information from the input image.

The method is evaluated on the DeepFashion dataset for pose-guided person image synthesis. Both automatic metrics and a user study show it outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies validate the importance of the coordinate-based texture inpainting and deformable skip connections. The approach is also demonstrated for garment transfer and face resynthesis tasks. In summary, this paper introduces a highly effective technique for coordinate-based texture inpainting that enables high quality results for pose-guided human image synthesis even with large differences between the input and output poses. The core ideas could be applicable to synthesizing other articulated objects besides humans.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents a new deep learning approach for pose-guided human image generation. The key idea is to first estimate the full body surface texture from a single input image. Since only a part of the body surface is visible in the input, they propose a coordinate-based texture inpainting method. Rather than directly inpainting the color values, the network estimates source image coordinates for each element of the body surface texture. This establishes a correspondence between input image pixels and all points on the body surface. The completed texture coordinate map is then warped to the target pose. Finally, a convolutional network uses this warped correspondence map along with the input image to generate the output image in the new pose. The coordinate-based inpainting allows the network to retain high-frequency texture details from the input image even for large pose differences. Experiments show the approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art for pose-guided human image generation. The method is also demonstrated for garment transfer and face view synthesis tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading, this paper is addressing the problem of pose-guided human image generation. Specifically, it is looking at the task of synthesizing a new view of a person from a single input image, where the new view has a different pose than the input image. 

The key challenges addressed are:

- How to generate realistic and detailed textures of the full human body surface, when only a partial view is available in the input image. They propose a new "coordinate-based texture inpainting" method to address this.

- How to effectively transfer the estimated texture to the new pose, even when the pose change is large. They establish dense correspondences between views using the estimated texture and pose mappings. 

- How to synthesize a realistic output image from the transferred texture and correspondence maps. They use a convolutional network with deformable skip connections guided by the correspondence maps.

So in summary, this paper presents a full pipeline for pose-guided human image generation, with the main novel contributions being the coordinate-based texture inpainting method and using the resulting correspondence maps to guide the image synthesis network. The overall goal is to enable realistic human image synthesis even with large changes in body pose.
