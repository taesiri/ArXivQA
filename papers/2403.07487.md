## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Motion Mamba: Efficient and Long Sequence Motion Generation with Hierarchical and Bidirectional Selective SSM":

Problem:
- Generating realistic human motion sequences, especially long sequences, is challenging for current models like autoencoders, GANs, and diffusion models. 
- Transformer-based diffusion models struggle with long-range dependencies and have inefficient inference due to quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Motion Mamba, the first motion generation model based on selective state space models (SSMs), which can capture long-range dependencies with efficient linear complexity.

- Two main components:
  - Hierarchical Temporal Mamba (HTM): Processes motion sequence data hierarchically using varied numbers of isolated SSM modules to enhance consistency across frames.
  - Bidirectional Spatial Mamba (BSM): Bidirectionally processes latent pose representations to enhance motion accuracy within each frame.

Main Contributions:  
- Pioneers integration of efficient selective SSM into motion generation through specially designed blocks:
  - HTM block with hierarchical scan preserves consistency.
  - BSM block bidirectionally captures skeleton features.
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, with up to 50% FID improvement.
- Significantly faster inference, 4x speedup compared to MLD, enabling real-time motion generation.
- Specialized design using HTM hierarchy and BSM bidirectionality advances long-range sequence modeling in motion generation.

In summary, Motion Mamba introduces an efficient selective SSM approach for accurate and fast long sequence motion generation through temporal hierarchy and spatial bidirectionality.
