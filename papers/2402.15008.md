# [Radiation Surveys in Active Nuclear Facilities with Heterogeneous   Collaborative Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15008)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Nuclear facilities need to routinely survey for radiation contamination to ensure safety of workers and infrastructure. Currently this is done manually by technicians, leaving personnel vulnerable to radiation exposure and the process is not comprehensive.

Proposed Solution: 
- Develop a heterogeneous team of mobile robots called the Robot Radiation Survey System (RRSS) to autonomously perform comprehensive radiation surveys. The team consists of:

1) Minibots: Small, expendable robots to map difficult-to-reach areas underneath furniture etc. Provides detailed 3D maps.

2) Magni: Wheeled robot with large alpha radiation sensor to efficiently survey floors and high traffic areas. Employs coverage path planning algorithms.

3) Alph: Quadruped with robotic arm to survey elevated surfaces, open doors and move obstacles. Uses affordance templates for efficient manipulation.

The robots collaborate, with Alph assisting the others by clearing obstacles. The system aims to provide automatic, regular, comprehensive surveys with no human intervention needed.

Main Contributions:

- Novel coverage path planning technique for Magni that accounts for off-center radiation sensor and full 3D environment geometry

- Method to optimize Magni's velocity during radiation detection based on desired measurement uncertainty  

- Computationally efficient affordance templates implemented on Alph's robotic arm to enable versatile autonomous manipulation

- Approach for Alph to apply precise forces for radiation swipe testing using integrated force-torque sensor 

- Use of task virtual fixtures to constrain manipulator motion during surface contamination testing

- Integration of adaptive fault-tolerant Temoto software architecture across full multi-robot system

The paper provides storyboards outlining an integrated demonstration showcasing the capabilities and collaboration of the multi-robot system to complete autonomous surveys. Remaining challenges around high-level planning and cybersecurity are discussed.
