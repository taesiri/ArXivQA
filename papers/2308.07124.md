# [OctoPack: Instruction Tuning Code Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07124)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question seems to be: 

How effective is instruction tuning using code commits for improving the performance and generalization ability of large language models on diverse code tasks across multiple programming languages?

More specifically, the key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Instruction tuning code models on a large and diverse dataset of code commits can significantly improve their performance on code tasks like repair, explanation, and synthesis compared to just pretraining on code. 

2) Instruction tuning enables code models to generalize better to new programming languages not seen during tuning by teaching them to follow instructions.

3) The proposed commit dataset CommitPack provides a useful source of instructional data for training code models, compared to alternatives like Self-Instruct data or the OASST dialog dataset.

4) The proposed evaluation benchmark HumanEvalPack, spanning 3 code tasks over 6 languages, provides a more comprehensive test of generalization than existing benchmarks focused only on code synthesis.

5) The proposed models OctoCoder and OctoGeeX achieve state-of-the-art performance among openly licensed models on this new benchmark, demonstrating the benefits of instruction tuning on commits.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that instruction tuning on commits generalizes better across diverse code tasks and languages compared to just pretraining, which the paper aims to validate through the proposed data, models, and benchmark.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is the creation and evaluation of OctoPack, which consists of:

- CommitPack: A large-scale dataset of 4TB of Git commits across 350 programming languages for pretraining and instruction tuning code models. 

- CommitPackFT: A filtered 2GB subset of CommitPack focused on high-quality code instructions.

- HumanEvalPack: An expanded code benchmark covering code synthesis, code repair, and code explanation across 6 programming languages.

- OctoCoder: An instruction tuned Code LLM created by finetuning StarCoder on CommitPackFT that achieves state-of-the-art performance among publicly available models on HumanEvalPack.

- OctoGeeX: An instruction tuned variant of CodeGeeX2 using the same method.

In summary, the paper introduces new code instruction data, benchmarks, and models to advance instruction tuning of Code LLMs. The key innovation is creating CommitPack/CommitPackFT from Git commit history and showing it leads to improved performance on coding tasks compared to other instruction data.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper introduces OctoPack, a new dataset and benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models to follow natural language instructions for coding tasks. The key contributions are a large dataset of GitHub commits for pretraining, a multi-task benchmark spanning code repair, explanation and synthesis across 6 languages, and two new state-of-the-art commercially usable code models.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other related work in the field of training and evaluating large language models on coding tasks:

- Datasets: This paper introduces CommitPack, a new large-scale dataset of commit messages and associated code changes scraped from open source GitHub repositories. This is one of the largest commit message datasets collected so far. Other related work has used smaller datasets like CodeSearchNet or mined commit messages from internal code bases.

- Tasks: The paper evaluates models on a new benchmark called HumanEvalPack that expands the existing HumanEval benchmark to additional tasks like code repair and code explanation across multiple programming languages. Most prior work focused only on code synthesis, often just for Python.

- Models: The paper benchmarks OctoCoder, a commercially licensed model created by instruction tuning StarCoder. Many recent models rely on synthetically generated training data or closed-source model APIs that may have limitations for commercial use. 

- Instruction tuning: A key contribution is showing the benefits of instruction tuning with commit message data for code tasks. Prior instruction tuning work focused on natural language. Concurrent work has also proposed instruction tuned code models.

- Analysis: The paper provides an extensive analysis and ablation studies to understand the impact of different training datasets, task formats, and model sizes. This helps gain insights compared to just reporting aggregate benchmark scores.

In summary, the paper pushes forward multiple aspects of training and evaluating large language models for coding - data, tasks, models, training techniques, and analysis. The introduced dataset, benchmark, and OctoCoder model appear to be strong open resources for further research progress in this space.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Model Execution: Letting models execute code to discover failing tests and iterate until passing could improve performance on code repair tasks like HumanEvalFix.

- Multi-File Changes: Allowing models to modify multiple files given an instruction could better reflect real-world programming. This requires handling long contexts. 

- Length-Awareness: Models struggle to limit output length. Future work could investigate improving awareness of generated output length.

- Better Evaluation: Prompting differences can affect results, so canonical prompts would help. Executing code matches models and test environment versions. Human judgment provides a more comprehensive measure than just execution.

- Reward Models: Train models to predict which code humans prefer using the pre/post commit data. Use this as a reward signal for generating human-preferred code.

- Better Instruction Data: Careful human filtering of instructions to create high-quality data could further boost performance.

- Unified Pretraining and Tuning: Better unify pretraining objectives with downstream instruction tuning.

- Multitask Models: Train models that can both follow instructions but also generate free-form code without instructions.

- Model Scale: Scale up models with more parameters and data to improve performance.

In summary, key directions are improving instruction data quality, training techniques, evaluation, incorporating human preferences, model scale, and multitask capabilities. Executing code and using multiple files during training are also important future directions.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces OctoPack, a new benchmark for evaluating the ability of large language models to follow instructions and solve coding problems across different programming languages and tasks. The authors compile CommitPack, a dataset of over 4TB of GitHub commits covering 350 languages, and use it to train instruction-following models. They also introduce HumanEvalPack, which expands the existing HumanEval benchmark to additional languages and tasks like code repair and code explanation. Their best model, OctoCoder, achieves state-of-the-art performance among openly licensed models by finetuning StarCoder on CommitPack and the OASST dataset. However, closed-source models like GPT-4 still perform better, especially on pure code synthesis tasks, suggesting that existing benchmarks may need to be made more challenging. Overall, the paper demonstrates the benefits of instruction tuning and multitask training for improving language models' versatility on coding problems.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

Paragraph 1: This paper introduces Octopack, a new dataset and benchmark for evaluating instruction-following capabilities of code generation models. The authors compile CommitPack, a dataset of 4 terabytes of Github commits covering 350 programming languages. They use this to create CommitPackFT, a filtered 2GB subset with high-quality instructions. They also construct HumanEvalPack which expands the code synthesis benchmark HumanEval to additional tasks like code repair and code explanation across 6 languages. The authors instruction tune models like StarCoder on CommitPackFT and evaluate on HumanEvalPack. Their best model OctoCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance among openly licensed models, but is outperformed by the proprietary GPT-4. 

Paragraph 2: The authors analyze the performance of various models on HumanEvalPack. They find that instruction tuning with CommitPackFT data is critical for models to succeed at the code repair task. The natural language data in CommitPackFT also helps models switch between generating code and text explanations. They show that instruction tuning transfers to unseen programming languages used during pretraining. The code synthesis subset of HumanEvalPack is nearly saturated by GPT-4, suggesting the benchmark may need expansion to remain useful. Limitations include improving awareness of output length and execution environments. The paper contributes new datasets, benchmarks, and analysis to advance instruction-tuned code generation.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper presents OctoPack, a large-scale instruction tuned code model derived from a new dataset called CommitPack. The authors introduce CommitPack, a 4TB dataset of GitHub commit messages and associated code changes across 350 programming languages. They filter this dataset down to CommitPackFT, a 2GB subset containing high quality commit messages resembling instructions. They use CommitPackFT alongside existing instruction datasets like OASST to fine-tune the pretrained 16B parameter StarCoder model. This results in their best model OctoCoder. They also expand the code synthesis benchmark HumanEval to evaluate code repair, code explanation, and code synthesis across 6 programming languages, creating HumanEvalPack. They show OctoCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance among openly licensed models on HumanEvalPack, demonstrating the effectiveness of instruction tuning on CommitPackFT. The method combines a new large scale dataset based on commits, careful filtering and mixing with existing instruction data, and evaluation on a more comprehensive benchmark covering multiple coding tasks and languages.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my reading, the key points of the paper are:

- The paper proposes a new approach for improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on coding tasks by using instruction tuning. 

- The main problem it aims to address is how to improve the usability and general performance of LLMs on a diverse range of coding-related tasks, beyond just code generation.

- The authors create a new large-scale dataset called CommitPack containing 4TB of GitHub commit data across 350 programming languages. They use this to instruction tune Code LLMs.

- The paper introduces HumanEvalPack, which expands the existing HumanEval benchmark for code synthesis to also include tasks for code repair and code explanation across 6 programming languages. 

- The authors use CommitPack and other data to instruction tune the Code LLM StarCoder, creating a new model called OctoCoder which achieves state-of-the-art results among permissive models on HumanEvalPack.

- The results demonstrate the benefits of the instruction tuning approach and CommitPack data for improving performance on a diverse set of coding tasks and languages, beyond just code generation that existing benchmarks focus on.

In summary, the key focus is on using instruction tuning and new data to make Code LLMs more capable at following natural language instructions for a variety of coding tasks, not just code synthesis. The paper shows this approach leads to improved performance across a range of tasks and languages.
