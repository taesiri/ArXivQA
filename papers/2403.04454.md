# [Low-Resource Court Judgment Summarization for Common Law Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04454)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Common law court judgments rely on precedents across jurisdictions. Generating high-quality summaries of judgments can help legal practitioners efficiently review cases. 
- However, there is a lack of multi-jurisdictional judgment summarization datasets and methods, especially for low data and computing resource settings.

Solution:
- Build the first large-scale dataset (CLSum) for summarizing common law judgments from multiple jurisdictions (Canada, Australia, UK, Hong Kong).
- Employ large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation, summary generation and evaluation to mitigate low data impact. Propose knowledge-constrained LLM rephrasing to constrain use of legal concepts when synthesizing augmented text.  
- Design a 2-stage summarization framework - first compress long inputs via content selection, then feed compressed inputs to abstractive summarization models. Use sparse attention and memory-efficient training to improve efficiency.
- Propose LTScore, an LLM-based evaluation metric that emphasizes precise use of legal terms in summaries.

Contributions:  
- CLSum dataset covering multi-jurisdictional common law judgment summarization
- First legal summarization work using LLMs for data augmentation, generation and evaluation  
- Proposed knowledge-constrained LLM rephrasing and legal term-focused LTScore metric
- Methods to address low data and computing resource challenges in judgment summarization

Overall, the paper introduces an important new legal summarization dataset, and innovative techniques leveraging LLMs to address key challenges around insufficient data and computing resources for generating judgment summaries efficiently while retaining legal precision.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents CLSum, the first large-scale dataset for summarizing common law court judgments from multiple jurisdictions, and proposes an LLM-based solution incorporating legal knowledge into data augmentation, summary generation, and a new evaluation metric to address the challenges of insufficient data and computing resources.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work are threefold:

1. They present CLSum, the first large-scale dataset for summarizing common law court judgment documents from multiple jurisdictions. 

2. They are the first to employ large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation, summary generation, and evaluation in court judgment summarization. Specifically, they design an LLM-based data augmentation method named knowledge-constrained rephrasing that introduces legal knowledge into the prompts to constrain the synthesized text. They also propose a legal knowledge enhanced evaluation metric called LTScore to assess generated legal text.

3. They design a legal knowledge enhanced evaluation metric named LTScore to evaluate generated legal text by assigning greater weights to legal terms in judgment summaries.
