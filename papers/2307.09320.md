# [Biomaker CA: a Biome Maker project using Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09320)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key research questions and hypotheses appear to be:

- How can morphogenesis and cellular automata be used to create virtual environments capable of open-ended evolution and increasing complexity of artificial lifeforms?

- Can focusing on plant-like lifeforms that require complex metabolism and reproduction lead to more evolvable and complexifying systems compared to other approaches?

- What are the most effective agent logics (architectures) and mutator strategies for driving open-ended evolution and complexification in these virtual ALife environments?

- Can meta-evolution strategies be used to evolve initial conditions (seeds) that lead to more robust and complex biomes in the simulated environments?

- How can human input be incorporated through interactive evolution to help guide the system toward interesting behaviors and lifeforms?

The overall hypothesis seems to be that incorporating morphogenesis as a core requirement, designing environments requiring complex lifecycles and metabolism, and evolving the agent logics/mutators can enable open-ended evolution leading to increasing complexity and lifelike behaviors. The experiments explore different configurations, evolution strategies, and human interaction approaches aimed at testing this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces Biomaker CA, a framework for studying artificial life, complexification, open-endedness, and ecology using cellular automata agents that undergo morphogenesis. The key contributions are:

- Biomaker CA allows for the design of different environments with customizable laws of physics where plant-like agents compete and evolve. Agents grow from seeds and must harvest scarce nutrients to survive.

- Agents are implemented with neural cellular automata, allowing complex morphogenesis. Their behaviors are defined by vectorized functions in JAX that get processed in parallel on GPU/TPU.

- The framework supports different mutation strategies to enable in-environment evolution and meta-evolution.

- Example configurations show emergent ecologies and how agents can be evolved to survive challenging environments. Interactive evolution is also demonstrated. 

- Biomaker CA enables research into open-endedness, evolvability, developmental encodings, and ecology through its flexible and performant platform for simulating artificial life.

In summary, the main contribution is providing an open-source toolkit for artificial life research that combines complex morphogenesis, in-environment evolution, and customizable physics to study the growth of complexity and open-endedness. The examples showcase the capabilities and potential research directions enabled by Biomaker CA.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in artificial life, complexification, and ecology simulation:

- The use of cellular automata as the basis for the simulated environment is a common approach in artificial life research. This builds on a long history of using CAs to study emergent behaviors and self-replication. However, the specific framework of Biomaker CA seems quite flexible and extensible compared to many previous CA-based ALife systems.

- The focus on open-ended evolution, complexification, and ecologies of interacting agents places this work squarely in the subfield of artificial life aimed at modeling open-ended Darwinian evolution. Similar goals have motivated other ALife systems like Tierra, Avida, and Geb. However, Biomaker CA's emphasis on complex morphogenesis as a requirement for agents sets it apart.

- Allowing user-defined environments, agent behaviors, and mutators makes Biomaker CA more of a flexible framework than a specific model like Avida or Tierra. This could enable studying a wider range of research questions, at the cost of not having one standardized model as a benchmark.

- The use of deep learning and differentiable programming (via JAX) is novel compared to most past ALife systems, which have typically relied on hand-coded behaviors and evolutionary algorithms. This could enable taking advantage of recent ML advances.

- Biomaker CA simulations sound computationally intensive compared to many past ALife models. Leveraging GPU parallelization helps scale it, but could limit accessibility compared to simpler models.

- The interactive evolution experiments connect this work to past systems like Picbreeder that involved humans collaboratively guiding open-ended evolution. However, doing this with complex simulated organisms rather than images is new.

Overall, Biomaker CA builds on a long history of ALife research while leveraging modern ML tools. The flexibility of the system is a strength but also means it may lack the theoretical clarity of more simplified models. However, it could serve as an extensible platform for addressing open questions in open-ended evolution.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several promising future research directions with Biomaker CA:

- Exploring different laws of physics/environments to find ones at the "edge of chaos" that enable interesting interactions and complexification. 

- Adding new materials and agent operations and studying their effects.

- Determining optimal agent architectures and building blocks for morphogenesis. 

- Finding mutator and agent logic pairs that enable rapid evolution into complexity.

- Trying sexual reproduction instead of asexual. 

- Designing agents where key properties remain invariant during evolution.

- Developing recursively fertile agents without full environment simulation. 

- Incorporating more human interaction at key points to guide evolution.

- Understanding real world ecology through simulated Biomaker CA biomes.

- Discovering reusable configurations, architectures and strategies so the community can build complexity across projects.

They also acknowledge limitations like the lack of agent mobility in CA grids and discrete space/time. The authors suggest future frameworks could address this but solving key questions in Biomaker CA first may be more prudent. Overall, they aim to provide a platform for open-ended research into artificial life, complexification, evolvability and ecology.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces Biomaker CA, a framework for simulating artificial life and studying complexification, open-endedness, evolvability, and ecology. Biomaker CA consists of cellular automata environments where plant-like agents grow from seeds, compete for scarce resources, reproduce, and evolve over time. The environments are customizable "falling sand" games with different materials, rules of physics, agent behaviors, etc. Agents have complex morphogenesis capabilities and must balance harvesting air and earth nutrients to survive. 

The paper demonstrates Biomaker CA with several example environments and experiments. Different agent logics and mutators are evaluated based on their survival rates. More complex agents are evolved through meta-evolution and interactive evolution to improve their viability. Various research questions are highlighted, such as finding the optimal agent architectures, mutation strategies, human involvement, and biome stability. Limitations are the discrete grid structure and lack of agent mobility. Overall, Biomaker CA enables many explorations in artificial life, though some complex behaviors may require more advanced frameworks in the future.
