# [Foreground-aware Image Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05945)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-quality image inpainting when the holes/masked regions overlap with or touch foreground objects. The key hypothesis is that explicitly disentangling structure inference (i.e., foreground contour completion) from content completion will lead to better inpainting results in these challenging scenarios.

Specifically, the paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting system that first predicts the foreground contours/boundaries within the masked regions, and then uses these completed contours as guidance to fill in the image content. The main hypothesis is that by separating out foreground contour completion from the actual image completion, the model can better understand and generate reasonable foreground structures compared to end-to-end approaches that try to hallucinate both simultaneously. The experiments aim to validate whether this proposed disentanglement and foreground-aware approach leads to higher quality inpainting, especially for holes near foreground objects.

In summary, the key research question is whether explicit foreground contour completion and guidance improves image inpainting quality over existing end-to-end approaches when holes overlap foreground objects. The paper proposes and evaluates a system to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a foreground-aware image inpainting system that explicitly disentangles structure inference and content completion. Specifically:

- They propose to first predict the foreground contour in the image, and then use the predicted contour as guidance to inpaint the missing region. 

- They introduce a contour completion module to predict reasonable contours of objects. This module takes the incomplete image, incomplete contour, and hole mask as input, and outputs a completed contour.

- They use the completed contour along with the incomplete image as input to the image completion module to generate the final inpainted result.

- They collect a dataset of over 15,000 images with salient object segmentation masks to train the contour completion and image completion modules.

- They show that by disentangling structure inference and image completion, the contour completion model can predict better contours, and the image completion model can generate higher-quality and more realistic inpainting results, especially for challenging cases where holes overlap with foreground objects.

In summary, the key contribution is proposing to incorporate explicit foreground object knowledge through contour prediction and completion to guide image inpainting, which substantially improves performance compared to existing inpainting methods.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting system that first predicts the foreground contour, completes the contour in the masked region, and then uses the completed contour as guidance to fill in the missing image content, in order to address limitations of existing inpainting methods in handling holes overlapping foreground objects.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper on foreground-aware image inpainting compares to other research in the field:

- The main contribution of this paper is the idea of disentangling structure inference and image completion for inpainting. Specifically, the method first predicts the foreground contours/structures in the missing region before inpainting the image content. Most prior work on learning-based inpainting does not explicitly model foreground/background structures.

- This explicit modeling of contours allows the method to handle challenging cases where the holes overlap with foreground objects better than prior arts. As shown in the experiments, it generates cleaner results along object boundaries.

- The general idea of using predicted structures to guide image synthesis has been explored before in other contexts like image-to-image translation. But this paper is one of the first to adopt this idea for image inpainting.

- The proposed model is simple yet effective. It consists of separate modules for contour completion and image completion. The contour completion module uses a convolutional encoder-decoder with adversarial training. Nothing too fancy.

- For training data, the paper uses saliency segmentation datasets instead of typical inpainting datasets like Places. This allows collecting training data with ground truth foreground masks and contours.

- The experiments compare the method fairly extensively to prior arts like PartialConv, GatedConv, ContextAttention, etc. Both quantitative metrics and user studies show improved results.

In summary, the key novelty is the intuitive idea of explicit contour modeling and using it to guide inpainting. The simplicity of the approach while still improving over state-of-the-art demonstrates its effectiveness. The results look cleaner and more realistic. The idea could potentially be applied to other synthesis tasks as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Exploring other ways to incorporate foreground/background knowledge into image inpainting besides contours, such as semantic segmentation maps or masks. The authors mention that explicitly modeling foreground and background layers during training could be beneficial.

- Applying the idea of disentangling structure inference and image completion to other image generation tasks beyond inpainting, such as image super-resolution, enhancement, etc. The general idea of using an explicit structure prediction model to guide image generation could be relevant for other tasks.

- Improving the contour completion model to handle more complex cases with multiple overlapping objects. The current model focuses on images with a single salient object.

- Collecting larger datasets tailored for foreground-aware image inpainting to train more robust models. The authors rely on saliency datasets which are still limited in diversity compared to natural image datasets. 

- Exploring unconditional image generation along with foreground-background disentanglement, i.e. generating both the structural content and appearance from scratch. The current model relies on an input image to start with.

- Validating the approach on real-world object removal applications to quantify performance on practical use cases. The experiments are mainly focused on synthetic datasets currently.

In summary, the key directions are extending the disentanglement idea to other tasks, improving the contour prediction model, collecting more diverse datasets, and evaluating on real-world applications. The core idea of disentangling structure and appearance seems very promising according to the results.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting system that explicitly disentangles structure inference and content completion. The model first predicts the foreground contour, then completes the missing region using the predicted contour as guidance. Specifically, the model detects an incomplete foreground contour from the corrupted image. A contour completion module then predicts the missing parts of the contour. This completed contour, along with the input image, is fed into an image completion module to fill in the holes. The contour completion module is trained on a collected dataset of salient object images with segmentation masks. The image completion module is first pretrained on Places2, then finetuned on the salient object dataset using the predicted contours as guidance. Experiments show the model significantly outperforms existing methods, especially on challenging cases where holes overlap with foreground objects. The explicit contour prediction provides reasonable structure guidance for image completion in such cases.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting system that explicitly disentangles structure inference and content completion. The key idea is to first predict the foreground contour, and then use that to guide image inpainting. Specifically, the model first detects the foreground contour of the corrupted image. A contour completion module is then used to predict the missing parts of the contour inside the holes. The completed contour provides guidance for the image completion module to inpaint the missing region. By disentangling structure inference and content completion in this way, the contour completion model is able to predict reasonable object contours. This substantially improves the performance of image inpainting, especially for challenging cases where holes overlap with or touch foreground objects. 

The model is trained on a dataset of images with salient objects and corresponding segmentation masks. Holes are generated to simulate real removal of distracting objects. The contour completion and image completion modules are trained with both content losses to match the ground truth and adversarial losses for realistic results. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with both quantitative metrics and user studies showing the advantage of explicit contour guidance. The approach addresses limitations of existing inpainting methods that lack understanding of foreground/background structure. Overall, the paper presents a novel framework to incorporate semantic knowledge through foreground contour prediction for high-quality image inpainting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting system that disentangles structure inference and content completion. The model first detects the foreground contour of the corrupted image. A contour completion module then predicts the missing parts of the contour. The completed contour guidance is then fed along with the corrupted image to the image completion module to predict the final inpainted image. By first completing the contour, the model gains knowledge of the foreground structure which helps guide the image completion module to fill in the holes with realistic content. The contour completion and image completion modules are trained sequentially, first pretraining on Places2 and then fine-tuning on a saliency dataset with ground truth contours. A curriculum learning strategy is used to stabilize the adversarial training of the modules. Experiments demonstrate the model's ability to complete challenging holes overlapping foreground objects and outperforms previous methods quantitatively and qualitatively.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my understanding, this paper is addressing the problem of image inpainting in challenging cases where the holes or missing regions overlap with or are close to foreground objects. The key points are:

- Conventional image inpainting methods often fail when the holes overlap with foreground objects, as they lack understanding of the foreground/background structure and extent of objects within the holes.

- Existing learning-based methods treat inpainting as implicit image generation without explicitly modeling foreground/background layers. They are trained on random hole masks that are often completely in background or foreground, inconsistent with real cases.

- This paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting method that disentangles structure inference and image completion. It first predicts the foreground contour, completes the contour, and uses that to guide image completion.

- The model is trained on a collected dataset of images with salient objects and segmentation masks. Holes are generated specifically with potential overlap with foreground objects.

- Experiments show the model generates more realistic inpainting, especially around object borders, compared to previous methods. The explicit contour guidance is shown to be crucial.

In summary, the key idea is to incorporate explicit foreground object understanding to handle challenging inpainting cases involving holes near objects. This is done by disentangling structure prediction and image completion and using predicted contours to guide image inpainting.
