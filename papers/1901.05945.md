# Foreground-aware Image Inpainting

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is how to perform high-quality image inpainting when the holes/masked regions overlap with or touch foreground objects. The key hypothesis is that explicitly disentangling structure inference (i.e., foreground contour completion) from content completion will lead to better inpainting results in these challenging scenarios.Specifically, the paper proposes a foreground-aware image inpainting system that first predicts the foreground contours/boundaries within the masked regions, and then uses these completed contours as guidance to fill in the image content. The main hypothesis is that by separating out foreground contour completion from the actual image completion, the model can better understand and generate reasonable foreground structures compared to end-to-end approaches that try to hallucinate both simultaneously. The experiments aim to validate whether this proposed disentanglement and foreground-aware approach leads to higher quality inpainting, especially for holes near foreground objects.In summary, the key research question is whether explicit foreground contour completion and guidance improves image inpainting quality over existing end-to-end approaches when holes overlap foreground objects. The paper proposes and evaluates a system to test this hypothesis.
