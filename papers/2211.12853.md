# [BAD-NeRF: Bundle Adjusted Deblur Neural Radiance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12853)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question addressed in this paper is how to train neural radiance fields (NeRF) on motion blurred images to jointly reconstruct the 3D scene and recover the camera motion trajectories within exposure time. The key ideas and contributions are:- Proposes a bundle adjustment formulation to jointly optimize NeRF and camera motion trajectories given motion blurred images. - Models the physical image formation process of motion blur by rendering and averaging sharp frames along the trajectory.- Achieves state-of-the-art performance in deblurring, novel view synthesis, and pose estimation on synthetic and real datasets. The main hypothesis is that by explicitly modeling the image formation process of motion blur and bundle adjusting both scene geometry and camera motion, they can overcome the limitations of training NeRFs on blurry images with inaccurate poses. The experiments validate this hypothesis and show quantitative improvements over prior work.In summary, this paper addresses the problem of training high-quality NeRFs from degraded inputs by jointly optimizing the neural representation and camera trajectories in a physically based manner. The novel bundle adjustment framework is the main contribution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper proposes a method called BAD-NeRF (Bundle Adjusted Deblur Neural Radiance Fields) for training NeRF using motion blurry images and inaccurate camera poses. The main contributions are:- They propose a photometric bundle adjustment formulation for motion blurry images using NeRF. This jointly optimizes the NeRF network parameters and camera motion trajectories within exposure time to match the real motion blurry images. - They model the camera motion trajectory within exposure time with start and end poses, and linearly interpolate intermediate poses in SE(3) space. This allows jointly optimizing the poses together with NeRF using the differentiable rendering process.- Experiments show the proposed method can effectively deblur images, render high quality novel views, and accurately recover camera poses from blurry images. It outperforms prior image deblurring and novel view synthesis methods.In summary, the key contribution is proposing a joint optimization framework to simultaneously deblur images, reconstruct 3D scene, and refine camera poses by incorporating the image formation model of motion blur into NeRF. This makes NeRF more robust to blurry inputs for novel view synthesis.
