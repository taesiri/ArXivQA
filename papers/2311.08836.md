# [Evaluating Gender Bias in the Translation of Gender-Neutral Languages   into English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08836)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Machine translation (MT) models often introduce gender bias when translating from gender-neutral languages (e.g. Turkish) to more gendered languages (e.g. English). For example, translating a gender-neutral Turkish word to "she" in English.  
- There are no good benchmarks to evaluate this translation gender bias and test mitigation strategies.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduced GATE X-E, an extension to the GATE corpus, consisting of 1250-1850 natural sentences translated from Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish and Persian into English.
- Each sentence is accompanied by feminine, masculine and neutral translation variants to cover possible gender interpretations. 
- Sentences have diverse lengths and domains, challenging translation rewriting systems.

- Also presented an English gender rewriting system built on GPT-3.5 Turbo and evaluated it on a subset of GATE X-E's pronoun-only uniform-gender problems:
   - First generates all-neutral translation with GPT-3.5 Turbo 
   - Then uses rules to convert neutral translation to feminine and masculine variants

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive gender bias evaluation benchmark (GATE X-E) for translations into English 
- Covers range of linguistic phenomena with natural sentences
- Analysis of intricacies in English translation gender rewriting problems
- High accuracy English rewriting algorithm using GPT-3.5 Turbo for a subset of the problems
- Open-sourced dataset and algorithm to encourage more research

The paper makes good contributions in introducing a much-needed diverse evaluation benchmark for English translation gender bias, presenting analysis of associated linguistic challenges, and demonstrating high rewrite accuracy with GPT-3.5 Turbo on a subset of the problems.
