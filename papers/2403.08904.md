# [Detecting Hallucination and Coverage Errors in Retrieval Augmented   Generation for Controversial Topics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08904)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Large language models (LLMs) are being used in chatbots, but they can struggle with generating factual, unbiased responses on controversial topics. Completely avoiding or just giving canned responses to such topics has downsides. 
- The paper explores an alternative approach - acknowledging the lack of consensus and surfacing multiple perspectives on controversial topics, inspired by Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) principle.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce the NPOV Response Task: Given a query and retrieved pro/con perspectives with arguments, generate a response introducing the query and verbalizing the perspectives.
- Use a large conversational LLM adapted via prompt tuning for this task. 
- Focus on detecting two common errors: hallucinations (generating unsupported arguments) and coverage errors (dropping given arguments).

Methods:
- Propose data-free methods using word overlap (ROUGE) and salience maps to detect errors.
- Also train LLM classifiers on small labeled datasets to detect errors. Classifiers are trained on both organic and synthetic errors.  

Key Results:
- LLM classifiers achieve very strong performance (ROC AUC 95% for hallucinations, 91% for coverage errors) even when trained only on synthetic errors.
- Data-free methods also achieve reasonably strong results. ROUGE works best when paraphrasing is limited. Salience maps better capture semantics.
- Demonstrate the value of different test sets - synthetically constructed sets help isolate strengths/weaknesses.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of NPOV response task for controversial topics 
- Methods for hallucination & coverage error detection in this setup
- Analysis showing pre-trained LLM classifiers detect errors remarkably well even with minimal labeled data
- Insights on data-free techniques for error detection in retrieval augmented generation

The paper discusses limitations around bias detection and generalizability, as well as computational costs. It suggests guardrails may be needed before deploying such models.
