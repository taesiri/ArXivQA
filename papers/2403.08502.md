# [Masked Generative Story Transformer with Character Guidance and Caption   Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08502)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
The paper addresses the task of story visualization (SV) - generating a sequence of images that visualize a narrative text. SV is challenging as it requires: 1) High visual quality of generated images 2) Consistency of objects like characters across the image sequence 3) Semantic alignment between images and corresponding captions. Prior works using GANs or Transformers have limitations in efficiently achieving these.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MaskGST - a parallel transformer architecture based on MaskGIT that is enhanced with:
1) Cross-Attention layers to enable captions from the full story sequence to provide context when generating each image. This improves consistency.
2) A character guidance technique to steer image generation towards depicting characters referenced in captions by combining text-conditional, positive character-conditional and negative character-conditional logits.
3) Use of an LLM to augment training captions and improve model robustness.

Main Contributions:  
1) First adoption of MaskGIT paradigm for story visualization 
2) Simple yet effective character guidance method to significantly improve character generation
3) Image-agnostic LLM-based caption augmentation that enhances model robustness
4) State-of-the-art results on Pororo-SV benchmark across metrics like FID, Char-F1, Char-Acc and BLEU while using far lesser compute than prior arts
5) Significantly more efficient in terms of computational complexity than prior Transformer models

In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of MaskGIT-style transformers for story visualization via an enhanced design and training strategy that efficiently achieves new state-of-the-art results using limited resources.
