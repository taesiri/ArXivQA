# [Benchmarking the Robustness of UAV Tracking Against Common Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11424)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- UAV tracking is important for surveillance, robotics etc. but current methods focus on performance under normal conditions and neglect robustness against corruptions (e.g. weather, sensor noise) that can occur in real-world drone videos.  
- Lack of dedicated benchmarks to evaluate UAV tracking robustness against corruptions.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce UAV-C, a large-scale benchmark for assessing UAV tracker robustness against common corruptions. 
- Built on two popular UAV tracking datasets UAV123 and DTB70.
- Introduces 18 types of synthesized corruptions in 4 groups (weather, sensor, blur, composite), each with 3 severity levels.
- In total 10k+ sequences with 3.1 million frames.

- Evaluate 12 representative UAV trackers from diverse architectures to benchmark performance and provide baselines.

Key Findings:
- All trackers show degraded performance in presence of corruptions. Up to 72.9% drop in precision.  
- Composite corruptions result in more severe performance drops.
- Different trackers are sensitive to different corruptions.
- Zoom blur corruption causes biggest tracking performance drop on average.
- OSTrack using pure Transformer architecture shows most robustness.

Main Contributions:
- First large-scale benchmark (UAV-C) dedicated to assessing UAV tracking robustness against corruptions
- Extensive benchmarking of 12 trackers to understand current performance
- In-depth analysis providing insights and guidance for developing more robust UAV trackers
