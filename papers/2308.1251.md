# [A Hyper-pixel-wise Contrastive Learning Augmented Segmentation Network   for Old Landslide Detection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images and   Digital Elevation Model Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.1251)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to reliably detect old landslides in remote sensing images, which is challenging due to the visual blurriness and limited data. The main hypothesis is that fusing features from heterogeneous data modalities (optical images and DEM) along with a novel contrastive learning approach can improve old landslide detection performance.Specifically, the paper proposes a model called HPCL-Net that:1) Extracts and fuses optical features from HRSI and terrain features from DEM using a heterogeneous feature extractor with coordinate attention. 2) Uses a supervised hyperpixel-wise contrastive learning method to enhance feature learning, constructing sample pairs from landslide boundary areas. 3) Implements a global contrastive queue to provide diverse samples for contrastive learning.The experiments aim to evaluate whether this approach can reliably detect visually indistinct old landslides compared to previous methods. The results show improved performance, supporting the hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to improve old landslide detection using multi-modal fusion and contrastive learning in a model called HPCL-Net. The experiments provide evidence that this approach is effective.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. Proposing a hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning augmented segmentation network (HPCL-Net) for old landslide detection using high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) and digital elevation model (DEM) data. 2. Designing a heterogeneous feature extractor with a dual-branch network and coordinate attention (CA) mechanism to extract and fuse optical features from HRSIs and terrain features from DEM data.3. Developing a supervised hyper-pixel-wise contrastive learning method, including contrastive sample pairs constructor (CSPC) and global contrastive queues constructor (GCQC), to enhance feature learning from limited data.4. Conducting extensive experiments on a real Loess Plateau old landslide dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of HPCL-Net. The results show significant improvements in detection reliability compared to previous methods.In summary, the main contribution is developing the HPCL-Net model to reliably detect visually indistinct old landslides by fusing heterogeneous remote sensing data and utilizing supervised contrastive learning to alleviate the small-sized dataset problem. The proposed methods for feature extraction, fusion and contrastive learning are demonstrated to be effective through experiments.
