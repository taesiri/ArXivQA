# [Spherical Frustum Sparse Convolution Network for LiDAR Point Cloud   Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17491)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Spherical Frustum sparse Convolutional Network (SFCNet) for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation that eliminates the quantized information loss suffered by previous projection-based methods. The key innovation is the spherical frustum structure, which preserves all points projected to the same 2D location instead of dropping redundant points. To enable convolution on the irregular frustums, the paper presents a hash-based representation along with a Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution (SFC) method. Furthermore, a Frustum Farthest Point Sampling is introduced for uniform 3D sampling. Experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate SFCNetâ€™s superior performance over previous projection-based methods, especially on small objects, owing to preserving complete geometric structure. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SFC and sampling techniques. Overall, this work makes significant progress towards accurate and efficient projection-based point cloud segmentation without information loss.

## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a novel spherical frustum structure with a memory-efficient hash-based representation to avoid quantized information loss during projection and preserve complete geometric structure.

2. Integrating the spherical frustum structure into 2D sparse convolution, and proposing a Spherical Frustum sparse Convolution Network (SFCNet) for LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation without quantized information loss. 

3. Proposing an efficient and uniform 3D point cloud sampling method called Frustum Farthest Point Sampling (F2PS) based on sampling spherical frustums by stride and points inside each frustum by Farthest Point Sampling.
