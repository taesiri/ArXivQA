# [Towards Robust Model Watermark via Reducing Parametric Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04777)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is: how to make backdoor-based watermarks more robust against watermark removal attacks?Specifically, the authors investigate the vulnerability of existing backdoor-based watermarking methods, where they find there exist many watermark-removed models in the vicinity of the original watermarked model. This makes it easy for removal attacks like fine-tuning to erase the watermark behaviors. To address this vulnerability, the authors propose a minimax formulation to find and recover these watermark-removed models during training. They also observe and mitigate the domain shift between defenses and attacks when using BatchNorm. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate their method can consistently improve the robustness of backdoor-based watermarks against several state-of-the-art removal attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:- It demonstrates that there exist many watermark-removed models in the vicinity of the watermarked model in the parameter space, which may be easily utilized by fine-tuning and other removal methods. - It proposes a minimax formulation to find watermark-removed models in the vicinity and recover their watermark behaviors, to mitigate the vulnerability in the parameter space. This is shown to effectively improve the watermarking robustness against removal attacks.- It conducts extensive experiments against several state-of-the-art watermark-remove attacks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. - It also conducts some exploratory experiments to have a closer look at the proposed method.In summary, the key contribution is the minimax formulation that finds and repairs vulnerable watermark-removed models nearby the original watermarked model, resulting in a more robust watermarking technique. The experiments verify its effectiveness against removal attacks.
