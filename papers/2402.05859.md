# [Learning to Route Among Specialized Experts for Zero-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05859)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a proliferation of specialized "expert" language models that are fine-tuned on specific tasks/domains using parameter-efficient methods. These produce a large collection of reusable modules (e.g. LoRAs).
- Separately, large language models (LLMs) are treated as general-purpose models that can perform well on new unseen tasks through zero-shot generalization. 
- An open question is how to leverage collections of specialized modules to improve the zero-shot generalization capabilities of base language models. This could enable decentralized improvement of models without requiring large centralized training.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes PHATGOOSE, which learns to route tokens among the specialized modules in a way that combines their capabilities for improved zero-shot generalization.
- After training each module, an extra step trains a sigmoid gate (with other parameters frozen). This gate determines whether to pass activations into the module.
- Gates from all modules are combined into a top-k router that sends each token to the k modules with the highest gate activation similarity. This enables diverse, adaptive routing.

Contributions:
- Introduces a method to post-hoc learn to route among specialized modules to improve zero-shot generalization, with minimal extra computation.
- Shows routing is more effective when learned in a tokenwise and per-module adaptive way compared to retrieving a single expert.
- Evaluates on T5 adapted with LoRAs, showing performance gains over prior routing methods and sometimes exceeding multitask training.
- Analysis shows the approach finds effective routing strategies that differ from an oracle, by composing diverse skills for generalizability.
- Establishes a framework to improve models in a decentralized way by sharing specialized modules.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a method called PHATGOOSE that learns to route input tokens among specialized expert modules in a post-hoc manner to improve zero-shot generalization of language models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contribution is proposing a method called PHATGOOSE (Post-Hoc Adaptive Tokenwise Gating Over an Ocean of Specialized Experts) for improving zero-shot generalization by routing among a collection of specialized models produced through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Specifically:

- PHATGOOSE introduces an additional step after training each specialized model where a per-module gate is trained with the parameters of the specialized model frozen. This gate determines whether to route a given activation to the module.

- The gates from different specialized models are combined into a router that performs top-k routing among modules at each layer, enabling different experts to be selected in a tokenwise and layerwise manner. 

- Experiments show PHATGOOSE outperforms prior methods for recycling specialized models to improve zero-shot generalization. It also matches or exceeds the performance of explicit multitask training in some cases, despite not requiring simultaneous data access.

- Analysis indicates PHATGOOSE is able to combine knowledge from different experts through its adaptive routing strategy to improve generalization.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing and validating PHATGOOSE as a method for decentralized development of generalist AI systems by recycling specialized models produced by individuals through parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Post-Hoc Adaptive Tokenwise Gating Over an Ocean of Specialized Experts (PHATGOOSE) - The name of the proposed method
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) - The method used to create the specialized expert models
- Low-rank adapters (LoRA) - A specific PEFT method used in the experiments
- Top-k routing - The inference time routing strategy used by PHATGOOSE
- Zero-shot generalization - The capability to perform new tasks without explicit training that PHATGOOSE aims to improve
- Specialized models or experts - Models fine-tuned on a specific task or domain
- Multitask learning - Training a model on multiple datasets/tasks simultaneously
- Decentralized development - Allowing many contributors to collaborate on building a general model

The key focus areas seem to be 1) recycling specialized models to improve zero-shot generalization in a decentralized way, 2) tokenwise and per-module routing, and 3) requiring minimal additional effort from contributors.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What motivated the authors to propose adaptive per-token and per-module routing rather than routing to a single best expert model? What limitations were they trying to address?

2. The paper proposes training a sigmoid gate for each module after the module is trained and frozen. Why is this done rather than jointly training the gates and modules? What effect does this order of operations have?

3. The method trains gates for modules using the same datasets, objectives, and hyperparameters as were used to train the modules themselves. Why is consistency in the training process important here? How might the gates be affected if different datasets or objectives were used?  

4. When forming the router, the method standardizes both the gate vectors and input activations before computing routing scores. Why is this normalization done and how does it impact routing behavior?

5. How does the concept of "decentralized development" that underlies the problem setting relate to trends in model development and the use of specialized versus generalist models? What are the tradeoffs?

6. Beyond performance, what qualitative benefits might the proposed routing strategy offer compared to always routing to the single best expert? How could the capabilities enabled by diverse routing be evaluated?

7. The method trains a gating network to determine routing. How does this differ from and relate to mixture-of-experts models where routing is based on output predictions? What are the tradeoffs?

8. The paper focuses on a setting involving zero-shot generalization. How might the approach need to be modified to work in a few-shot setting where a small labeled dataset is available?

9. What challenges arise when scaling up the number and diversity of expert modules as was done in the experiments? How might the method be extended to improve robustness to large, diverse expert pools?

10. What other module architectures could the method be applied to beyond LoRA? Would any modifications need to be made to handle heterogeneous modules with different architectures?
