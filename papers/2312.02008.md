## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel Multi-Agent Coordination Skill Database to enable teams of robots to efficiently leverage prior experience when adapting to new collaborative tasks. A Transformer-based skill encoder is trained to capture spatio-temporal interactions between agents and objects in a compressed vector representation that is distinctive to specific coordination behaviors. This database stores skill vectors paired with source demonstrations that can be retrieved given new target task demonstrations as queries. A retrieve-and-learn framework is introduced where retrieved demonstrations augment limited target data to train a robust multi-agent control policy. Experiments in simulation and the real-world demonstrate superior performance over baselines and show promising capability to reuse skills across tasks and domains. Key limitations center around sim-to-real gaps causing failures when multiple agents attempt to rotate objects. Overall, this work opens an exciting research direction in reusing multi-agent coordination skills by learning powerful skill representations from prior experience.
