# [ELFNet: Evidential Local-global Fusion for Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the abstract, the key research focus of this paper seems to be developing a new framework called Evidential Local-global Fusion (ELF) for stereo matching that provides:1) Uncertainty estimation - The ELF framework enables estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the disparity predictions. This provides a measure of the model's confidence and helps identify unreliable predictions.2) Reliable multi-view fusion - The framework allows fusing multi-scale cost volumes as well as complementarity between cost-volume-based and transformer-based approaches through evidential fusion modules. This aims to effectively leverage different complementary information to improve accuracy.So in summary, the main research goals are developing a stereo matching framework that can provide uncertainty estimates alongside predictions and reliably fuse different multi-view information sources to boost accuracy and generalization ability. The ELFNet model implementing the ELF framework is proposed to address these goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contributions of this paper are:1. It introduces deep evidential learning to both cost-volume-based and transformer-based stereo matching to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. 2. It proposes a novel evidential local-global fusion (ELF) framework, which enables both uncertainty estimation and two-stage information fusion based on evidence.3. It conducts comprehensive experiments showing that the proposed ELFNet framework consistently boosts performance in terms of accuracy and cross-domain generalization.Specifically, the paper proposes an end-to-end trainable ELFNet that leverages evidential deep learning to estimate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in disparity predictions. It fuses cost-volume-based and transformer-based modules through intra- and inter-evidential fusion using mixtures of normal-inverse gamma distributions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. The main novelty lies in the effective fusion strategy enabled by joint uncertainty modeling.
