# [ELFNet: Evidential Local-global Fusion for Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00728)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the abstract, the key research focus of this paper seems to be developing a new framework called Evidential Local-global Fusion (ELF) for stereo matching that provides:

1) Uncertainty estimation - The ELF framework enables estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the disparity predictions. This provides a measure of the model's confidence and helps identify unreliable predictions.

2) Reliable multi-view fusion - The framework allows fusing multi-scale cost volumes as well as complementarity between cost-volume-based and transformer-based approaches through evidential fusion modules. This aims to effectively leverage different complementary information to improve accuracy.

So in summary, the main research goals are developing a stereo matching framework that can provide uncertainty estimates alongside predictions and reliably fuse different multi-view information sources to boost accuracy and generalization ability. The ELFNet model implementing the ELF framework is proposed to address these goals.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. It introduces deep evidential learning to both cost-volume-based and transformer-based stereo matching to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. 

2. It proposes a novel evidential local-global fusion (ELF) framework, which enables both uncertainty estimation and two-stage information fusion based on evidence.

3. It conducts comprehensive experiments showing that the proposed ELFNet framework consistently boosts performance in terms of accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Specifically, the paper proposes an end-to-end trainable ELFNet that leverages evidential deep learning to estimate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in disparity predictions. It fuses cost-volume-based and transformer-based modules through intra- and inter-evidential fusion using mixtures of normal-inverse gamma distributions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets while providing reliable uncertainty estimates. The main novelty lies in the effective fusion strategy enabled by joint uncertainty modeling.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field of stereo matching:

Overall, this paper introduces a novel framework (ELFNet) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on stereo matching by combining cost-volume-based and transformer-based approaches in a principled way using evidential deep learning. The key novelties are:

- Using evidential deep learning to enable uncertainty estimation and reliable fusion of cost-volume-based and transformer-based stereo matching. This allows the model to leverage the complementary strengths of each approach based on estimated uncertainties. Prior work has not explored evidential learning for fusion in stereo matching.

- Proposing both intra-evidential fusion to combine multi-scale cost volumes and inter-evidential fusion to merge cost-volume and transformer outputs. The mixture of normal-inverse gamma distributions used for fusion is also novel for stereo matching. 

- Consistently outperforming prior top methods like PSMNet, GwcNet, CFNet, etc. on standard datasets like SceneFlow, KITTI, and Middlebury. The improvements are significant, especially on SceneFlow (11-20% better EPE).

- Demonstrating improved cross-domain generalization ability compared to cost-volume (e.g. PCWNet) and transformer (e.g. STTR) baselines. This shows the fusion approach generalizes better.

Overall, the evidential learning framework for fusing cost-volume and transformer approaches is highly novel for stereo matching. The consistent and significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art methods demonstrate its effectiveness. The ideas could be potentially extended to other fusion tasks as well.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring other network architectures and fusion strategies in the evidential local-global fusion framework: The paper used PCWNet and STTR as the cost-volume-based and transformer-based models for fusion. However, the framework could be compatible with other models and fusion strategies as well which could be explored. 

- Extending the approach to other stereo vision tasks beyond just disparity estimation: The evidential learning approach and fusion strategy could potentially benefit other stereo tasks like optical flow estimation, scene flow estimation, etc.

- Improving efficiency and inference speed: The authors acknowledge the inference speed as a limitation due to having two separate model components. Methods to improve efficiency could be explored like constructing sparse cost volumes.

- Evaluating on more diverse datasets: While the approach was evaluated on several datasets, assessing its performance on more diverse datasets could further demonstrate its generalization capability.

- Exploring the estimated uncertainties: The uncertainty estimation itself provides useful information that was not fully explored yet. Future work could analyze the estimated uncertainties in more depth.

- Applications to other domains: The proposed approach could be beneficial for other applications relying on sensor fusion beyond just stereo vision, like in robotics, autonomous vehicles, etc. Exploring these applications could be an interesting direction.

In summary, the main future directions are centered around exploring architectures/fusion strategies, extending the approach to other tasks and domains, improving efficiency, evaluating on more diverse data, analyzing uncertainties, and deploying the approach to real-world applications. The evidential learning framework seems promising for advancing stereo vision research.

This paper introduces the Evidential Local-global Fusion (ELF) framework for stereo matching, which enables both uncertainty estimation and reliable fusion of multi-view information. The framework uses deep evidential learning to estimate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties along with disparity predictions from cost-volume-based and transformer-based models. It proposes an intra evidential fusion module to integrate multi-scale cost volumes and an inter evidential fusion module to combine the complementary outputs from the cost-volume and transformer branches. By modeling the fusion as a mixture of normal-inverse gamma distributions, the framework performs confidence-aware integration of multi-level knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed ELFNet framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets in terms of accuracy and cross-domain generalization by effectively leveraging the strengths of different models according to the estimated uncertainties.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new Evidential Local-global Fusion (ELF) framework for stereo matching. The framework enables uncertainty estimation and reliable fusion of multi-scale and multi-view information. Specifically, the model leverages deep evidential learning to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for disparity prediction. This allows the framework to perform intra evidential fusion of multi-level knowledge from a cost-volume-based model and inter evidential fusion between the cost-volume-based model and a transformer-based model. By fusing models in a trustworthy manner based on uncertainty estimates, the framework exploits their respective strengths and complementary information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ELFNet framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and improved cross-domain generalization on benchmark datasets compared to existing cost-volume-based and transformer-based approaches individually. The framework also provides meaningful uncertainty maps to identify regions of high error risk.

By estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, the framework can fuse multi-scale and multi-view information reliably to improve disparity prediction accuracy and model robustness across domains. The experiments validate the effectiveness of evidential fusion and uncertainty estimation for exploiting complementary strengths of different model types in stereo matching.
