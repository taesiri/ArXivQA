# [Automatic Rao-Blackwellization for Sequential Monte Carlo with Belief   Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09860)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Bayesian inference to estimate the state of complex state-space models (SSMs) over time is generally intractable. 
- Basic sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods yield poor approximations for complex SSMs.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop a mixed inference algorithm that leverages both symbolic computations (when possible) and sampling-based SMC approximations. 
- Use belief propagation on Gaussian trees to perform exact marginalization whenever subsets of the SSM form a tractable Gaussian tree structure.
- Automatically switch between symbolic and sampling-based computations for different parts of the model.

Contributions:
1) A new Julia domain specific language (OnlineSampling.jl) to describe reactive SSMs based on synchronous dataflow concepts.

2) A novel algorithm for online Bayesian inference that mixes belief propagation (for symbolic computations) with particle filtering (for sampling) to automatically Rao-Blackwellize tractable substructures.

3) Empirical evaluation showing the algorithm recovers Kalman filtering for linear SSMs, handles conditioned diffusion processes, and significantly outperforms vanilla particle filters for a tracking example model by exploiting symbolic computations for part of the model.

The key idea is to leverage the tractability of Gaussian tree models via belief propagation wherever possible in an otherwise complex SSM to lower the variance of a particle filter that operates on the remaining intractable parts of the model. The mix of exact and approximate inference is done automatically based on the model structure.
