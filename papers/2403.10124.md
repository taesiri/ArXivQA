# [Depth-induced Saliency Comparison Network for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's   Disease via Jointly Analysis of Visual Stimuli and Eye Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10124)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for timely medical treatment. Traditional methods like cognitive evaluations, medical imaging, and blood tests have limitations in efficiency, complexity, invasiveness, etc. Recent studies show that eye movements can serve as a potential non-invasive biomarker for detecting cognitive abnormalities in AD patients. However, current analysis of eye movements for AD diagnosis has limited exploration of visual saliency features. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Deep learning-based Depth-induced Saliency Comparison Network (DISCN) that jointly utilizes eye movements and visual stimuli for AD diagnosis. The key ideas are:

1) Evaluate comprehensive visual saliency maps by fusing RGB images, depth images of visual stimuli, and heatmaps of normal eye movements using a depth-included salient attention module. This captures salient information from both stimuli and healthy behaviors. 

2) Introduce a saliency-aware serial attention module to extract discriminative serial features from comprehensive saliency maps and subject saliency maps separately. This focuses on the most abnormal eye movements of subjects.  

3) Feed the serial features into MLP classifier to differentiate AD patients from normal controls.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose DISCN that introduces visual saliency analysis and deep learning for efficient AD diagnosis using eye movements and visual stimuli.

2) Design a depth-included salient attention module to evaluate comprehensive visual saliency maps by fusing RGB, depth images of stimuli and heatmaps of normal eye movements.

3) Introduce a saliency-aware serial attention module to emphasize the most discriminative serial features from stimuli and subject eye movements.

4) Conduct experiments on a collected dataset and show superior performances over state-of-the-art methods, proving the effectiveness of DISCN for AD diagnosis.

In summary, this paper explores a new direction of using visual saliency analysis and deep learning for AD diagnosis based on eye movements and visual stimuli. The proposed DISCN provides a potential non-invasive and efficient solution for early detection of AD by jointly modeling stimuli and behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper proposes a depth-induced saliency comparison network (DISCN) that jointly analyzes visual stimuli and eye movements for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using a multi-image integration module and a serial attention module.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel deep learning-based network called Depth-induced Integrated Comparison serial attention Network (DISCN) for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by jointly analyzing visual stimuli and eye movements. 

2. The DISCN contains two key modules: (1) An integration module to fuse visual stimuli (RGB and depth images) with eye movement heatmaps for comprehensive visual saliency evaluation. (2) A serial attention module to extract temporal visual saliency features related to AD cognitive decline.

3. Conducting extensive experiments that demonstrate the proposed DISCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying AD patients and normal controls based on the collected visual saliency dataset. The ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of the depth integration, normals integration, residual feature extraction, and serial attention fusion modules in the DISCN.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing the DISCN network architecture that effectively integrates visual stimuli and eye movements for AD diagnosis, and validating its performance through experiments. The integration and serial attention modules are key to the network's capabilities.

The paper proposes a depth-induced saliency comparison network (DISCN) to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by jointly analyzing visual stimuli and corresponding eye movements collected during a free viewing task. Key elements include using a salient attention module to evaluate comprehensive visual saliency maps from RGB-D images and heatmaps, and a serial attention module to extract temporal features and make a diagnosis.
