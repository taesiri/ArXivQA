## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for timely medical treatment. Traditional methods like cognitive evaluations, medical imaging, and blood tests have limitations in efficiency, complexity, invasiveness, etc. Recent studies show that eye movements can serve as a potential non-invasive biomarker for detecting cognitive abnormalities in AD patients. However, current analysis of eye movements for AD diagnosis has limited exploration of visual saliency features. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a novel Deep learning-based Depth-induced Saliency Comparison Network (DISCN) that jointly utilizes eye movements and visual stimuli for AD diagnosis. The key ideas are:

1) Evaluate comprehensive visual saliency maps by fusing RGB images, depth images of visual stimuli, and heatmaps of normal eye movements using a depth-included salient attention module. This captures salient information from both stimuli and healthy behaviors. 

2) Introduce a saliency-aware serial attention module to extract discriminative serial features from comprehensive saliency maps and subject saliency maps separately. This focuses on the most abnormal eye movements of subjects.  

3) Feed the serial features into MLP classifier to differentiate AD patients from normal controls.

Main Contributions:

1) Propose DISCN that introduces visual saliency analysis and deep learning for efficient AD diagnosis using eye movements and visual stimuli.

2) Design a depth-included salient attention module to evaluate comprehensive visual saliency maps by fusing RGB, depth images of stimuli and heatmaps of normal eye movements.

3) Introduce a saliency-aware serial attention module to emphasize the most discriminative serial features from stimuli and subject eye movements.

4) Conduct experiments on a collected dataset and show superior performances over state-of-the-art methods, proving the effectiveness of DISCN for AD diagnosis.

In summary, this paper explores a new direction of using visual saliency analysis and deep learning for AD diagnosis based on eye movements and visual stimuli. The proposed DISCN provides a potential non-invasive and efficient solution for early detection of AD by jointly modeling stimuli and behaviors.
