# [Investigating Data Contamination for Pre-training Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06059)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but there are concerns about whether their performance relies on evaluation data being contaminated in the pre-training corpus. This phenomenon is known as data contamination.  
- There has been little analysis on the impact of data contamination during pre-training. Most studies investigate contamination post-training by dividing evaluation data into contaminated/non-contaminated.
- Contamination can occur in two forms - text of evaluation samples being present in pre-training data (text contamination), or text plus the prompts and labels also being present (ground truth contamination). The effects of these are unclear.
- Recent LLM studies have used n-gram based definitions of contamination. But these may be insufficient to accurately identify contamination.

Proposed Solution:
- Pre-train a series of GPT-2 small and large models from scratch with deliberately added data contamination to analyze its effects.
- Consider both text contamination and ground truth contamination. 
- Vary the contamination levels by repeating evaluation data multiple times during pre-training.
- Filter different amounts of data labeled as contaminated by n-gram methods to evaluate effectiveness of definitions.
- Compare performance on several NLP tasks - SST-2, CNN/Daily Mail, MMLU, SQuAD.

Key Contributions:
- Identify that ground truth contamination has a greater effect of boosting performance than text contamination.
- Find that the relationship between contamination levels and performance can be U-shaped - performance initially improves then declines with more repetitions.
- Show that removing large portions of data marked contaminated by n-gram methods does not affect performance much.
- Critically analyze current LLM evaluations, suggesting they may not adequately confirm robustness to contamination.
- Underscore the need for better contamination definitions and more rigorous contamination assessments in LLM studies.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper investigates the effects of data contamination in the pre-training corpus for language models by pre-training multiple GPT-2 models from scratch with deliberately introduced contamination, revealing performance improvements from contamination and limitations of existing contamination definitions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions are:

1) The paper empirically investigates the effects of data contamination in the pre-training corpus for language models by pre-training models from scratch under different contamination mechanisms. This allows them to study the impact of contamination during pre-training.

2) The paper identifies the importance of considering contamination involving the ground truths (prompts and labels) from evaluation datasets, not just the input texts. The paper finds that ground truth contamination can have a more significant impact than just text contamination.

3) The paper analyzes the effect of repeating contamination in the pre-training corpus, finding that the impact on performance can be U-shaped - performance improves up to a point but declines with further repetition. 

4) The paper critically analyzes existing n-gram based definitions of contamination used in language model reports, finding them to be insufficient and inadequate for properly identifying contamination.

In summary, the main contribution is an empirical analysis of different types of data contamination during pre-training and their effects on model performance, highlighting limitations of current methods for assessing contamination.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Data contamination: The paper focuses on investigating data contamination where evaluation data is leaked into the pre-training corpus of language models. This impacts model performance.

- Ground truth contamination: An important aspect studied is contamination involving not just input texts but also the ground truth like labels and answers paired with the texts. This can have a more pronounced effect than just text contamination.

- Pre-training analysis: The paper conducts analysis at the pre-training level by intentionally altering the pre-training corpus, as opposed to just doing evaluation-level analysis. 

- Repeated contamination: The paper studies the impact of repeating evaluation data multiple times in the pre-training corpus, finding a potential U-shaped performance trend.

- N-gram based definitions: The paper analyzes and critiques current n-gram based definitions of contamination used in language model papers, finding them inadequate.

- Robustness evaluation: The common practice of checking model robustness to contamination by separating evaluation data into clean/contaminated chunks is also critically analyzed.

In summary, key terms revolve around data contamination, pre-training analysis, ground truth contamination, effects of repeated contamination, n-gram based definitions, and evaluation of robustness.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. How does the paper categorize the two main types of contamination that can occur from evaluation data leakage into the pre-training corpus? What are the key differences between these two types of contamination?

2. Why does the paper argue that ground truth contamination has been an overlooked aspect in existing studies on data contamination? What evidence does the paper provide to demonstrate the impact of ground truth contamination? 

3. The paper finds that the effects of repeated contamination can be U-shaped. What explanations does the paper offer for this phenomenon and under what conditions might this U-shaped pattern not universally hold?

4. What are some limitations of existing n-gram based definitions of contamination that the paper highlights? How do the empirical analyses in the paper reveal these deficiencies?  

5. What explanations does the paper provide for why ground truth contamination appears more impactful than text contamination for certain tasks like summarization and question answering?

6. How does the paper design the pre-training framework and choice of hyperparameters to facilitate a fair comparison between models trained on contaminated vs non-contaminated data?

7. What are some ways the paper suggests existing evaluation-level contamination analyses used in LLM reports may fall short? How could these assessments be strengthened?

8. Why does the paper argue that methods based solely on membership inference are insufficient for understanding the effects of contamination? What complementary analyses does the paper provide?  

9. How does the paper investigate the impacts of contamination with larger scale models compared to small models? What effects persist despite increased model and data scale?

10. What directions for future research does the paper identify regarding better understanding data contamination in language model pre-training and evaluation?
