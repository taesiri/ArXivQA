# [Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06782)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: As AI systems continue to advance, they will eventually surpass human capabilities. This poses an alignment challenge - how can weaker systems provide oversight over more capable systems when traditional approaches of using human-labeled data and evaluation will no longer be feasible. 

Proposed Solution: The paper proposes using debate between AI systems as a mechanism for oversight and alignment. In a debate setup, two expert models argue for opposing answers to a question while a weaker, non-expert model or human acts as a judge to determine the winning side. The key intuition is that identifying truth may be easier than generating truth.

The paper specifically looks at an information-asymmetric setup using the QuALITY reading comprehension dataset. Expert models have access to the full passages while non-expert judges do not, simulating stronger vs weaker systems. 

Main Contributions:

- Show that both human and AI judges can use debate to accurately answer questions, outperforming non-adversarial consultancy baselines. Humans and AI judges achieve 88% and 76% accuracy with debate.

- Find that optimizing experts for "persuasiveness" also makes them better at arguing for the correct side - an advantage increases as persuasiveness increases. This suggests training via debate could improve truthfulness.

- Surface challenges unique to AI judges - biases like verbosity, position and overconfidence. Mitigation strategies and judge iterations are provided.

- Establish unsupervised metrics like Elo ratings and aggregate win rate that enable optimizing debates without human labels.

- Demonstrate scalability to different expert base models and generalization to unseen judges.

The results provide encouraging evidence that weaker systems can help align stronger systems using debate as one oversight approach, presenting opportunities for further research.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper investigates using debate between language models to help weaker models or humans evaluate the correctness of stronger language models, finding that debate can improve oversight if the stronger models are optimized to be persuasive.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is providing empirical evidence that debate can be an effective method for weaker models or humans to evaluate and align stronger language models, even in situations where ground truth labels are not available. Specifically, the key findings are:

1) Both human and LLM judges are able to identify the correct answers more accurately in debates compared to non-adversarial consultancy baselines. 

2) Optimizing debaters to be more persuasive based on judge preference, without using any labels, improves the judge's ability to identify truth. This effect gets stronger as debaters get more capable.

3) With optimized debaters, human judges can achieve high accuracy in identifying the correct answers, even exceeding the accuracy of language models alone. Human judges are also better calibrated when using debate compared to consultancy.

In summary, the paper demonstrates the promise of debate as a mechanism for scalable oversight of language models by weaker models or humans, providing a path towards safe and reliable language technology.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it include:

- Debate - The paper investigates using debate between language models as a method for alignment and oversight. 

- Persuasiveness - A key concept explored is optimizing the debaters for persuasiveness using metrics like Elo ratings and win rate.

- QuALITY - The Question Answering with Long Input Texts, Yes! comprehension dataset is used as the basis for the debate experiments.

- Information asymmetry - The paper sets up an information asymmetric debate where the debaters have access to privileged information (the full text) that the judges do not.

- Scalable oversight - A core motivation of the work is developing debate as a mechanism for scalable oversight of AI systems, without reliance on human labels.

- Language models - Various large language models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude are used as both debaters and judges.

- Human evaluation - In addition to LLM judges, human judges are used to evaluate debate transcripts.

Some other potentially relevant terms: adversarial collaboration, weak supervision, model alignment. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. This paper argues that debate can be an effective method for weaker models to supervise stronger models. Do you think debate would remain effective if the strength gap between models grows even wider in the future, for example between a GPT-3 model and a more advanced GPT-8 model? Why or why not?  

2. The paper tests debate in an information-asymmetric setting where the debaters have access to a story text that judges do not. Do you think debate would be equally effective in a capability-asymmetric setting where debaters and judges have the same information but differ significantly in reasoning ability?

3. One limitation noted is that the debaters use an honest quoting system that prevents them from fabricating false evidence. How do you think the results would differ if debaters could make up 'fake news' - would this advantage the incorrect debater?  

4. The paper finds optimizing debaters for persuasiveness improves truth-seeking ability. Do you foresee potential risks if optimizing too aggressively for persuasiveness over truthfulness? How might the interplay between truth and persuasiveness evolve?

5. Could debate also be used by the judge model itself to improve its own accuracy? For example, could an ensemble of GPT judge models debate internally before making a final prediction?  

6. The best debaters use critique and refinement to strengthen their arguments. Do you think allowing the judge model to also suggest critiques between debate rounds could improve accuracy further? What challenges might this introduce?

7. The paper focuses on reading comprehension - what other domains could you envision debate being an effective evaluation protocol for LLMs? Where might it struggle?

8. The paper uses Elo rating to measure debaters' persuasiveness. Can you think of other unsupervised metrics that could be used to capture debater skill? What are the tradeoffs?  

9. Human judges seem to benefit less from interaction compared to LLM judges in the debate setting. Why might this be the case, and how could the protocol be altered to give more value to human interactivity?

10. The paper finds better calibration for human judges under debate versus consultancy. Do you think debate leads to genuine improvement in human calibration, or might it simply appear better calibrated due to the adversarial setup? How could this be tested?
