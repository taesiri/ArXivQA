# [Minimize Quantization Output Error with Bias Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01892)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Minimize Quantization Output Error with Bias Compensation":

Problem:
- Quantization is important for reducing the computational cost of deep neural networks, but often leads to significant output errors that degrade model performance. 
- Prior quantization methods optimize the non-convex quantization process itself, which is difficult.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a novel Bias Compensation (BC) method to directly minimize output error by identifying an optimal bias vector to compensate the quantized output, without needing to optimize the quantization process.

- BC adds a learnable bias vector after each quantized layer. Finding the optimal bias vector to minimize output error is proven to be a convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved to guarantee minimal output error.

- BC does not affect quantization efficiency since the bias vector is added after expensive operations like matrix multiplications. It introduces very little additional computation.

Key Contributions:
- Proves the convexity of using BC to minimize output error and provides an efficient strategy to obtain optimal solutions.

- Theoretically guarantees BC will always achieve lower output error for a given quantizer.

- Experiments on Vision Transformers and Large Language Models show BC can enable aggressive low-precision quantization (e.g. 4-bit) and substantially enhance model accuracy.

- For example, BC improves 4-bit quantized ViT-B* accuracy by 36.89% on ImageNet-1K. It reduces perplexity of 3-bit quantized OPT-350M by 5.97 on WikiText2 dataset.

In summary, the key innovation is a bias compensation method that can directly and efficiently minimize quantization output error to enable better ultra low-precision quantization, with theoretical guarantees. Experiments verify its effectiveness.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes Bias Compensation (BC) to directly minimize the output error caused by quantization by solving for an optimal bias vector, rather than optimizing the non-convex quantization process itself.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel method called Bias Compensation (BC) to minimize the output error caused by quantization in neural networks. Specifically:

1) It proposes BC which adds an optimizable bias vector after each quantized layer to compensate for the quantization-induced output error. This is a new perspective compared to previous methods that try to optimize the non-convex quantization process.

2) It proves that optimizing the bias vector to minimize output error is a convex optimization problem, and the optimal analytical solution can be easily obtained without model fine-tuning. This guarantees finding the solution for minimal output error.  

3) It theoretically proves that applying BC can always guarantee lower output error compared to not using BC, given the same quantizer and calibration dataset.

4) Experiments on Vision Transformers and Large Language Models demonstrate that BC can significantly reduce quantization output error and improve task performance of quantized models, especially for ultra-low precision cases like 4-bit, 3-bit or 2-bit quantization. For example, BC improves 4-bit quantized ViT-B* accuracy by 36.89% on ImageNet.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing BC as a novel, convex method to effectively minimize quantization output error and enable better performance for ultra-low precision quantized neural networks.
