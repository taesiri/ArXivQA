## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Most existing monocular 3D object detection methods require expensive 3D box annotations, which are labor intensive to collect at scale. Recently, weakly supervised monocular 3D detection methods have been explored to avoid costly 3D annotations. However, these methods typically require additional data such as LiDAR point clouds or multi-view images, limiting applicability. The key research question is - can we achieve weakly supervised monocular 3D detection using only single-view images?

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a novel weakly supervised monocular 3D detection framework called SKD-WM3D that works with only single-view RGB images. The key idea is a self-knowledge distillation framework consisting of two networks - A depth-guided self-teaching network (DSN) and a monocular 3D detection network (MDN). 

The DSN incorporates depth information from an off-the-shelf depth estimator into the features to predict 3D boxes. It acts as the teacher network, guiding the student MDN network. The MDN aims to predict 3D boxes from monocular images alone, by distilling knowledge from the DSN. Two additional components are proposed - An uncertainty-aware distillation loss to focus on more reliable knowledge, and a gradient-based transfer modulation strategy to synchronize the learning between the two networks.

During inference, only the lightweight MDN network is used, extracting 3D information intrinsically from the monocular image with no overhead from external depth estimation.

Main Contributions:

1) A self-knowledge distillation framework for weakly supervised monocular 3D detection using only single-view RGB images 

2) Uncertainty-aware distillation loss to selectively transfer more reliable knowledge

3) Gradient-targeted transfer modulation strategy to synchronize learning between the teacher and student networks

The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to weakly supervised techniques on KITTI and nuScenes datasets. It also matches performance of some fully supervised techniques without requiring any 3D annotations. Qualitative results further demonstrate the high accuracy in predicting 3D boxes from monocular images.
