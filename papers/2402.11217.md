# [Asclepius: A Spectrum Evaluation Benchmark for Medical Multi-Modal Large   Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11217)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Current benchmarks for evaluating Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have limitations:
1) Unsuitable for assessing sophisticated capabilities of Med-MLLMs due to not covering the intricate real-world diagnostic frameworks involving diverse medical specialties and complex clinical decisions.  
2) Susceptible to data leakage since Med-MLLMs are trained on large publicly available data, leading to inflated performance.
Thus, there is a need for an isolated, clinically representative benchmark for credible evaluation of Med-MLLMs.

Proposed Solution - Asclepius Benchmark:
The paper proposes Asclepius, a meticulously designed benchmark for comprehensively evaluating Med-MLLMs based on:
1) Medical Specialties - Includes 15 major specialties concerning different organs and full-body systems. 
2) Capabilities - Divided into 3 main (perception, diagnosis, planning) and 8 sub-categories that reflect intricacies of clinical decision making.  
3) Originality - Uses data from educational materials and datasets not in Med-MLLM training to avoid leakage.

Additionally, a website is launched for integrity of evaluation through server-side scoring of model predictions.

Main Contributions:  
1) A systematically-constructed multi-specialty, multi-capacity benchmark dataset with 3,232 multi-modal QA pairs and 15 specialties.
2) Comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 6 Med-MLLMs and 5 human doctors, providing insights into model competencies and limitations.  
3) A precedent and standard for reliable future assessments and clinical deployment of Med-MLLMs. 

The benchmark advances understanding of Med-MLLM capabilities and overall pushes progress in developing safe and effective AI for healthcare.
