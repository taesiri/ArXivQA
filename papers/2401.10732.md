# [Bridging the gap between image coding for machines and humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10732)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Image coding for machines (ICM) aims to compress images to reduce storage and transmission costs while preserving the accuracy of machine vision tasks. However, ICM codecs often produce visually unpleasant checkerboard artifacts, especially at low bitrates. This degrades quality for human viewing, which is important in applications like surveillance.

- Existing solutions either use separate coding branches (increasing complexity and bitrate) or directly optimize for human-centric metrics (hurting task performance). There is a need for improving visual quality without these downsides.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors propose a finetuning method using adversarial training to suppress checkerboard artifacts in ICM codecs. A PatchGAN discriminator is trained to distinguish real image patches from compressed patches based on the artifact patterns.

- Only the decoder layers of a pretrained ICM codec are finetuned. This removes artifacts while keeping the encoder frozen, preserving the bitrate. The finetuning uses an adversarial loss from the PatchGAN plus an L2 reconstruction loss.

Contributions:
- The method effectively eliminates checkerboard artifacts with negligible impact on task performance (-1.6% mAP) and no change in bitrate.

- In cases where some artifacts are acceptable, limiting the adversarial impact during finetuning improves visual metrics without reducing task performance.

- The study shows only a small subset of codec parameters needs finetuning for artifact removal. This highlights which parts of the network contribute to the artifacts.

- The proposed finetuning scheme enhances visual quality of ICM codecs without extra network components or bitstreams, keeping the system simple. The method is broadly applicable to other learned codecs.

In summary, the key idea is finetuning part of a pretrained ICM codec's decoder using adversarial training to suppress artifacts for improved visual quality, with little impact on task performance or bitrate.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel finetuning scheme using adversarial training to significantly enhance the visual quality of learned image coding for machines codecs without compromising machine task performance or adding extra bitcost.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel training technique to improve the visual quality of images compressed by an image coding for machines (ICM) codec. Specifically, the paper proposes finetuning selected layers of a pretrained ICM codec decoder using a PatchGAN adversarial training mechanism. The key results are:

- The proposed finetuning scheme effectively eliminates the checkerboard artifacts commonly found in ICM codec outputs, significantly enhancing visual quality without adding extra bitcost or parameters at inference time. 

- The improved visual quality comes at a negligible cost to machine task performance (-1.6% relative change). In cases where some artifacts are tolerable, the technique can enhance both pixel and feature fidelity scores without losing task performance.

- The method requires finetuning only a small subset of codec parameters that are responsible for the artifacts. This allows efficient finetuning.

In summary, the main contribution is an effective adversarial finetuning technique to bridge the gap between image coding quality for machines and humans, by improving visual quality while preserving machine task performance.

The paper proposes an effective decoder finetuning scheme using adversarial training with PatchGAN to improve the visual quality of outputs from neural network-based image codecs for machines. The key goals are to remove checkerboard artifacts while preserving accuracy on machine vision tasks, without increasing bitrate or model complexity. The method leverages generative adversarial networks and specifically the PatchGAN technique to finetune part of the decoder via an adversarial loss. Overall, the key terms reflect the application of GANs to finetune and enhance neural network codecs targeting machine consumption while also improving quality for human viewers.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel training technique involving finetuning the decoder of a pretrained image codec using adversarial training with a PatchGAN discriminator. What is the intuition behind using a PatchGAN discriminator instead of a normal GAN discriminator? What advantages does this provide?

2. The finetuning process updates only the first 2 layers of the decoder. What is the rationale behind choosing to update just these layers? How does updating fewer layers impact training time and resource requirements?

3. The paper finds that a patch size of 32x32 performs worse than larger patch sizes like 64x64. Why might smaller patch sizes lead to poorer performance? What is the impact of patch size on the context seen by the discriminator?

4. What is the effect of using different numbers of patches (1, 3, 5) on the performance? Is there a sweet spot or does increasing the number of patches monotonically improve performance? 

5. How does the choice of loss function for the discriminator impact performance? Would using a different adversarial loss lead to better artifact removal? 

6. The method introduces a hyperparameter Î»_a to weight the adversarial loss term. How does varying this hyperparameter impact the tradeoff between task performance and visual quality?

7. The paper shows the method can eliminate checkerboard artifacts with minimal impact (-1.6%) on task performance. What is responsible for this remaining gap? How could the method be modified to completely eliminate the gap?

8. Can you suggest other techniques besides adversarial training that could potentially improve the visual quality while preserving task performance? How might these compare?

9. The method leverages correlations between features extracted from different layers of a CNN. How does this proxy loss enable more efficient training? Are there other proxy losses that could work as well or better?

10. How well would you expect the proposed finetuning technique to generalize to other learned image codecs? What adjustments might be required to apply this method to a different base codec architecture?
