# [API Is Enough: Conformal Prediction for Large Language Models Without   Logit-Access](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01216)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) is important but challenging, especially when logit access is unavailable in some API-only models.  
- Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods rely on logits, which can be miscalibrated, leading to poor CP performance.

Proposed Solution:  
- A novel CP method called LofreeCP that works for LLMs without logit access.
- Defines nonconformity measures using coarse-grained uncertainty (response frequency) and fine-grained notions (normalized entropy and semantic similarity) to address concentration issues.

Key Contributions:
- First CP method for LLMs without logit access with coverage guarantee and small prediction sets.
- Proves it's infeasible to use sampling frequency to estimate probability. 
- Proposes using frequency as proxy for probability ranking.
- Adds fine-grained uncertainty measures to mitigate issue of concentrated nonconformity scores.
- Demonstrates superior performance over baselines on question answering and shows generalizability to multiple LLMs.
- Provides theoretical guarantee on coverage rate.

In summary, this paper introduces a novel way to perform conformal prediction on large language models without access to model logits. By using both coarse and fine-grained uncertainty measures, it is able to efficiently generate high quality prediction sets that have rigorous coverage guarantees. Experiments show it outperforms previous conformal prediction methods that rely on logits.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper introduces a novel conformal prediction method for quantifying uncertainty in large language models without access to model logits, using frequency, normalized entropy, and semantic similarity to define nonconformity measures.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel conformal prediction (CP) method called LofreeCP that:

1) Enables CP for large language models (LLMs) without requiring access to model logits. This allows LofreeCP to be applied to API-only LLMs where logits are not accessible. 

2) Defines a nonconformity score function using both coarse-grained (response frequency) and fine-grained (normalized entropy and semantic similarity) uncertainty measures. This helps address the issue of nonconformity score concentration and improves the efficiency of the prediction sets.

3) Provides rigorous theoretical guarantees on the coverage rate for the prediction sets generated.

4) Demonstrates superior empirical performance over both logit-based and logit-free baseline CP methods on question answering tasks using models like Llama and Vicuna.

In summary, the key contribution is introducing a CP approach tailored for API-only LLMs that produces efficient prediction sets with coverage guarantees, without relying on potentially miscalibrated logits.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper proposes using both coarse-grained and fine-grained uncertainty measures as nonconformity scores. Can you explain more about why this combination of measures helps mitigate the concentration issue and improve prediction set efficiency?

2. One of the fine-grained measures proposed is normalized entropy (NE). What specifically does NE capture about the uncertainty of the model's predictions? How does it help with concentration issues across different prompts?

3. The other fine-grained measure proposed is semantic similarity (SS). What is the intuition behind using SS to measure uncertainty within a prompt? How does it capture useful signal that frequency alone misses? 

4. Lemma 1 proves that it's computationally infeasible to use sampling frequency to accurately estimate probability. Can you walk through the key steps in this proof and why it led to using frequency only as a proxy for rankings rather than actual probabilities?

5. The method assumes no logit access. What are some potential issues with using logits for conformal prediction, and how does the proposed approach avoid those pitfalls?

6. One finding is that the proposed method works better on TriviaQA than WebQuestions. What differences between the datasets could explain this performance gap? How might the method be adapted to improve WebQuestions performance?

7. The sensitivity analysis surfaces an interesting finding about lower vs higher sampling quantities. What is that finding and what might explain it? How would you recommend setting the sampling quantity?

8. What is the role of the Î» hyperparameters in balancing the coarse and fine-grained uncertainty signals? How would you go about tuning their values? Are there any methods you would propose to automate this?

9. The method shows strong performance on both QA and MCQ tasks. What adaptations were required to make the approach work for MCQ? Would any other adjustments help further improve MCQ coverage?

10. One limitation raised is the unbounded output space for open-ended NLG tasks. How does the method handle this? Can you propose any extensions to address that limitation more robustly?
