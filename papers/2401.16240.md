# [Clinically meaningful timeline summarisation in social media for mental   health monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16240)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is little prior work on generating clinically meaningful summaries of social media user timelines to monitor individuals' mental health progression over time. Such summaries with high-level insights and supporting evidence would be very useful for clinicians.

- Existing timeline summarization work focuses on news articles and events, not the messy, evolving nature of user-generated content. Existing methods for mental health summarization lack a focus on capturing changes over time.

Method:
- Proposes a novel 2-layer timeline summarization approach to create abstractive clinically meaningful summaries consisting of:
  (1) High-level information useful for clinicians covering diagnosis, inter- and intrapersonal patterns and moments of changes
  (2) Corresponding evidence from the user's timeline supporting the high-level observations

- Timeline summarization is done via an adapted hierarchical variational autoencoder model (TH-VAE) focused on mental health keyphrases. This captures semantic features and long-range dependencies between user's varying states.

- High-level summary generation prompts a large language model (LLaMA-2) in a multi-stage process to extract clinically useful inferences from the timeline summary.

Contributions:
- Defines a new task: clinically meaningful summarization of social media timelines for mental health monitoring

- Develops a novel approach utilizing TH-VAE for timeline summarization and clinical prompts for high-level summary generation  

- Creates a dataset of expert annotated and written mental health summaries from social media timelines

- Proposes detailed automatic and manual evaluations assessing clinical utility along multiple facets

- Experiments show summaries from the proposed TH-VAE approach result in logically coherent narratives better at capturing changes over time compared to LLM-only summarization


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new task of generating two-layer clinically meaningful summaries from social media timelines, comprising high-level information useful for clinicians as well as corresponding evidence from timelines, using a novel unsupervised abstractive method combining a hierarchical variational autoencoder for timeline summarization and an instructed large language model for high-level summary generation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a new task of creating clinically meaningful summaries from social media user timelines. These summaries have a novel two-layer structure consisting of high-level information useful for clinicians as well as corresponding evidence from the timelines.

2. Developing a novel timeline summarization method based on adapting a hierarchical variational autoencoder (TH-VAE) to represent long texts and guide the summary using mentally health related key phrases. 

3. Creating a dataset of expert-written mental health summaries from longitudinal social media data. A small sample is used for modeling and the rest for evaluation.

4. Providing a detailed evaluation method of the generated summaries based on preservation of clinical information, consistency, and usefulness, using semantic similarity metrics, natural language inference, and expert human evaluation.  

5. Conducting experiments with different unsupervised summarization baselines like LLM- and skeleton-based methods, showing superior performance of the proposed TH-VAE approach in capturing changes over time.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a new task and method for generating two-layer clinically meaningful summaries from social media timelines using a timeline summarization approach based on a adapted hierarchical variational autoencoder.

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Clinically meaningful timeline summarization
- Mental health monitoring
- Social media timelines
- Abstractive summarization
- Hierarchical variational autoencoder (TH-VAE)
- Large language model (LLM)
- High-level summary

The paper introduces the task of generating two-layer summaries from social media timelines for mental health monitoring. The summaries contain high-level clinical information as well as supporting evidence from the timeline. A key method is the timeline summarization using an adapted hierarchical VAE model called TH-VAE. The evaluation involves both automatic metrics and human judgement to assess the informativeness and usefulness of generated summaries.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a novel two-layer summarization approach consisting of a high-level summary and evidence summary. What is the motivation behind this two-layer structure and what are the key differences between the high-level and evidence summaries?

2. The Timeline Hierarchical VAE (TH-VAE) is introduced as a key component of the evidence summary generation. Explain in detail how the hierarchical structure and partitioning of latent variables in TH-VAE helps capture semantics and long-range dependencies in lengthy timelines.  

3. The paper utilizes key phrases in the TH-VAE model. Explain the process of obtaining key phrases, how they are incorporated into TH-VAE, and why the ablation studies show that key phrases are important for the model's performance.

4. The high-level summaries are generated by prompting a large language model. Walk through the multi-stage prompting framework in detail and explain how the instructions and prompts are designed to extract clinically meaningful information. 

5. The paper evaluates the summaries using both automatic metrics and human evaluation. Compare and contrast the types of metrics used to assess different qualities such as coherence, usefulness, factual consistency etc. What are the limitations of automatic evaluation?

6. Besides the baselines compared in the paper, what other competitive unsupervised abstractive summarization methods could be potential alternatives? Explain how you might modify those methods for the longitudinal mental health summarization task.

7. The gold standard summaries used for evaluation are written by clinical experts. Discuss potential biases that could be present in expert-annotated summaries and how that might impact automatic evaluation. 

8. The paper focuses exclusively on summarizing TalkLife data. Discuss challenges that might arise in applying the models to summarize other types of mental health data like therapy transcripts.

9. The TH-VAE model utilizes MoC annotations on the timelines during training. How does reliance on these annotations pose limitations when applying the model to unlabeled data?

10. The paper identifies several limitations around the timeline segmentation strategy, handling of non-disclosure, generalizability across data types etc. For each limitation, suggest ways the method could be adapted or enhanced to address it.
