# [Learning time-dependent PDE via graph neural networks and deep operator   network for robust accuracy on irregular grids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08187)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem:
- Simulating time-dependent PDEs is important for modeling many physical phenomena, but poses challenges especially for handling irregular spatial grids and enabling time extrapolation.  
- Existing operator learning models like DeepONet struggle with time extrapolation and handling irregular grids.
- Other graph-based PDE solvers predict only on specific grids used for training.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes GraphDeepONet, a model combining graph neural networks (GNNs) and DeepONet.
- It uses a GNN-based branch net to incorporate time information instead of the DeepONet trunk net. This enables time extrapolation.
- GraphDeepONet leverages DeepONet's trunk net to learn continuous spatial basis functions. This allows prediction on arbitrary grids, unlike other graph-based PDE solvers.

Key Contributions:
- GraphDeepONet outperforms DeepONet variants and other graph-based models on irregular grids for various PDEs.
- It maintains robust performance on irregular grids while enabling time extrapolation.
- Theoretical analysis shows GraphDeepONet can approximate continuous operators over arbitrary time intervals.
- Experiments on Burgers' equation, shallow water equations and Navier-Stokes equations demonstrate accuracy and generalizability of GraphDeepONet.

In summary, by effectively adapting DeepONet using graph neural networks, GraphDeepONet advances the state-of-the-art in learning time-dependent PDE solutions, with strengths in handling irregular grids and extrapolation over time. Theoretical and empirical evidence supports its efficacy.
