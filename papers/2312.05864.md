# [Finding Concept Representations in Neural Networks with Self-Organizing   Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05864)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Neural networks lack transparency - it is difficult to understand the relationship between the internal activations/weights and the predictions they make. 
- However, some form of implicit conceptual representation is expected to exist within the activation vectors to support the predictive task. 
- The paper aims to develop a methodology to identify and locate conceptual knowledge representations within a neural network's layers.

Proposed Solution: 
- Use self-organizing maps (SOMs) to create 2D abstraction of the high-dimensional activation vectors in a neural network. 
- Build a "base SOM" for each layer based on activations for the full dataset.  
- Build "concept SOMs" for subsets of data corresponding to concepts of interest.
- Compare concept SOMs to base SOMs using measures like relative entropy to assess representation of concepts.

Key Contributions:
- Method to visually and computationally inspect activation vectors to identify neural representations of concepts.  
- Can help understand importance of concepts for the network's predictions.
- Allows identification of potential biases if irrelevant concepts are found to be important.
- Tested on neural networks for text classification and image regression tasks.  
- Showed the approach can successfully identify gender, artistic movement, ethnicity representations.
- Relative entropy of concept SOM vs base SOM found to be a good measure of concept representation.

In summary, the paper proposes a way to make neural networks more interpretable by locating conceptual knowledge representations, highlighting their approach of using SOMs and relative entropy measures. This helps to understand and potentially reduce biases.
