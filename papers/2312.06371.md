# [BAT: Behavior-Aware Human-Like Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous   Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06371)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel behavior-aware trajectory prediction model (BAT) for autonomous vehicles that aims to mimic human-like reasoning for more accurate predictions. BAT consists of four key modules - behavior-aware, interaction-aware, priority-aware, and position-aware. The behavior-aware module uses concepts from traffic psychology and dynamic geometric graphs to continuously model driving behaviors without manual labeling. The interaction-aware module leverages a hierarchical LSTM encoder and polar coordinates to better capture interactions between vehicles. The priority-aware module assigns importance weights to surrounding vehicles using an attention mechanism. Finally, the position-aware module encodes the ego vehicle's trajectory history with an LSTM. BAT is evaluated on multiple datasets - NGSIM, HighD, RounD, and a new right-hand-drive dataset MoCAD. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even when trained on just 25% of data, demonstrating accuracy and robustness. Key innovations include the behavior-aware modeling without manual labeling, the polar coordinate interaction pooling, and consistently strong performance across diverse scenarios. By incorporating human-like reasoning, BAT represents a major advance in developing autonomous vehicles that can anticipate motions as adeptly as human drivers.
