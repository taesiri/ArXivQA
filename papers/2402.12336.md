# [Robust CLIP: Unsupervised Adversarial Fine-Tuning of Vision Embeddings   for Robust Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12336)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Recent large vision-language models (VLMs) like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo show great promise on various vision-and-language tasks. However, they rely on a frozen CLIP vision encoder which makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks on images. Prior work has shown that imperceptible image perturbations can be used for targeted attacks to make the VLM output anything the attacker wants. This is concerning as it allows spreading fake information or defrauding users at scale. Thus making VLMs robust against such attacks is an important problem.

Proposed Solution:
The authors propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method called FARE to make the CLIP vision encoder robust. The key idea is to minimize the $\ell_2$ distance between original and fine-tuned CLIP embeddings to preserve the original features. This allows plugging in the robust CLIP encoder into downstream VLMs without needing to retrain them. Extensive experiments show that FARE leads to adversarially robust CLIP encoders while maintaining high clean performance on various tasks compared to prior robust CLIP models like TeCoA.

Key Contributions:
- Propose FARE, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme to make CLIP robust that preserves original features well
- Show ROS-CLIP encoders can be directly substituted in VLMs like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo making them robust without any VLM retraining
- Demonstrate high clean & robust performance on various vision-language tasks compared to prior robust CLIP (TeCoA) 
- Show that targeted imperceptible attacks no longer succeed against LLaVA when using robust CLIP from FARE
- Enable easy way to make VLMs robust against image attacks, facilitating their safe deployment

In summary, the paper makes VLMs robust to adversarial image perturbations via robustifying CLIP in an unsupervised way without hurting downstream performance. This is an important step towards safely deploying powerful but vulnerable VLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method called FARE to make the vision encoder of CLIP robust against adversarial attacks while preserving performance on clean images, allowing it to be used as a drop-in replacement in downstream vision-language models like OpenFlamingo and LLaVA to defend against adversarial attacks without needing to retrain them.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method called FARE to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder. The key ideas are:

1) FARE adversarially fine-tunes the CLIP vision encoder to make it robust to adversarial perturbations, while preserving the original CLIP embeddings on clean images. This allows replacing the original CLIP in downstream tasks like VLMs without needing to retrain them. 

2) Extensive experiments show that FARE-CLIP enables robustness of downstream tasks like VLMs and zero-shot classification against adversarial attacks, while maintaining high performance on clean images. This is in contrast to prior work like TeCoA that sacrifices significant clean accuracy for gains in robustness.

3) In particular, the authors show that using FARE-CLIP makes large VLMs like LLaVA and OpenFlamingo robust against imperceptible targeted attacks that could otherwise be exploited by malicious actors to spread misinformation or harm users.

So in summary, the main contribution is an unsupervised fine-tuning method to obtain a robust CLIP vision encoder that can be readily plugged into downstream models like VLMs to make them robust without sacrificing nominal performance.

The paper proposes an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method called FARE to make the CLIP vision encoder robust to adversarial attacks. The key idea is to preserve the original CLIP embeddings so that the fine-tuned robust CLIP model can readily replace the original CLIP in downstream tasks like VLMs without needing to retrain them. Experiments show the proposed FARE-CLIP maintains high clean performance while being robust to targeted and untargeted attacks compared to prior defense methods like TeCoA. The robustness also transfers to VLMs built using FARE-CLIP. Overall, the key focus is on improving adversarial robustness of CLIP and VLMs using CLIP in an unsupervised manner while preserving utility on clean inputs.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning scheme called FARE to make the vision encoder of CLIP robust. How is this method different from previous supervised approaches like TeCoA? What are the key benefits of an unsupervised approach?

2. The FARE loss function aims to minimize the embedding distortion for clean and adversarial examples compared to the original CLIP model. Explain the rationale behind this design and why it helps preserve performance on downstream tasks.  

3. The paper shows FARE is effective at different perturbation radii. What is the trade-off when fine-tuning at larger vs. smaller radii? How does the radius affect clean accuracy and robustness?

4. For the stealthy targeted attacks, the paper demonstrates complete robustness for models fine-tuned at epsilon=4/255 but some failures for epsilon=2/255. Analyze why this difference occurs and discuss how the radius affects robustness to such attacks.  

5. The paper evaluates FARE on multiple vision-language tasks besides just robustness metrics. Why is it important to assess performance on nominal inputs and tasks like captioning? How does FARE compare to TeCoA in this regard?

6. Error analysis: On tasks where FARE does not match the original CLIP's performance, what factors could be the cause? How can the approach be improved?

7. The paper focuses on securing the vision encoder. Discuss the limitations of this approach and why the text encoder also needs to be robustified for full VLM security.  

8. Analyze the trade-offs with short, efficient fine-tuning as done in this paper versus longer robust training. How do hyperparameters and epochs affect results?

9. Compare and contrast the transferability of adversarial examples for VLMs using different vision encoders. Why does FARE effectively stop such transfer attacks?

10. The paper proposes future work for applying FARE to other vision-language models besides CLIP-based ones. Analyze challenges and modifications needed to adapt the approach for other architectures.
