# [CICLe: Conformal In-Context Learning for Largescale Multi-Class Food   Risk Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11904)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Contaminated food poses serious health risks, but automatically detecting such risks from texts is challenging due to the noisy and high-dimensional nature of the data (thousands of classes).
- Existing datasets for food risk detection focus only on detection, not fine-grained categorization of hazards.

Dataset:
- The paper introduces the first dataset for large-scale multi-class text classification of food products and hazards, with labels on two levels of granularity (coarse and fine).
- The dataset contains 7,546 short texts describing food recall announcements, manually annotated by experts.

Methods:
- Various ML methods (naive, traditional ML, Transformer encoders) are benchmarked. A tf-idf + SVM classifier performs best overall.  
- Prompting GPT-3.5 directly is evaluated, showing strong performance from little data.
- A new prompting strategy, Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe), is proposed to boost performance of a base classifier via prompting, while reducing energy use.

Main Contributions:
1) First public dataset for fine-grained categorization of food hazards from texts 
2) Analysis showing traditional ML can outperform Transformers 
3) New prompting strategy to efficiently integrate an ML classifier with an LLM

The dataset advances the field by enabling more detailed food hazard categorization. The analysis highlights traditional ML viability for extreme multi-class classification. The CICLe prompting strategy contribution demonstrates an effective way to leverage LLMs to boost base classifiers.
