# [CICLe: Conformal In-Context Learning for Largescale Multi-Class Food   Risk Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11904)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Contaminated food poses serious health risks, but automatically detecting such risks from texts is challenging due to the noisy and high-dimensional nature of the data (thousands of classes).
- Existing datasets for food risk detection focus only on detection, not fine-grained categorization of hazards.

Dataset:
- The paper introduces the first dataset for large-scale multi-class text classification of food products and hazards, with labels on two levels of granularity (coarse and fine).
- The dataset contains 7,546 short texts describing food recall announcements, manually annotated by experts.

Methods:
- Various ML methods (naive, traditional ML, Transformer encoders) are benchmarked. A tf-idf + SVM classifier performs best overall.  
- Prompting GPT-3.5 directly is evaluated, showing strong performance from little data.
- A new prompting strategy, Conformal In-Context Learning (CICLe), is proposed to boost performance of a base classifier via prompting, while reducing energy use.

Main Contributions:
1) First public dataset for fine-grained categorization of food hazards from texts 
2) Analysis showing traditional ML can outperform Transformers 
3) New prompting strategy to efficiently integrate an ML classifier with an LLM

The dataset advances the field by enabling more detailed food hazard categorization. The analysis highlights traditional ML viability for extreme multi-class classification. The CICLe prompting strategy contribution demonstrates an effective way to leverage LLMs to boost base classifiers.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new dataset for multi-class text classification of food hazards and products, benchmarks several machine learning methods on it, and proposes a novel framework for efficient prompting of large language models using conformal prediction.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Presenting the first dataset for text classification of food products and food hazards on two levels of granularity (coarse and fine). The dataset contains 7,546 short texts describing food recall announcements, manually labeled for hazards and products.

2. Benchmarking various classifiers on the dataset, including naive, traditional machine learning, Transformer, and large language model classifiers. The analysis shows that traditional methods like Logistic Regression actually outperform RoBERTa and XLM-R on classes with low support.

3. Discussing different prompting strategies with large language models, and proposing a novel framework called "Conformal In-Context Learning" (CICLe). CICLe uses conformal prediction to boost the performance of a base classifier while reducing energy consumption compared to normal prompting.

So in summary, the key contributions are introducing a new dataset, benchmarking state-of-the-art models on it, and proposing a new prompting framework that can improve performance in a low-resource setting. The analysis also shows that traditional ML methods can still compete with large neural models on certain tasks.

 Based on my review, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- Food recall announcements dataset
- Multi-class text classification 
- Food products and hazards
- Coarse and fine-grained classification
- Logistic regression, SVM, transformer models
- Class imbalance

The paper introduces a new dataset of short texts from food recall announcements, with manual labels describing food products and hazards on two levels of granularity. Benchmark methods like LR, SVM and Transformers are tested, and class imbalance is a key challenge. Few-shot prompting of GPT-3.5 is also explored, with a proposed LLM-in-the-loop framework called CICLe that uses conformal prediction to boost performance. The key terms reflect this focus on multi-class classification, the dataset traits, models tested, and solutions for challenging data.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a new dataset for text classification of food products and hazards. What are some key advantages and limitations of this new dataset compared to existing food safety datasets?

2. The paper benchmarks several machine learning and deep learning models on the dataset. Why does the SVM model tend to outperform transformers like RoBERTa for low-support classes? 

3. The paper introduces a new prompting framework called CICLe that uses conformal prediction to select relevant classes for few-shot prompting. How does this approach balance accuracy and efficiency compared to other prompting strategies?

4. What role does the Î± parameter play in the CICLe framework? How does tuning this parameter allow trading off between LM and base classifier performance?

5. The CICLe prompting strategy relies on a base classifier to determine prediction certainty. How might the choice of base classifier impact overall performance of the CICLe prompt?

6. The paper identifies sample order and context length as two key factors influencing prompting performance. What further analyses could be done to better understand optimal configurations of these factors?  

7. What other prompting techniques, such as Chain of Thought, could potentially be integrated into the CICLe framework to further improve performance?

8. How well might the CICLe prompting strategy generalize to other large multi-class text classification datasets beyond this food safety domain?

9. What steps could be taken to further evaluate or improve the quality of the ground truth labels provided in the dataset?

10. The paper identifies some key limitations around noise and missing evidence in the dataset labels. How might these issues impact model training and evaluation? What could be done to account for this?
