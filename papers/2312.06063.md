## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel framework called PCRDiffusion that formulates point cloud registration as a denoising diffusion process from noisy transformation to object transformation. Specifically, it models the prediction of transformation parameters between two point clouds as a generation task using diffusion probabilistic models. During training, the model learns to reverse the diffusion process from ground truth transformation with added noise back to the original ground truth. At inference time, PCRDiffusion predicts the transformation by gradually refining an initial random transformation through multiple sampling steps. A key advantage of this approach is that it does not require iterative updates to the source point cloud to refine the predicted transformation. Experiments on both correspondence-based and correspondence-free scenarios demonstrate that PCRDiffusion achieves over 50% better performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on ModelNet40 and generalizes well to real-world datasets. The unified formulation through diffusion models and the inference efficiency brought by the non-iterative sampling process showcase the potential of applying diffusion models to discriminative tasks like point cloud registration.
