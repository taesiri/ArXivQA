# [Online Algorithmic Recourse by Collective Action](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00055)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem Statement:
The paper focuses on the problem of algorithmic recourse, where individuals seek to reverse unfavorable automated decisions made about them by machine learning models. Prior work has largely focused on the setting where the model parameters are fixed, and individuals perturb their own inputs to change the model's predictions. This paper instead considers the online setting, where the model parameters update over time as new data arrives. 

In this online setting, the paper explores new possibilities for "collective recourse", where groups coordinate perturbations to their own data in order to indirectly influence the model's behavior on separate "query subjects". As a motivating example, the paper discusses a hypothetical school assignment system that tends to segregate students from certain neighborhoods into lower-resourced schools. A group of students could coordinate misreporting their own features to change what the model learns over time, helping future students from their neighborhood get assigned to better schools.

Proposed Solution - Online Algorithmic Recourse (OAR):

The paper formalizes the idea of online collective recourse as a bilevel optimization problem called Online Algorithmic Recourse (OAR). The key components are:

- A model fÎ¸ that gets updated online according to a training dataset
- "Data subjects" who provide the training data 
- A "query subject" who wants the model to output a certain target prediction
- The data subjects make small feature perturbations to indirectly encourage, via the model update rule, the target prediction for the query subject

The paper shows how this collective action can actually enable more effective recourse than if the query subject perturbs their own input directly. This highlights the power in coordinating to violate the common i.i.d. assumption.

Main Contributions:

- Introduces the formal framework of Online Algorithmic Recourse (OAR) to model collective recourse in the online learning setting
- Shows empirically, in a simple proof-of-concept, that optimizing OAR can provide more effective recourse than individual input perturbation
- Discusses connections to related areas like data poisoning attacks and protective optimization
- Highlights the potential for collective action to enable forms of algorithmic recourse not possible with fixed models

The main insight is that by taking an online perspective, groups can leverage their participation in the model's training process to indirectly influence outcomes for others through coordinated action. This opens up new possibilities for recourse compared to viewing the model as static.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a framework called Online Algorithmic Recourse where groups of individuals can collectively influence machine learning model predictions on separate individuals by coordinating small perturbations to their own data which exploits the model's online parameter update rule.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a framework called Online Algorithmic Recourse (OAR) for examining recourse opportunities in the online setting where the model parameters update dynamically based on new data. Specifically, the paper shows that by taking a collective approach where groups of individuals coordinate their actions to influence the model updates, more effective recourse can be achieved compared to individuals perturbing their own data in isolation. The key insight is that by violating the i.i.d. assumption through coordinated action, groups can gain more leverage over model behavior. The paper presents experiments on simple classification tasks demonstrating that collective recourse outperforms individual recourse. Overall, the paper underscores the potential for collective action to enable more impactful forms of algorithmic recourse when model parameters update online.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Recourse - The paper focuses on algorithmic recourse, specifically recourse in an online setting where model parameters update over time. 

- Collective recourse - The paper examines a new form of recourse where groups of individuals coordinate perturbations to their data in order to influence model predictions about another individual. This is contrasted with typical individual recourse.

- Online algorithmic recourse (OAR) - The paper presents a framework called online algorithmic recourse for examining recourse opportunities in online, updating systems. 

- User agency - The ability for individuals and groups to influence model predictions and mitigate adverse decisions is related to promoting user agency.

- Model updates - The online setting considers models that update parameters over time as new data comes in, which enables new recourse opportunities. 

- Perturbations - Both individual and collective recourse work by carefully perturbing input data to influence model training and predictions.

- Collaboration/coordination - Collective recourse involves coordinating perturbations across a group of individuals to help another. 

So in summary, the key terms cover online recourse, collective action, perturbations, model updates over time, and user agency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper proposes a framework called "Online Algorithmic Recourse" (OAR). How is this framework different from traditional algorithmic recourse frameworks that focus on individual recourse against a fixed model? What new opportunities does the online setting provide?

2) The paper presents a concept called "collective recourse" where multiple data subjects coordinate perturbations to help a query subject. Explain this concept and how it allows the data subjects to violate the i.i.d. assumption to influence the model's behavior. 

3) The optimization problem for collective recourse (Eq. 3) contains a bi-level optimization formulation. Discuss the challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem and some potential approaches that could be explored.

4) The experimental section uses a simple nearest centroid model for empirical validation. Discuss the limitations of using such a simple model and how the framework could be extended to more complex and practical machine learning models. 

5) The experimental results demonstrate improved recourse through collective action compared to individual action. Critically analyze whether these results would hold in more realistic and high-stakes application settings.

6) The paper currently assumes white-box access to the model's loss function. How could the framework be extended to black-box attack settings more representative of real-world model APIs?

7) The related work section compares OAR to existing literature like data poisoning attacks and performative prediction. Elaborate on the key differences between OAR and these existing ideas.

8) The paper focuses exclusively on perturbing feature values for recourse. Could the OAR framework be combined with counterfactual explanations to generate more diverse and realistic recourse actions?

9) The discussion section mentions the role of labeling and potential coordination between crowd workers. Expand on how this could play an important role in determining model behavior and recourse.

10) The paper assumes a single step of parameter updates. How could the OAR framework be extended to account for multiple timesteps where users apply perturbations, observe effects, and further coordinate actions?
