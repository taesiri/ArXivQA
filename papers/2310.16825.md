# [CommonCanvas: An Open Diffusion Model Trained with Creative-Commons   Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16825)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

Is it possible to efficiently produce a high-quality text-to-image generative model by training only on Creative-Commons-licensed data?

The key elements of this research question are:

- Text-to-image (T2I) generative model: The type of model the researchers aim to train, specifically one that generates images from text captions/prompts.

- High-quality: The goal is to achieve competitive performance with other state-of-the-art T2I models like Stable Diffusion 2. 

- Creative-Commons-licensed data: The focus is on using openly licensed image data that does not have copyright restrictions, as opposed to other models trained on web-scraped or copyrighted data.

- Efficiently produce: There is a desire to develop efficient training methods and systems optimizations to make this feasible given the typically large datasets used to train such models.

So in summary, the main research question is examining if it's possible to train a high-quality text-to-image generative model using only Creative Commons image data in an efficient manner. The paper aims to address the challenges around limited openly licensed data and efficient training.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contribution of this paper is proposing and evaluating a method to train high-quality text-to-image generative models using only openly licensed, Creative Commons (CC) images. 

Specifically, the paper tackles two key challenges in using CC images to train text-to-image models:

1. Data incompleteness: CC images lack the captions needed to train text-to-image models. The paper proposes using a pre-trained image captioning model called BLIP-2 to generate synthetic captions for the CC images. 

2. Data scarcity: There are far fewer usable CC images compared to web-scraped datasets like LAION-2B. The paper shows that a variant of Stable Diffusion 2 can be trained to similar performance using only 3% as much training data as the original model. This suggests the 70 million CC images available are sufficient.

To summarize, the main contributions are:

- Proposing a method called "telephoning" to generate synthetic captions for CC images using a pre-trained captioning model.

- Creating a dataset called CommonCatalog with 70 million CC images and synthetic captions.

- Showing a text-to-image model called CommonCanvas can be trained on just 3% as much data as Stable Diffusion 2 yet achieve similar results.

- Releasing the CommonCatalog dataset and CommonCanvas models to the research community.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of training high-quality text-to-image models using only openly licensed data, addressing legal and ethical concerns around using web-scraped data. The proposed methods and released artifacts enable further research in this direction.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other related research:

- The paper presents a novel approach for training text-to-image generative models using only Creative Commons (CC) licensed images and synthetic captions. This is a unique contribution since most prior work relies on large datasets of copyrighted images scraped from the web, like LAION-2B. 

- The authors propose a technique called "telephoning" to generate synthetic captions for CC images using a pretrained captioning model. This allows them to create a paired image-text dataset for training without copyrighted data. The idea of using synthetic data to avoid copyright issues is novel and timely given recent lawsuits.

- The paper demonstrates that their model, CommonCanvas, can achieve strong qualitative results competitive with Stable Diffusion 2 despite using only 70 million CC images (vs 2 billion for SD2). This suggests generative models may not need as much data as previously thought. The data efficiency analysis is an interesting finding.

- The work also makes optimizations to substantially reduce SD2 training time and cost. This enables rapid iteration and experimentation. The systems-level contributions like Flash Attention are not conceptually novel but practically impactful.

- The authors frame the idea of using synthetic data as "telephoning", likening it to the game telephone where information changes form. Framing the general technique is a useful conceptual contribution applicable to other domains.

- The release of the CommonCatalog dataset and CommonCanvas models is a valuable contribution to the research community. This provides a benchmark for further studies on training generative models without copyrighted data.

Overall, I think the core ideas around using only CC data and synthetic captions are novel, as is the framing as "telephoning". The empirical findings around data efficiency and model quality are also interesting and challenge some assumptions. The systems optimizations and dataset/model release are practically impactful. The paper carves out a unique niche compared to related work focused on web-scraped copyrighted data.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper proposes several future research directions:

1. Extend the approach to other modalities besides images and text, such as audio, video, 3D shapes, etc. The concept of performing "lossy compression" via a pre-trained model could be applied to other types of data. 

2. Improve the quality and diversity of the generated captions. While BLIP-2 produced better captions than the original alt-text, there is still room for improvement. Exploring other captioning models or combining multiple models could help. Adding constraints during caption generation may also improve quality.

3. Scale up the training dataset size. The paper showed promising results with 70 million examples, but training on larger CC image datasets could further improve the models. 

4. Try larger T2I model architectures, like SD-XL. The paper demonstrated that larger models can better utilize the limited CC training data. Exploring optimal model size given constrained data is an interesting direction.

5. Address the issue of stale CC image data by incorporating more recent images from other sources. The YFCC100M images used are about a decade old.

6. Crowdsource human captions for some of the CC images to create a validation set with real ground truth captions. This could help better evaluate quality.

7. Apply similar techniques to create training datasets for other generative modeling domains like text, audio, video, etc. The idea of "lossy compression" via pre-trained models could apply broadly.

8. Better understand the trade-offs with synthetic data. For example, reduced diversity of captions improved privacy but hurt performance on certain measures.

9. Develop better metrics to evaluate differences between synthetic and human captions. Identifying gaps could guide improvements to synthetic captioning.

In summary, the main future directions are: scaling up data size and model capacity, improving synthetic captions, applying the approach to other data modalities, crowdsourcing human captions, and developing better evaluation methods for synthetic data.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method for training text-to-image generative models using only openly licensed, Creative Commons (CC) images. The two main challenges are the lack of captions for CC images, and the relative scarcity of high-resolution CC images compared to web-scraped datasets. To address the lack of captions, the authors use an intuitive transfer learning technique to generate synthetic captions for CC images using a pre-trained image captioning model. To deal with data scarcity, they implement optimizations to train the models more efficiently, and find that a model can be trained to similar performance as Stable Diffusion 2 using only 3% as much data. The authors assemble a dataset of 70 million CC images and synthetic captions which they use to train variants of the Stable Diffusion model. The resulting open source Common Canvas models achieve strong results, demonstrating the viability of training high-quality generative models without relying on potentially copyrighted web data.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new approach for training text-to-image generative models using only openly licensed Creative Commons (CC) images and synthetic captions. Generating high-quality images from text descriptions remains an active area of research in AI. However, most existing models rely on training data that may raise copyright concerns. The authors address this by curating a dataset of 70 million CC-licensed images and using a pre-trained captioning model to synthesize descriptive captions for these images. 

The key technical contribution is showing that strong text-to-image models can be trained with substantially less data than prior work. Through a combination of model architecture improvements and optimizations to the training process, the authors demonstrate that high image quality can be achieved using only 3% of the training data size previously thought necessary. They release all their code, data, and trained models openly. The resulting system, CommonCanvas, obtains promising results on benchmarks like COCO and PartiSet, even outperforming the proprietary Stable Diffusion v2 model in some cases. This helps address legal and ethical issues in AI while also making training more accessible. Overall, this work represents an important step towards developing capable and responsible text-to-image models.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a technique called "telephoning" to generate synthetic image captions for training text-to-image generative models on uncaptioned image datasets. The key idea is to use a pre-trained image captioning model to generate captions for a dataset of uncaptioned images. Specifically, they use the BLIP-2 captioning model trained on LAION-400M to generate captions for a dataset of 70 million Creative Commons licensed images called CommonCatalog. BLIP-2 performs a kind of "lossy compression", mapping images to short descriptive captions that lose specifics about the image content. These synthetic captions are then used along with the original images to train new text-to-image models like CommonCanvas. By using BLIP-2 as an intermediary to "compress" images into generic captions, the resulting CommonCanvas model avoids generating images that too closely match copyrighted source images while still producing reasonable images from text prompts.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my understanding, the key problem this paper is trying to address is how to train high-quality text-to-image (T2I) generative models using only open-licensed, Creative Commons (CC) image data, rather than web-scraped datasets that may have copyright issues. 

The two main challenges the paper identifies with using CC image data are:

1) Data incompleteness - CC images lack the captions/text descriptions needed to train T2I models. 

2) Data scarcity - There are relatively few high-resolution CC images publicly available (around 70 million) compared to web-scraped datasets (billions).

To address the data incompleteness issue, the authors propose using a pre-trained image captioning model (BLIP-2) to synthesize captions for the CC images. 

For the data scarcity issue, the authors implement optimizations to train the T2I models more efficiently, finding that they can match the quality of models trained on much larger web-scraped datasets with only 3% as much data.

The main contribution is showing it's possible to train high-quality generative T2I models using only openly licensed CC image data and synthesized captions. This provides a path forward for training such models that avoids the legal uncertainties around web scraping copyrighted data.

In summary, the key problem is training high-quality T2I models without using potentially copyrighted web-scraped data, and the solutions are using CC images plus synthesized captions, and highly optimized model training.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the abstract and introduction of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts seem to be:

- Stable Diffusion (SD) - A family of latent diffusion models for text-to-image generation. The SD2 model is trained on the LAION-2B dataset.

- LAION-2B - A large-scale web-scraped dataset of image-caption pairs used to train SD models. Raises issues of copyright and reproducibility. 

- Copyright - Legal concerns around training generative models like SD on datasets like LAION-2B that contain images and text scraped from the web without permission. 

- Reproducibility - Issues reproducing results trained on LAION-2B due to link rot and inability to redistribute original training data.

- Creative Commons (CC) - Images and media licensed in a way that expressly allows copying, distribution and adaptation, providing an alternative to copyrighted web data.

- Data scarcity - Relative lack of abundant curated CC image datasets compared to web-scraped sources.

- Data incompleteness - CC images rarely contain captions needed for text-to-image training.

- Synthetic captions - Using an image captioning model to generate synthetic/artificial captions for unlabeled CC images.

- Telephoning - Transfer learning technique to create synthetic training data by going from high-dimensional inputs to low-dimensional "lossy compression" and back.  

- CommonCanvas - Proposed suite of CC image + synthetic caption trained SD models.

In summary, key terms cover copyright issues with web training data, use of CC images as alternative, data scarcity and completeness challenges, synthetic captioning to enable CC image use, and the CommonCanvas models trained on this data.

## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 The paper trains open diffusion models on creative commons images and synthetic captions that achieve competitive performance to models trained on much larger datasets.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper presents an open diffusion model called CommonCanvas that is trained entirely on Creative Commons-licensed images and synthetic captions. The authors assemble a dataset of around 70 million high-resolution Creative Commons images from YFCC100M. Since most of these images lack captions, the authors use a pre-trained BLIP-2 model to generate synthetic captions via a technique they call "telephoning." They then train several latent diffusion model architectures called CommonCanvas on this dataset of images and synthetic captions. To enable faster iteration on model training, they implement optimizations like Flash Attention and reduced precision layers to achieve around 3x speedups. Through experiments, they find that their largest CommonCanvas model performs comparably to Stable Diffusion 2 on human evaluation, despite using less than 3% as much training data. This suggests diffusion models may be underparameterized. Overall, the authors demonstrate an approach to train a competitive open diffusion model using only openly licensed data and synthetic captions.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the paper:

1. The paper proposes using a pretrained BLIP-2 model to generate synthetic captions for unlabeled Creative Commons (CC) images. However, BLIP-2 was trained on a subset of LAION-400M, which contains copyrighted web-scraped images. Could using a model trained on copyrighted data to generate captions still raise legal concerns? How could the authors further demonstrate that the synthetic captions are sufficiently different from the original LAION-400M captions?

2. The paper finds that only ~3% of the LAION-2B dataset (around 70 million images) is needed to train their CommonCanvas models to achieve similar performance as SD2 baseline. However, the diversity and quality of generations may still suffer from the significantly reduced dataset size. How could the authors quantify the diversity and creativity of model outputs? Are there other metrics beyond automated ones like FID that could better evaluate sample quality?

3. The paper uses synthetic captions from BLIP-2 to train their models. However, BLIP-2 captions tend to lack diversity according to prior work. How does use of BLIP-2 captions impact the diversity of CommonCanvas model outputs? How could the authors modify the captioning approach to improve diversity?

4. The paper implements several optimizations like latent precomputation, reduced precision, and FSDP to achieve ~3x speedups in SD2 training. Could these optimizations improve sample efficiency and enable the CommonCanvas models to be trained with even less data? Was reduced precision training investigated with the CommonCanvas models?

5. The largest CommonCanvas model uses the SDXL architecture, which is much bigger than SD2's. Is the strong performance mainly due to the increased model capacity? How do the other CommonCanvas models with the smaller SD2 architecture perform in comparison? Are they still able to match SD2?

6. The paper focuses on training the unconditional models using CC image datasets. How difficult would it be to train a class-conditional model using the CC data? Would the synthetic captions provide enough signal? How would performance compare to LAION-trained class-conditional models?

7. The paper uses YFCC100M as the primary source of CC images. However, that dataset is quite old. Could the stale data impact model performance? What more recent sources of CC images could the authors incorporate in the future?

8. The paper uses automated metrics like FID for evaluation. However, FID biases towards the LAION style of data. Are there other metrics that could more fairly evaluate the CC trained models? How do human evaluations compare?

9. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of training high-quality generative models on CC data. However, CC images are still limited in diversity. How far can models trained purely on CC data be pushed in terms of scale and capability? What performance gaps still remain compared to LAION trained models?

10. The authors use a form of transfer learning to generate synthetic captions from CC images. Could other forms of transfer or self-supervised learning be used to further improve the captions? For example, perturbations or augmented data? How else could synthetic data generation help in training models with scarce data?


## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes \modelname, a suite of open text-to-image generative models trained only using Creative Commons licensed data and synthetic captions. The motivation is to avoid the copyright and reproduciblity issues with web-scraped datasets like LAION, while still producing high-quality models. The authors assemble a dataset of 70 million Creative Commons images from YFCC100M and use a pretrained BLIP-2 model to generate synthetic captions, producing the \datasetname dataset. To enable efficient training, they implement optimizations like Flash Attention and reduced-precision operations to achieve a 3X speedup in training Stable Diffusion 2. Surprisingly, they find that competitive image quality can be achieved with just 3% of the LAION-2B data by using a larger UNet architecture. Their largest \modelname model obtains comparable performance to Stable Diffusion 2 on human evaluation, despite the much smaller training set. The authors propose \captionmethod as a general technique for synthetic data augmentation by transferring labels between datasets via a pretrained model. Overall, this work demonstrates the viability of training high-quality open generative models on modest amounts of Creative Commons data, while avoiding copyright issues present in other datasets.
