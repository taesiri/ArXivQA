# [Evaluating Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Pretrained   Sentence Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14001)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Sentence embeddings from pretrained language models (PLMs) are high dimensional (1024-4096), causing issues for storage, computation time, and GPU memory usage in downstream tasks.  
- Need methods to reduce dimensionality without significantly sacrificing performance.

Proposed Solution:
- Evaluate unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods including PCA, SVD, KPCA, GRP, and Autoencoders.
- Methods are lightweight and can be applied as a post-processing step to precomputed sentence embeddings.
- Evaluate in inductive (only uses train sentences) and transductive (uses test sentences too) settings.
- Use 6 popular sentence encoders and evaluate on semantic textual similarity (STS-B), entailment prediction (SICK-E), and question classification (TREC) tasks.

Main Contributions:
- PCA consistently performs well across models and tasks, reducing dimensionality by ~50% with <1% performance loss.
- Surprisingly, reducing dimensionality further improves performance over original embeddings for some models.  
- PCA has fast training and inference compared to other methods.
- Results hold in both inductive and transductive settings.
- First systematic study evaluating unsupervised dimensionality reduction specifically for sentence embeddings from SOTA models.

In summary, the paper demonstrates PCA can effectively reduce the dimensionality of sentence embeddings from pretrained language models by up to 50%, without significantly impacting and sometimes even improving performance on downstream tasks. This enables the use of accurate high-dimensional sentence embeddings from PLMs in more memory and compute constrained scenarios.
