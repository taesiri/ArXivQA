# [Focus the Discrepancy: Intra- and Inter-Correlation Learning for Image   Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02983)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is how to develop an effective image anomaly detection method that can simultaneously model patch-wise representations and patch-to-patch correlations. Specifically, the authors argue that existing anomaly detection methods focus primarily on either patch-wise representation discrepancies or patch-to-patch feature distances, but not both. They hypothesize that combining these two complementary factors can lead to more robust anomaly detection, especially for complex anomaly types.To test this, they propose a new anomaly detection framework called FOcus-the-Discrepancy (FOD) which contains three main branches:- Patch-wise discrepancy branch for reconstructing patch features.- Intra-correlation branch for modeling patch correlations within an image.  - Inter-correlation branch for modeling correlations between image patches and external reference patterns.By jointly training these three branches, the model can spotlight anomalies based on patch-level discrepancies as well as weak intra- and inter-patch correlations.The central hypothesis is that modeling both factors will improve anomaly detection accuracy compared to methods that rely on just one. The paper presents experiments on real-world anomaly detection datasets that aim to validate this hypothesis.In summary, the key research question is how to effectively combine patch-wise and patch-correlation modeling for robust anomaly detection, which is addressed through the proposed FOD framework. The experiments then aim to demonstrate the benefits of this joint modeling approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:1. It proposes a new framework called FOcus-the-Discrepancy (FOD) for image anomaly detection. The key idea is to simultaneously model the patch-wise representation discrepancies as well as the intra- and inter-image correlations to better detect anomalies. 2. It introduces a novel Intra-Inter-Correlation (I2Correlation) module that explicitly models the intra-image and inter-image correlations using a two-branch Transformer structure. This allows capturing spatial context and semantic information that is complementary to patch-wise discrepancies.3. It proposes using radial basis function (RBF) kernels to construct target correlation distributions for self-supervised optimization of the intra- and inter-correlations. This provides adaptive correlation priors to guide the correlation learning.4. It introduces an entropy constraint mechanism during training to prevent mode collapse and amplify the distinguishability between normal and abnormal regions.5. Extensive experiments on MVTecAD, BTAD, and MVTecAD-3D datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in combining complementary cues for anomaly detection.In summary, the key novelty lies in effectively adapting Transformer's capability to model both representations and correlations for anomaly detection via the proposed I2Correlation module and optimization techniques. The results validate that combining patch-wise, intra-, and inter-discrepancies leads to better anomaly detection performance.
