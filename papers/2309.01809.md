# [Are Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models just In-Context   Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01809)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research questions addressed in this paper are:

1. Given the potential influence of in-context learning on the purported 'emergence' of various abilities in large language models (LLMs), which abilities are truly emergent in the absence of in-context learning, including instructional tuning?

2. Is there evidence for the emergence of 'reasoning' in instruction-tuned models? Or is it more likely that instruction tuning allows these models to more efficiently and effectively leverage in-context learning?

The key hypothesis is that the exceptional performance of LLMs on various tasks is primarily a consequence of their improved ability to utilize in-context learning, rather than indicating the emergence of reasoning skills or other advanced capabilities. The paper investigates this by evaluating models in the absence of in-context learning and comparing the performance of instruction-tuned vs non-instruction-tuned models.

So in summary, the central research questions focus on:

- Evaluating which abilities of LLMs are truly emergent when controlling for in-context learning 
- Determining if instruction tuning leads to reasoning abilities or just more efficient in-context learning

And the key hypothesis is that in-context learning, rather than reasoning, explains the abilities exhibited by LLMs. The experiments are designed to test this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is a comprehensive analysis of emergent abilities in large language models while accounting for potential biasing factors like in-context learning and instruction tuning. The key findings are:

- When controlling for in-context learning and instruction tuning, there is no evidence for the emergence of reasoning abilities or functional linguistic abilities in large language models. Only some formal linguistic abilities and memorization abilities emerge. 

- Instruction tuning likely allows models to more efficiently use their inherent in-context learning capabilities rather than leading to reasoning abilities. There is significant overlap between tasks solvable via instruction tuning and in-context learning.

- The paper advocates for evaluating emergent abilities in the absence of in-context learning and instruction tuning to get a more accurate measure of models' inherent capabilities.

- The lack of emergent reasoning abilities in large language models in the controlled experiments indicates these models do not harbour unpredictable latent capabilities, alleviating concerns about their safety.

Overall, the paper provides a rigorous analysis that aims to demystify the purported emergent abilities of large language models by accounting for confounding factors. The key conclusion is that these models do not exhibit emergent reasoning abilities when properly controlled for, which has important implications for their safe deployment.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 The paper empirically investigates the existence of emergent abilities in large language models by controlling for various factors like in-context learning and instruction tuning. The key finding is that most abilities previously considered emergent can be explained by models' effectiveness at leveraging in-context learning, with no evidence found for true emergent reasoning abilities.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other research on emergent abilities in large language models:

- This paper provides the first comprehensive examination of emergent abilities while accounting for various potentially biasing factors like in-context learning and instruction tuning. Other work has generally evaluated emergent abilities without controlling for these factors. 

- The paper uses a very rigorous experimental design, testing 18 models across over 1,000 experiments on 22 diverse tasks. This provides much more extensive evidence compared to prior work that has typically studied fewer models on a smaller set of tasks.

- The paper examines both the impact of removing in-context learning through zero-shot evaluation, and the interplay between in-context learning and instruction tuning. Other studies have not systematically isolated these different factors.

- The key finding that purported emergent reasoning abilities can be attributed to in-context learning challenges claims made in prior work about the emergence of reasoning in large language models. 

- The paper provides a new perspective compared to the only other study questioning emergent abilities, which argued the appearance of emergence stems from discrete evaluation metrics. This paper approaches it from the angle of in-context learning.

- Overall, this paper significantly advances the understanding of emergent abilities through its comprehensive and controlled experimental design. It provides compelling evidence that many purported abilities are not truly emergent, and offers a simpler explanation grounded in in-context learning. This has important implications for the field.

In summary, this paper represents a substantial advance in rigorously testing for emergent abilities in large language models while controlling for potential biases. The findings challenge claims made in prior work and offer critical new insights into the mechanisms underlying large language models' behaviors.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The authors suggest several future research directions:

- Further investigate the relationship between chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning/reasoning in LLMs. They plan to examine whether chain-of-thought prompting provides an effective way to leverage in-context learning for multi-step reasoning tasks. 

- Quantify in-context capabilities in LLMs and relate this to task complexity. The authors hypothesize that the number of emergent abilities increases with model scale because larger models have greater in-context abilities, analogous to needing more layers/parameters to solve certain tasks with ML models.

- Assess the influence of instruction tuning on diverse datasets when starting with models whose full training data is known. Currently this is limited by lack of transparency around commercial model training data. 

- Advocate for more transparency around model details like scale, pre-training data, and instruction tuning before release. This will enable more thorough analysis of abilities.

- Advocate for more analysis of task data itself, including quality, possible leaks, and abilities required (e.g. formal vs functional linguistic). 

- Design tasks to specifically test abilities that could lead to unexpected dangerous behaviors if unchecked. This is to thoroughly evaluate potential threats.

In summary, the main future work is around better understanding chain-of-thought prompting, quantifying in-context abilities, evaluating different instruction tuning datasets, increasing model transparency, thoroughly analyzing tasks/abilities, and designing tasks to uncover potential threats. The goals are to further demystify LLMs and ensure their safe utilization.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) by evaluating them in contexts designed to control for factors like in-context learning and instruction tuning. The authors hypothesize that most purported emergent reasoning abilities can be explained by models' effectiveness at in-context learning, rather than indicating true emergent cognition. They test models across a range of scales on 22 diverse tasks, carefully controlling the prompts to remove factors that could trigger in-context learning. Their results indicate that in the absence of in-context learning prompts, there is no evidence for emergent reasoning abilities in LLMs. The authors conclude that LLMs' abilities likely stem from a combination of formal linguistic competencies, information recall, and in-context learning efficiency, rather than genuine emergent cognition. They argue this finding has positive implications for LLM safety.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) while controlling for the influence of in-context learning and instruction tuning. The authors evaluate a range of models across different parameter sizes on 22 diverse reasoning tasks. They find that when evaluating models in a zero-shot setting without in-context examples, there is no evidence for emergent reasoning abilities. The only abilities that emerge are formal linguistic abilities and memorization. 

The paper argues that the exceptional performance of instruction-tuned models can be explained through their improved ability to leverage in-context learning, rather than the emergence of reasoning skills. The authors show substantial overlap between the tasks solvable by instruction-tuned models and those solvable by models capable of in-context learning. Overall, the paper provides evidence that reasoning abilities are not emergent in LLMs, and their abilities can be explained by formal linguistics, memory, and efficient use of in-context learning. This has implications for the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper conducts an extensive analysis of the emergent abilities of large language models (LLMs) by controlling for different factors that could influence performance, namely in-context learning, instruction tuning, and few-shot vs zero-shot evaluation. To do this, the authors test a range of models from different families (GPT, T5, Falcon, LLaMA) on 22 diverse reasoning tasks. They modify the prompts to avoid triggering in-context learning and evaluate non-instruction-tuned models in a zero-shot setting to isolate inherent abilities. Additional controls are used to mitigate biases, including flexible evaluation metrics like BERTScore, manual analysis of responses, and adversarial prompting. The results indicate that most purported emergent reasoning abilities can be explained by models' effectiveness at in-context learning rather than unpredictable emergence. Comparisons of instruction-tuned vs non-instruction-tuned models further suggest instruction tuning allows more efficient use of in-context abilities rather than conferring reasoning skills. Overall, the paper provides evidence that reasoning abilities are not emergent in LLMs when in-context learning is controlled for.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the following key questions:

1. Given the potential influence of in-context learning on the purported 'emergence' of various abilities in large language models (LLMs), which abilities are truly emergent in the absence of in-context learning, including instructional tuning?

2. Is there evidence for the emergence of 'reasoning' in instruction-tuned models? Or is it more likely that instruction tuning enables these models to more efficiently and effectively leverage in-context learning?

The paper is investigating whether many of the 'emergent' abilities that have been observed in large language models are actually just a result of models exploiting in-context learning or instruction tuning techniques, rather than being truly emergent abilities that arise unpredictably as models scale up. 

The authors question if emergent abilities actually exist when controlling for factors like in-context learning and instruction tuning. They also explore whether instruction tuning gives rise to reasoning abilities in models, or if it just allows them to better leverage in-context learning. Overall, the key problems are understanding what abilities are genuinely emergent versus just enhanced through techniques like in-context learning, and whether reasoning emerges or if improved task performance stems from better use of in-context abilities.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts include:

- Emergent abilities - The paper focuses on evaluating emergent abilities in large language models, which refers to capabilities that arise in large models but are not present or predictable in smaller models. 

- In-context learning - A key factor examined is the influence of in-context learning, where models are provided examples in the prompt, on purported emergent abilities. The paper aims to separate true emergent abilities from those arising due to in-context learning.

- Instruction tuning - The paper also examines the role of instruction tuning, where models are trained to follow instructions, and whether it leads to reasoning abilities or enables more efficient in-context learning. 

- Prompting techniques - The paper makes a distinction between emergent abilities and prompting techniques like in-context learning and instruction tuning that provide ways to leverage models but do not indicate latent abilities.

- Safety implications - The paper discusses safety implications of emergent abilities, specifically hazardous latent capabilities like reasoning and planning, versus predictable abilities like linguistic competencies. 

- Controlled evaluation - A key contribution is the extensive controlled evaluation of emergent abilities while accounting for factors like in-context learning that could create the appearance of emergence. 

- Lack of reasoning abilities - The main finding is that reasoning abilities do not emerge; the appearance of emergence can be attributed to prompting techniques and predictable linguistic competencies. This alleviates concerns about hazardous latent abilities.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. The paper argues that evaluating emergent abilities in large language models (LLMs) in the presence of in-context learning can be misleading. Why is it important to isolate the evaluation of emergent abilities from in-context learning? How does in-context learning confound the measurement of truly emergent abilities?

2. The authors advocate evaluating emergent abilities in LLMs using a zero-shot setting with models that are not instruction-tuned. What is the rationale behind this? Why is the zero-shot, non-instruction-tuned setting a more accurate approach for evaluating inherent abilities in LLMs?

3. The paper finds no evidence for reasoning abilities being emergent in LLMs when evaluated independently of in-context learning. However, the authors note that some prior work has identified certain reasoning tasks as emergent. How do you account for this discrepancy? What factors could lead to the appearance of reasoning ability emergence when in-context learning is not controlled for?

4. When assessing model performance, the authors use BERTScore in addition to exact match accuracy. What is the motivation behind using BERTScore? In what ways does it make the evaluation more robust and unbiased, especially for non-instruction-tuned models?

5. The prompt formats are modified in the paper to create "completion-style" prompts. Why is this done? How does it ensure that non-instruction-tuned models are evaluated fairly and are not disadvantaged in terms of their ability to comprehend task requirements?

6. Instruction tuning is found to likely trigger in-context learning in LLMs rather than directly imparting reasoning abilities. What evidence supports this conclusion? Why is it a more parsimonious explanation aligned with Occam's razor?

7. How do the authors account for potential biases like data leakage that could advantage larger LLMs and create the appearance of emergence? What steps are taken to mitigate such biases?

8. The paper argues that the abilities exhibited by LLMs can be explained by a combination of linguistic competence, memory, and in-context learning. Do you think this is a sufficient explanation? Are there any gaps that need to be addressed?

9. What are some ways the experimental design could be extended or improved in future work? For instance, how could you better match model sizes and use models with full training transparency?

10. What are the broader implications of these findings in terms of trust in LLMs and their safe deployment? How do these results help demystify LLMs and alleviate concerns about unpredictable latent capabilities?
