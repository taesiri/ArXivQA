# [PROSKILL: A formal skill language for acting in robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Acting is an important decision-making capability for autonomous robots to execute and oversee activities at runtime. It sits between planning and the robot's platform.
- Acting relies on skills to implement activities like plan refinement, recovery, dispatching, handling external events, etc.
- Skills are often programmed using ad-hoc languages and frameworks lacking support for verification and validation (V&V). 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new skill language called ProSkill to program robot acting skills. 
- ProSkill maps unambiguously to a formal framework called Fiacre which has clear semantics.  
- The Fiacre model can be used for both offline verification (using model checking) to prove properties, and online execution and runtime verification.

- ProSkill has basic primitives like state variables, events, basic skills (linking to robot commands) and composite skills (control structures).
- These ProSkill primitives are automatically translated to Fiacre processes and variables.
- The Fiacre model is compiled to a Time Transition System (TTS) which can be analyzed offline (using Tina tools) or executed online (using Hippo engine).

Main Contributions:
- A new acting skill language ProSkill which can be directly translated to a formal framework Fiacre
- Enables V&V for acting skills using offline model checking and online runtime verification
- Executes the formal model directly on the robot at runtime ensuring operational accuracy 
- Bridges the gap between acting skills programming and formal methods
- Requires no formal methods expertise from robotics programmers
- Demonstrated on a real drone performing an autonomous survey mission

The key value is that the same formal model can be verified offline and executed online on the robot for acting skills. This ensures consistency between programming, verification and execution.
