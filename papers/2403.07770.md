# [PROSKILL: A formal skill language for acting in robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07770)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Acting is an important decision-making capability for autonomous robots to execute and oversee activities at runtime. It sits between planning and the robot's platform.
- Acting relies on skills to implement activities like plan refinement, recovery, dispatching, handling external events, etc.
- Skills are often programmed using ad-hoc languages and frameworks lacking support for verification and validation (V&V). 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a new skill language called ProSkill to program robot acting skills. 
- ProSkill maps unambiguously to a formal framework called Fiacre which has clear semantics.  
- The Fiacre model can be used for both offline verification (using model checking) to prove properties, and online execution and runtime verification.

- ProSkill has basic primitives like state variables, events, basic skills (linking to robot commands) and composite skills (control structures).
- These ProSkill primitives are automatically translated to Fiacre processes and variables.
- The Fiacre model is compiled to a Time Transition System (TTS) which can be analyzed offline (using Tina tools) or executed online (using Hippo engine).

Main Contributions:
- A new acting skill language ProSkill which can be directly translated to a formal framework Fiacre
- Enables V&V for acting skills using offline model checking and online runtime verification
- Executes the formal model directly on the robot at runtime ensuring operational accuracy 
- Bridges the gap between acting skills programming and formal methods
- Requires no formal methods expertise from robotics programmers
- Demonstrated on a real drone performing an autonomous survey mission

The key value is that the same formal model can be verified offline and executed online on the robot for acting skills. This ensures consistency between programming, verification and execution.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents ProSkill, a new acting skill language for robots that can be automatically translated into a formal framework for offline verification and online execution.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a new skill language called ProSkill for programming the acting component of robots. The key aspects of ProSkill include:

- It can be automatically and unambiguously translated into the Fiacre formal framework. This allows ProSkill programs to be formally verified using model checking as well as executed at runtime for verification.

- The formal model obtained from a ProSkill program can be used both for offline verification to prove properties as well as online/runtime verification while executing on the robot. This helps bridge the gap between specification and execution.

- ProSkill aims to provide a range of necessary features for programming robotic skills related to calling commands, parallel execution, interrupts, timing constraints etc. while keeping the language simple.

- The goal is to make formal verification methods more accessible to roboticists by not requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying formal models like Fiacre. The translation is handled automatically.

So in summary, the main contribution is a robot skill language that facilitates formal verification for acting in robotics, usable by roboticists without needing deep expertise in formal methods.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords related to this paper include:

- Acting - The decision-making function to control and oversee the execution of activities on an autonomous system. A key concept in the paper.

- Skills - Models that specify how to perform actions as part of the acting functionality. The paper proposes a new skill language called ProSkill.

- Formal verification - Using mathematical techniques to prove properties and check for correct behavior in systems. A key focus of the paper is enabling formal verification of robot skills. 

- Model checking - A formal verification technique that exhaustively explores a system's state space to check if certain properties hold. Used in the offline verification of ProSkill programs.  

- Runtime verification - Checking if the execution of a system at runtime meets its formal specification. Enabled in the paper through translation to an executable Fiacre model.

- Fiacre - The formal modeling language that ProSkill skills are translated into in order to enable formal verification. Both an offline and online executable version are used.

- TINA - A toolbox for editing, simulating and analyzing Time Petri Nets, which is what Fiacre models compile down to. Used for offline verification. 

- Hippo - An execution engine for running Time Transition Systems obtained from executable Fiacre models. Allows runtime verification.

So in summary, key terms revolve around acting, skills, formal verification techniques, the Fiacre/TINA/Hippo framework, and forms of offline and online verification.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions I formulated about the method proposed in the paper:

1) The paper argues that providing a skill language whose equivalent formal model directly executes on the robot has several advantages. Can you elaborate on what those advantages are compared to other approaches? 

2) The paper proposes to use model checking for offline verification of skills programmed in ProSkill. However, model checking is known to suffer from state space explosion. What techniques could be used to mitigate this issue and make model checking of ProSkill programs more scalable?

3) The mapping of ProSkill constructs to Fiacre seems quite systematic and automatic. However, are there any ProSkill features that would be particularly difficult to map to Fiacre? If so, what is an example and why is it challenging? 

4) The paper claims that programming acting skills in ProSkill does not require formal methods knowledge. Do you think this fully holds up for more complex skills? When would a roboticist likely need to understand some formal methods concepts when programming in ProSkill?

5) Runtime verification is performed by executing the Fiacre model with the Hippo engine. What are the limitations of solely relying on the model execution to validate that the skills behave as intended? When could discrepancies occur between model and reality?

6) Could the concept of monitoring skills presented in the paper be utilized for runtime verification of complex safety properties? What would be required to encode more elaborate safety monitors?

7) The acting component interleaves planning and execution. The paper does not focus much on the planning aspect. Do you think the proposed approach could be utilized in synergy with a planner? If so, how?

8) Fiacre and Hippo originate from the real-time and embedded systems community. What adaptations were required to utilize this framework for robotic skill programming and verification?

9) The paper argues that having a unified language for specification and implementation closes the gap between modeling and programming robotic systems. Do you think this argument holds up well? What previous experiences support or contradict it?  

10) ProSkill focuses specifically on the acting component of robotic architectures. How difficult would it be to extend its principles more broadly to programming of perception, world modeling etc. or even complete robotic agents? What challenges need to be solved?
