# [A Lightweight Low-Light Image Enhancement Network via Channel Prior and   Gamma Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18147)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of images captured under poor, low-light conditions. Such images tend to have low contrast, high noise, and lack details. LLIE is challenging as it must restore lost information while preventing artifacts and noise amplification. Most existing LLIE methods rely on complex deep neural networks requiring extensive computational resources, limiting their applicability.  

Proposed Solution - CPGA-Net:
The paper proposes CPGA-Net, a lightweight convolutional neural network for efficient LLIE. CPGA-Net seamlessly integrates multiple traditional image enhancement techniques like dark/bright channel priors, luminance from YCbCr, and gamma correction into a streamlined CNN architecture inspired by the Atmospheric Scattering Model linking image dehazing and LLIE. 

The network contains two branches - a local branch that estimates transmittance using channel priors to restore information, and a global branch that performs gamma correction for brightness adjustment. An intersection-aware adaptive fusion module selectively combines outputs of the two branches, preventing training divergence. An efficient distilled version using guided filtering, CPGA-Net (DGF), is also presented.

Main Contributions:
- Combines traditional methods like channel priors and gamma correction with CNNs in a simplified architecture for LLIE 
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.025M parameters and 0.03s inference time
- Proposes CPGA-Net (DGF) version with 0.018M parameters and 0.006s inference time using knowledge distillation  
- Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate functionality of components and interpretability of technique
- Showcases synergy between traditional methods and deep learning for developing efficient LLIE techniques

The work provides an effective lightweight solution to LLIE and offers insights into designing efficient deep learning methods combining ideas across domains. The high performance, efficiency and interpretability make CPGA-Net suitable for applications on mobile and embedded systems.
