# [Improving Cross-modal Alignment with Synthetic Pairs for Text-only Image   Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08865)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes SynTIC, a novel text-only image captioning method that leverages synthetic image-text pairs to improve cross-modal alignment and unify training and inference. A text-to-image model generates synthetic images corresponding to training texts. The CLIP features of these synthetic images are optimized via a contrastive loss to resemble features of real images. Moreover, the optimized synthetic features are projected into the CLIP text embedding space by exploiting textual semantics, enhancing alignment and complementing image details. Additionally, object tags detected in the synthetic images provide auxiliary signals to the caption decoder. For inference, real-world images are encoded and projected in the same manner for decoding. Experiments show SynTIC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on in-domain, cross-domain, and zero-shot benchmark datasets. The use of synthetic pairs bridges modality gaps, enriches feature semantics, and unifies training/inference to achieve superior text-only image captioning.


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Most image captioning models rely on large datasets of image-text pairs, which are costly to acquire. Previous unsupervised methods leverage CLIP for text-only training, but suffer from: 1) the modality gap between CLIP embeddings of images and texts, and 2) discrepancy between training (text-only) and inference (images). These issues hinder cross-modal alignment.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes SynTIC - a method to improve cross-modal alignment using synthetic image-text pairs. Key ideas:

1) Use a text-to-image model to generate synthetic images from training texts. Refine their CLIP image features via contrastive loss to align them better with real images.  

2) Project refined synthetic image features into CLIP text space by taking a weighted combination of all text features. This enriches semantics and bridges modality gap.

3) Detect salient objects in synthetic images and use their CLIP text features as auxiliary input to the decoder. This further assists in alignment.

4) Unify training and inference by using synthetic pairs for training and projecting real image features the same way during inference.

Main Contributions:

- Proposes using synthetic pairs to improve cross-modal alignment in a text-only setting while unifying training and inference

- Develops a generation-then-refinement procedure to synthesize better aligned image representations 

- Shows state-of-the-art performance on MSCOCO, Flickr30K and SS1M datasets across in-domain, cross-domain and zero-shot settings

- Performs extensive ablations to demonstrate the utility of different components like feature optimization, projection and auxiliary objects

In summary, the key novelty is using synthetic pairs to enable text-only training while matching real image distributions better for superior generalization. The unified framework and components provide gains across diverse evaluation scenarios.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a text-only image captioning method called SynTIC that uses synthetic image-text pairs and detected objects to improve cross-modal alignment and unify training and inference.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A text-only image captioning method called SynTIC is proposed, which leverages synthetic data to improve modality alignment while unifying training and inference. 

2. A generation-then-refinement procedure is developed, including image feature optimization and projection, to better align images with texts. Object tags also serve as auxiliary points to enhance captioning performance.
