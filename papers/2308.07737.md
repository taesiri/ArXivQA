# [Identity-Consistent Aggregation for Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07737)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is how to enable video object detection (VID) models to focus on the identity-consistent temporal contexts of each object in order to obtain more comprehensive object representations. The key hypotheses are:1) Aggregating local views of the same object from different frames can facilitate a better understanding of the object and help the model handle rapid variations in object appearance.2) Existing VID models fail to do this effectively because they treat temporal contexts from different objects indiscriminately, ignoring object identities. 3) An identity-consistent temporal context aggregation (ICA) approach can be used to select and aggregate local views of each object across frames to obtain a more global representation of the object.4) Realizing ICA efficiently requires first reducing redundancies in existing VID models, which propose many redundant object candidates per frame. 5) A DETR-based model called ClipVID can enable efficient ICA while removing redundancies and making fast parallel predictions across frames.So in summary, the central research question is how to leverage identity-consistent temporal contexts to improve video object detection, with the key hypothesis that an ICA approach within an efficient DETR-based model can achieve this.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing a video object detection (VID) model called ClipVID that performs identity-consistent temporal context aggregation to enhance video object representations. Specifically:- It proposes an identity-consistent aggregation (ICA) approach to selectively aggregate temporal contexts from the same object identity across frames. This allows the model to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of each object to handle rapid appearance variations.- To enable efficient ICA, ClipVID is built on the DETR framework to remove redundancies in the object candidates. It also makes clip-wise parallel predictions to further improve efficiency. - ClipVID achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet VID while being significantly faster than prior works. For example, it obtains 84.7% mAP at 39 fps, which is ~7x faster than previous best methods.- Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed ICA module, especially for detecting fast-moving objects that suffer from heavy appearance changes. Visualization also shows ICA helps correct misclassifications and low-confidence predictions.In summary, the main contribution is proposing an identity-aware temporal aggregation approach via an efficient clip-based prediction framework, which advances the state-of-the-art in video object detection. The model achieves higher accuracy and faster speed simultaneously.
