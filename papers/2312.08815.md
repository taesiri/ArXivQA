# [Implement services for business scenarios by combining basic emulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08815)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces how the Jiutian Intelligence Network Simulation Platform combines multiple basic emulators to provide unified simulation services for complex business scenarios. Specifically, it describes three types of combination emulators: (1) real environment dynamic user protocol stack simulation, which simulates user behavior, base stations, and terminals; (2) real environment dynamic user coverage simulation, which focuses on physical layer simulation for efficiency; and (3) link-level channel simulation, which provides channel information. Use cases demonstrate applying these emulators, including multi-objective antenna optimization using reinforcement learning, high traffic prediction using machine learning, and CSI compression feedback optimization. Through emulator combination and interface encapsulation, the platform enables efficient simulation to support the integration of communications and AI across disciplines. Overall, this paper shows how the simulation platform composably leverages basic emulators to realize advanced simulation capabilities for diverse scenarios.
