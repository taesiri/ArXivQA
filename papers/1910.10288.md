# [Location-Relative Attention Mechanisms For Robust Long-Form Speech   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10288)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

How do different types of attention mechanisms compare in terms of alignment speed, consistency, naturalness, and ability to generalize to long utterances in text-to-speech synthesis systems?

The paper specifically compares content-based, hybrid location-sensitive, and purely location-relative attention mechanisms from two families - additive energy-based mechanisms and GMM-based mechanisms. The goal is to evaluate which type of attention mechanism works best for robust long-form speech synthesis.

The central hypothesis seems to be that purely location-relative attention mechanisms that do not rely on content-based query/key matching will align more quickly during training, be more consistent, achieve better naturalness on in-domain data, and generalize better to long utterances outside the training distribution compared to content-based or hybrid mechanisms.

In essence, the paper is evaluating different attention mechanism designs for end-to-end TTS to find the most effective one for producing natural, robust synthesis for long-form speech. The location-relative mechanisms are hypothesized to perform the best on these criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- A comparison of different attention mechanisms for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis in terms of alignment speed, consistency, naturalness, and ability to generalize to long utterances. 

- Introduction of two simple location-relative attention mechanisms that can align quickly and generalize well to long utterances:
   - A modified GMM attention mechanism (GMMv2b)
   - A new mechanism called Dynamic Convolution Attention (DCA)

- Demonstration that GMMv2b and DCA are able to synthesize natural speech for utterances much longer than seen during training (over 10x longer), while content-based and location-sensitive attention fail.

- Analysis showing GMMv2b and DCA align faster and more consistently during training compared to content-based and location-sensitive attention.

- Suggestion that location-relative mechanisms like GMMv2b and DCA should be considered more for monotonic alignment tasks like TTS where they have advantages over content-based mechanisms.

In summary, the main contribution is an analysis and demonstration of simple location-relative attention mechanisms that can align quickly and generalize TTS synthesis to very long utterances.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper compares different types of attention mechanisms for text-to-speech systems, finding that location-relative mechanisms like Gaussian mixture model attention and a proposed dynamic convolution attention are best able to produce natural-sounding speech for long utterances.
