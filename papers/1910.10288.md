# [Location-Relative Attention Mechanisms For Robust Long-Form Speech   Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10288)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question is:

How do different types of attention mechanisms compare in terms of alignment speed, consistency, naturalness, and ability to generalize to long utterances in text-to-speech synthesis systems?

The paper specifically compares content-based, hybrid location-sensitive, and purely location-relative attention mechanisms from two families - additive energy-based mechanisms and GMM-based mechanisms. The goal is to evaluate which type of attention mechanism works best for robust long-form speech synthesis.

The central hypothesis seems to be that purely location-relative attention mechanisms that do not rely on content-based query/key matching will align more quickly during training, be more consistent, achieve better naturalness on in-domain data, and generalize better to long utterances outside the training distribution compared to content-based or hybrid mechanisms.

In essence, the paper is evaluating different attention mechanism designs for end-to-end TTS to find the most effective one for producing natural, robust synthesis for long-form speech. The location-relative mechanisms are hypothesized to perform the best on these criteria.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- A comparison of different attention mechanisms for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis in terms of alignment speed, consistency, naturalness, and ability to generalize to long utterances. 

- Introduction of two simple location-relative attention mechanisms that can align quickly and generalize well to long utterances:
   - A modified GMM attention mechanism (GMMv2b)
   - A new mechanism called Dynamic Convolution Attention (DCA)

- Demonstration that GMMv2b and DCA are able to synthesize natural speech for utterances much longer than seen during training (over 10x longer), while content-based and location-sensitive attention fail.

- Analysis showing GMMv2b and DCA align faster and more consistently during training compared to content-based and location-sensitive attention.

- Suggestion that location-relative mechanisms like GMMv2b and DCA should be considered more for monotonic alignment tasks like TTS where they have advantages over content-based mechanisms.

In summary, the main contribution is an analysis and demonstration of simple location-relative attention mechanisms that can align quickly and generalize TTS synthesis to very long utterances.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the paper:

The paper compares different types of attention mechanisms for text-to-speech systems, finding that location-relative mechanisms like Gaussian mixture model attention and a proposed dynamic convolution attention are best able to produce natural-sounding speech for long utterances.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key ways this paper compares to other research on attention mechanisms for text-to-speech synthesis:

- It systematically compares different types of attention mechanisms (content-based, location-based, hybrid) in terms of alignment speed/consistency, naturalness, and ability to generalize. Many other papers focus on just one proposed mechanism.

- It shows that purely location-based mechanisms like the GMM attention and the proposed Dynamic Convolution Attention can generalize to much longer utterances than seen during training, while maintaining naturalness on short utterances. Other papers have not demonstrated generalization to such long utterances.

- It proposes modifications to standard GMM attention to improve training stability. It also proposes the new Dynamic Convolution Attention, which combines strengths of both location-based and hybrid mechanisms.

- It demonstrates the robustness issues with standard content-based and hybrid attention mechanisms when generalizing to longer utterances. Other papers using these mechanisms don't always evaluate on long utterances.

- It uses simple, efficient attention mechanisms that don't require dynamic programming for marginalization during training. Some other proposed monotonic attention mechanisms rely on more complex recursive computation.

- It focuses on text-to-speech, while a lot of seminal attention research focuses on machine translation. The findings are relevant but not always directly applicable to TTS.

In summary, this paper provides a rigorous comparison of attention options for TTS and shows the promise of purely location-based mechanisms. The proposed enhancements to standard approaches are simple but yield good improvements to stability and generalization ability.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Exploring other types of location-relative attention mechanisms beyond GMM and dynamic convolution attention. The authors showed these two mechanisms work well, but there may be other effective location-relative approaches.

- Applying location-relative attention to other sequence-to-sequence problems like machine translation or speech recognition where monotonic alignment is useful. The authors demonstrated benefits for TTS, but the mechanisms could generalize. 

- Optimizing the prior parameters in dynamic convolution attention for different datasets/languages. Using priors tailored to each dataset's phoneme rate could further optimize alignment speed.

- Incorporating hard windowing optimizations into location-relative attention implementations for efficiency. The authors note DCA may be better suited for this compared to GMM attention.

- Evaluating location-relative attention on very long-form tasks like synthesizing audiobooks. The ability to handle long utterances could enable new applications.

- Exploring the effect of alignment speed on model quality. The authors observe slower alignment can hurt quality, so investigating this relationship could improve results.

In summary, the main future directions relate to exploring new location-relative mechanisms, applying the concepts to other tasks, optimizing the methods, and evaluating on long-form synthesis tasks. The results so far suggest promise for location-relative attention in various sequence-to-sequence problems.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper compares different attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models. It focuses on location-relative attention mechanisms that exploit the monotonic alignment between input text and output speech. The authors compare Gaussian mixture model (GMM) attention and additive energy-based attention on metrics like alignment speed, consistency, naturalness, and ability to generalize to long utterances.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper compares different attention mechanisms for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. The authors focus on location-relative attention mechanisms that align the input text and output speech based on their relative positions, rather than relying on content-based comparisons. They compare two families of attention mechanisms - Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based and additive energy-based. The GMM mechanisms model attention as a mixture of Gaussians centered around monotonic offsets. The energy-based mechanisms use an MLP to compute attention energies that are converted to probabilities. 

The authors introduce modifications to make GMM attention align faster and more consistently during training. They also propose a new energy-based mechanism called dynamic convolution attention (DCA) that uses dynamic and static convolutional filters to make the alignment location-relative while remaining fully normalized. Experiments show that both GMM and DCA are able to align quickly and generalize to synthesize very long utterances outside the training distribution, while also achieving naturalness on short in-domain utterances. The authors conclude that location-relative mechanisms are advantageous for TTS and other monotonic sequence-to-sequence tasks like speech recognition.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper compares different attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models. It focuses on comparing content-based attention (which attends based on query-key matching) versus purely location-based attention mechanisms. The main method proposed is called Dynamic Convolution Attention (DCA), which is a normalized, monotonic attention mechanism based on the hybrid location-sensitive attention in Tacotron 2. DCA removes the content-based terms and adds dynamic filters that are computed from the RNN state, as well as a learned prior filter that encourages monotonicity. Experiments show that DCA and a modified version of Graves' GMM attention are able to align quickly during training and generalize to synthesize much longer utterances compared to content-based and location-sensitive attention. The main conclusion is that simple location-relative attention mechanisms work very well for TTS synthesis and other monotonic sequence alignment tasks.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the issue of attention failures in end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on sequence-to-sequence models with attention. Specifically, it focuses on improving the alignment robustness and ability to synthesize long utterances.

The key points are:

- Attention-based TTS systems like Tacotron can produce very natural speech but suffer from attention failures, especially on long or out-of-domain utterances. This leads to errors like repeating or missing words.

- The commonly used content-based and hybrid location-sensitive attention mechanisms are prone to these failures.

- The paper proposes using simple location-relative attention mechanisms instead, which align based only on position and not content. 

- Two location-relative families are compared: Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) attention and a new Dynamic Convolutional Attention (DCA).

- Experiments show GMM and DCA align faster and more robustly during training. They can also synthesize much longer utterances without failures, while retaining naturalness on shorter in-domain speech.

In summary, the paper demonstrates location-relative attention as a way to improve alignment stability and enable long-form TTS synthesis. DCA and GMM attention are shown to be effective choices.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the paper:

This paper compares different types of attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis models. The two main families of attention mechanisms examined are GMM-based mechanisms, which are purely location-based, and additive energy-based mechanisms like the content-based and location-sensitive attentions used in Tacotron 1 and 2. The authors introduce modifications to GMM attention to improve training stability and propose a new location-relative attention called Dynamic Convolution Attention (DCA). Experiments show that DCA and modified GMM attention align quickly and robustly during training and can generate very long utterances at test time, unlike content-based attention. DCA has the additional benefits of producing normalized attention weights and more easily limiting the attention window. Overall, the results demonstrate the advantages of location-relative attention mechanisms like DCA and modified GMM for monotonic alignment tasks like TTS. These simple mechanisms align quickly, synthesize natural sounding speech for short in-domain utterances, and generalize to significantly longer utterances compared to content-based attention.
