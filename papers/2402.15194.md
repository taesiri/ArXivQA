# [Fine-Tuning of Continuous-Time Diffusion Models as Entropy-Regularized   Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15194)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Diffusion models can effectively capture complex data distributions, but often the goal is to fine-tune them to optimize some reward function (e.g. image aesthetic quality). 
- Naively fine-tuning to maximize rewards leads to issues like reduced diversity, deviation from original data distribution, and poor sample quality due to exploitability of imperfect reward functions. 
- These issues are collectively called "reward collapse" and pose a major obstacle.

Proposed Solution:
- Frame the fine-tuning problem as entropy-regularized control against the pretrained diffusion model using neural SDEs.
- Introduce a loss combining terminal reward and entropy regularization w.r.t. both drift term and initial distribution.
- The entropy regularization term maintains bridges (posterior distributions) of pretrained model to avoid deviating too much.

Main Contributions:
- Present theoretical and empirical evidence that the proposed framework generates diverse samples with high rewards, while mitigating overoptimization of imperfect rewards.
- Demonstrate superior performance to KL-penalized RL baseline in image generation and biological sequence generation.
- Introduce novel techniques like learning optimal initial distribution via second control problem and using Feynman-Kac formulation to learn value function.
- Establish desirable properties for fine-tuning like high reward, diversity, and proximity to original data distribution.

In summary, the paper proposes an entropy-regularized control framework for fine-tuning diffusion models that generates high-reward and diverse samples while avoiding common issues like reward collapse. Both theoretical and empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
