# [Dynamic Knowledge Injection for AIXI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16184)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of the paper:

Problem: 
Prior approximations of AIXI, a theoretically optimal Bayesian reinforcement learning agent, are limited to using a fixed, pre-defined set of environment models. This introduces an irreducible source of approximation error and model bias that prevents AIXI-approximations from fully recovering the optimality properties of AIXI. In particular, environment models initially provided to the agent may be inadequate or biased.

Proposed Solution:
The paper introduces a new reinforcement learning agent called DynamicHedgeAIXI that operates in a dynamic knowledge injection setting. In this setting, a human operator can provide the agent with additional environment models over time that augment and improve upon the initial set of models provided. 

DynamicHedgeAIXI maintains a Bayesian mixture over the dynamically provided sets of models. The mixture distribution uses a novel, adaptive Bayesian prior derived from the Hedge online learning algorithm. This allows new models to be incorporated in an online manner whilst ensuring good convergence guarantees.

Whenever the human operator provides a new model, DynamicHedgeAIXI incorporates it into the mixture whilst removing the existing model that currently has the lowest weight (which indicates it is the worst performing model). This allows the agent to focus its representation on the best available models provided so far.

Main Contributions:
- Formalization of the dynamic knowledge injection setting for reinforcement learning agents where environment models arrive online over the agent's lifetime
- Introduction of DynamicHedgeAIXI, the first AIXI-approximation agent capable of dynamic knowledge injection whilst maintaining an exact Bayesian mixture over models
- An adaptive prior scheme based on the Hedge algorithm that controls how new models are integrated into the mixture 
- Strong theoretical results bounding DynamicHedgeAIXI's value convergence rates against the best sequence of models seen so far
- Empirical validation of DynamicHedgeAIXI showing improved adaptation capabilities compared to non-dynamic AIXI agents

The dynamic knowledge injection setting moves us closer towards more collaborative and symbiotic partnerships between humans and AI agents. The proposed DynamicHedgeAIXI agent bridges theory and practice to this end.
