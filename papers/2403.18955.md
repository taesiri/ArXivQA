# [Structurally Prune Anything: Any Architecture, Any Framework, Any Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18955)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
The paper identifies three main challenges in neural network pruning:

1) Difficulty in applying structured pruning methods to diverse model architectures due to the need to manage interdependencies between coupled channels. Existing methods rely heavily on case-by-case analysis.

2) Lack of unified frameworks that support pruning at any stage - before, during or after training. Most works focus only on the train-prune-finetune setting.  

3) Framework specificity of pruning methods due to differences in computational graphs, layer definitions and APIs across frameworks. This complicates general applicability.

Proposed Solution: \ours{} (\oursacro{})

Main contributions:

1) Prune Any Framework: Uses ONNX for framework-agnostic representation and pruning. First method to handle major DL frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet, JAX).

2) Prune Any Architecture: Proposes 4-step procedure for automatic structured pruning - coupling channels, grouping, importance estimation and pruning. Supports diverse CNN and Transformer architectures. 

3) Prune Any Time: Group-level importance estimation enables pruning before, during or after training. Proposes Optimal Brain SPA (OBSPA) - SOTA pruning without fine-tuning or calibration data.

Key Details:

- Uses flexible computational graph (vs. dependency graph) for operator relationships and mask propagation to detect coupled channels

- Groups coupled channels and estimates importance scores for pruning entire groups

- Conversion between ONNX and PyTorch provides framework-independence and gradient computation

- OBSPA extends OBC unstructured pruning to structured, leveraging layer-wise Hessian for data-free pruning

The experiments demonstrate SOTA results across architectures, frameworks and training paradigms. The method is also faster than prior art.
