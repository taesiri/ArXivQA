# [TrojViT: Trojan Insertion in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How to perform an effective backdoor attack on Vision Transformers (ViTs) by generating Trojans that can force the model to misclassify inputs with a trigger to a target label, while maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs?

Specifically, the paper aims to develop a ViT-specific backdoor attack called TrojViT that can:

- Generate a stealthy patch-wise trigger optimized to hijack the attention of critical patches in ViTs. This is different from prior area-wise triggers designed for CNNs.

- Insert an efficient Trojan into a ViT model by flipping minimal bits of parameters using a tuned parameter distillation technique.

- Achieve high attack success rate on inputs with the trigger, while maintaining high clean data accuracy on benign inputs.

The central hypothesis is that by designing triggers and Trojan insertion tailored for ViTs, it is possible to launch more effective backdoor attacks on ViTs compared to naively applying CNN-based backdoor methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical evaluations of TrojViT.

In summary, the paper focuses on investigating backdoor attacks specifically catered to abuse the attention mechanism and patch-wise processing of Vision Transformers, in order to highlight the security vulnerabilities of ViTs against such attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing TrojViT, a novel backdoor attack specifically designed for Vision Transformers (ViTs). 

- Introducing a patch-wise trigger generation method that identifies critical patches in images using patch salience ranking. This allows the trigger to absorb more attention from the ViT model compared to prior area-wise triggers.

- Presenting an Attention-Target loss function to optimize the patch-wise trigger. This loss considers both maximizing attention to the trigger patches and improving attack success rate for a target class. 

- Using a tuned parameter distillation technique to minimize the number of weight bits modified during Trojan insertion into the ViT. This makes the attack more practical and stealthy.

- Performing comprehensive experiments on multiple ViT models and datasets. Results show TrojViT can achieve high attack success rates of 99%+ while modifying only a few hundred weight bits out of millions in the ViT.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel patch-wise trigger generation method and Trojan insertion technique tailored for ViTs. This allows highly effective backdoor attacks on ViTs with minimal model corruption.
