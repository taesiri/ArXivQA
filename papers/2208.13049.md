# [TrojViT: Trojan Insertion in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: 

How to perform an effective backdoor attack on Vision Transformers (ViTs) by generating Trojans that can force the model to misclassify inputs with a trigger to a target label, while maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs?

Specifically, the paper aims to develop a ViT-specific backdoor attack called TrojViT that can:

- Generate a stealthy patch-wise trigger optimized to hijack the attention of critical patches in ViTs. This is different from prior area-wise triggers designed for CNNs.

- Insert an efficient Trojan into a ViT model by flipping minimal bits of parameters using a tuned parameter distillation technique.

- Achieve high attack success rate on inputs with the trigger, while maintaining high clean data accuracy on benign inputs.

The central hypothesis is that by designing triggers and Trojan insertion tailored for ViTs, it is possible to launch more effective backdoor attacks on ViTs compared to naively applying CNN-based backdoor methods. The paper aims to demonstrate this through empirical evaluations of TrojViT.

In summary, the paper focuses on investigating backdoor attacks specifically catered to abuse the attention mechanism and patch-wise processing of Vision Transformers, in order to highlight the security vulnerabilities of ViTs against such attacks.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

- Proposing TrojViT, a novel backdoor attack specifically designed for Vision Transformers (ViTs). 

- Introducing a patch-wise trigger generation method that identifies critical patches in images using patch salience ranking. This allows the trigger to absorb more attention from the ViT model compared to prior area-wise triggers.

- Presenting an Attention-Target loss function to optimize the patch-wise trigger. This loss considers both maximizing attention to the trigger patches and improving attack success rate for a target class. 

- Using a tuned parameter distillation technique to minimize the number of weight bits modified during Trojan insertion into the ViT. This makes the attack more practical and stealthy.

- Performing comprehensive experiments on multiple ViT models and datasets. Results show TrojViT can achieve high attack success rates of 99%+ while modifying only a few hundred weight bits out of millions in the ViT.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing a novel patch-wise trigger generation method and Trojan insertion technique tailored for ViTs. This allows highly effective backdoor attacks on ViTs with minimal model corruption.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes TrojViT, a novel patch-wise backdoor attack technique tailored for Vision Transformers that uses patch salience ranking, attention-target loss, and parameter distillation to stealthily insert hardware trojans into ViT models via minimal bit flips and induce misclassification on inputs with triggers while maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work on backdoor attacks against vision transformers (ViTs):

- Threat Model: The threat model of TrojViT is similar to prior work on backdoor attacks against CNNs, such as TBT and ProFlip. It does not require access to the original training data or full retraining, making it more practical than some other ViT backdoor attacks like DBIA, BAVT, and DBAVT.

- Trigger Type: Unlike prior ViT backdoor attacks that use area-based triggers, TrojViT proposes a patch-wise trigger specifically designed for ViTs. This allows it to achieve higher attack efficacy with smaller trigger sizes.

- Attack Methodology: TrojViT introduces novel techniques like patch salience ranking, attention-target loss, and parameter distillation tailored for ViTs. These lead to improved attack success rates, smaller degradation in clean accuracy, and more efficient Trojan insertion compared to prior arts.

- Evaluation: The paper provides extensive evaluations on multiple models (DeiT, ViT, Swin Transformer) and datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNet). The results demonstrate TrojViT's superior attack performance over prior ViT backdoors.

- Defense: The paper discusses why existing ViT backdoor defenses may fail against TrojViT and proposes a potential defense technique involving weight matrix decomposition. This highlights the need for new defenses specifically designed for patch-wise backdoors.

Overall, TrojViT presents an in-depth exploration of backdoor attacks tailored to ViTs. The novel attack methodology and comprehensive evaluations advance the understanding of ViT security compared to prior work focused on CNNs or naive application of CNN attacks to ViTs. The results reveal the need to rethink defenses against this new class of patch-wise backdoor threats.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 The paper suggests the following future research directions:

- Exploring different trigger generation strategies beyond the patch-wise trigger used in TrojViT. The authors mention that integrating semantic information into the trigger design could further improve attack effectiveness. 

- Studying Trojan attacks on other vision transformer models besides ViT, DeiT and Swin Transformer. As new transformer architectures emerge, evaluating their vulnerability is an important direction.

- Developing more robust defenses against Trojan attacks on vision transformers. The authors propose a simple defense technique in the paper but mention more advanced defense methods need to be explored.

- Conducting physical demonstrations of the TrojViT attack using real-world Rowhammer bit flips. The current results are based on simulated bit flips. Validating the attack with actual hardware faults would be impactful. 

- Analyzing the effects of different quantization schemes on the proposed attack. The paper uses 8-bit quantization but lower precision like 4-bit quantization could affect attack success rates.

- Extending TrojViT to other modalities beyond images, such as video, point cloud, and audio transformers. Assessing cross-modality transferability is an interesting problem.

In summary, the main future directions are designing improved triggers, evaluating new transformer models, developing robust defenses, physical attack demonstrations, analyzing quantization impacts, and extending the attack to other modalities. The paper provides a solid foundation for continued research on Trojan attacks against vision transformers.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes TrojViT, a novel backdoor attack technique targeted specifically at Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike prior backdoor attacks designed for CNNs that use area-wise triggers, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger to effectively attack a ViT model. It identifies critical patches using patch salience ranking and optimizes the trigger using an Attention-Target loss to absorb attention and force misclassification. TrojViT also utilizes a tuned parameter distillation technique to minimize the number of bit flips required in the victim model to insert the Trojan. Experiments demonstrate TrojViT can achieve high attack success rates on multiple ViTs and datasets with minimal impact on clean input accuracy and using very few bit flips (e.g. 345 bit flips to attack a ViT on ImageNet). The paper also discusses a potential defense approach by decomposing critical weight matrices to increase attack overhead. Overall, TrojViT is a stealthy and efficient backdoor attack technique tailored specifically for Vision Transformers.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

This paper proposes TrojViT, a novel backdoor attack to induce a predefined misbehavior in Vision Transformer (ViT) models by corrupting inputs and model weights. Unlike prior work using area-wise triggers designed for CNNs, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger for ViTs. The patch-wise trigger is composed of multiple pieces, with each piece embedded into a critical patch of the input image identified through patch salience ranking. An Attention-Target loss function trains the trigger generation to achieve two objectives: make each piece of the trigger gain more attention, and maximize the attack success rate for a target class. TrojViT also uses a tuned parameter distillation technique to minimize the number of flipped bits needed to insert the Trojan into the ViT model weights. 

Experiments demonstrate TrojViT's effectiveness and stealthiness in attacking various ViT models on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For example, on ImageNet TrojViT achieves 99.64% attack success rate while flipping only 345 bits (of 22 million) in a ViT model. Comparisons to prior work show TrojViT requires 10,000x fewer bit flips than a state-of-the-art ViT backdoor attack, with higher clean accuracy and attack success rate. The paper also discusses a potential defense approach by decomposing critical weight matrices to increase the attack overhead. Overall, TrojViT represents an efficient and stealthy backdoor attack customized for ViTs.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 The paper proposes TrojViT, a novel backdoor attack method targeting Vision Transformers (ViTs). The key ideas are:

1. It generates a patch-wise trigger rather than an area-wise trigger used in prior CNN backdoor attacks. The patch-wise trigger is more effective for ViTs as it can highlight critical patches that the model pays attention to. 

2. It uses patch salience ranking to identify the most critical patches in the input image to attach trigger pieces. 

3. It trains the trigger using an Attention-Target loss that optimizes both attention scores and attack success rate on a target class. 

4. It inserts the Trojan into the ViT model using a tuned parameter distillation technique to minimize the number of bit flips needed, improving stealthiness. 

In summary, TrojViT generates a stealthy patch-wise trigger optimized using attention and target objectives, and efficiently inserts the Trojan into a ViT model by flipping a minimal set of critical bits identified through tuned parameter distillation. Experiments show it can achieve high attack success rates with negligible accuracy loss on clean images.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of backdoor attacks on Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, it aims to develop an effective and stealthy backdoor attack method tailored for ViTs.

The key questions the paper tries to address are:

- How to generate an effective trigger pattern that can induce the desired misclassification behavior in ViTs? Previous triggers designed for CNNs do not work well for ViTs.

- How to insert the backdoor Trojan into a ViT model efficiently with minimal parameter modification? Naively modifying ViT parameters significantly degrades accuracy on clean inputs. 

- How to make the attack stealthy by using a small trigger pattern and minimizing the number of modified parameters?

So in summary, the main problem is creating an effective backdoor attack specially designed for ViTs, which can induce misclassification on triggered inputs while maintaining accuracy on clean inputs and being stealthy. The paper proposes a method called TrojViT to address this problem.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes TrojViT, a novel and practical backdoor attack specifically designed to target Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike prior works that use area-based triggers, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger by ranking the salience of patches and optimizing an attention-target loss function. This allows TrojViT to induce misclassification to a target label by modifying only a small number of bits in the ViT model via the RowHammer technique. The attack is shown to be highly effective, achieving over 99% attack success rate on ImageNet while preserving the accuracy on clean images, using 345 bit flips out of 22 million parameters. The patch-based trigger optimized for ViT attention makes TrojViT more stealthy and efficient than prior backdoor attacks on CNNs and ViTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrojViT poses a serious threat to the security of Vision Transformers in real-world applications. The authors also discuss potential defenses against such ViT backdoor attacks.
