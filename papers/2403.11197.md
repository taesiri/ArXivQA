# [TAG: Guidance-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11197)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Traditional semantic segmentation methods have significant limitations including the need for dense pixel-level annotations, extensive training, and inability to detect new/rare classes outside a predefined set. 
- Unsupervised and open-vocabulary segmentation methods attempted to address these issues but still face challenges like inability to assign class labels to clusters (unsupervised) and requirement of text guidance from users (open-vocabulary).

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes a novel method called TAG (Training, Annotation and Guidance-free open vocabulary semantic segmentation) to address the above limitations. 
- TAG utilizes pre-trained CLIP and DINO models to extract pixel-level features and segment images without additional training or dense annotations.
- It identifies segment candidates using DINO features, gets representative embeddings for each segment using CLIP, and assigns segment categories by retrieving closest matching sentences from an external database.

Main Contributions:
- TAG achieves compelling semantic segmentation performance without training, dense annotations or text guidance from users.
- It outperforms previous state-of-the-art in zero-guidance segmentation by 15.3 mIoU on PascalVOC dataset.
- The use of an external database provides flexibility to add new concepts without retraining the model.
- Experiments demonstrate TAG's capability to accurately handle diverse categories including general objects as well as fine-grained proper nouns.

In summary, the paper proposes a novel training, annotation and guidance-free open vocabulary semantic segmentation method called TAG that leverages pre-trained models and an external database to achieve compelling performance as well as flexibility. Key advantages include eliminating training/annotations and outperforming prior arts in zero-guidance segmentation tasks.
