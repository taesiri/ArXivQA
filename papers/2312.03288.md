# [STEP CATFormer: Spatial-Temporal Effective Body-Part Cross Attention   Transformer for Skeleton-based Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03288)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a novel spatial-temporal effective body-part cross-attention transformer network (STEP-CATFormer) for skeleton-based action recognition for applications like gaming play. It takes advantage of inherent relationships between joints and body parts of the skeleton in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In the spatial dimension, it learns joint and body-part correlations by adaptively sampling discriminative joint body-part relationships, capturing informative spatial dependencies. In the temporal dimension, it learns dynamic temporal relations explicitly using a dilation convolution transformer to capture rich motion patterns effectively. The model consists of feature extractor, temporal fusion, and STEP-CATFormer branches. The STEP-CATFormer branch has several sub-components that model spatial (single and multi body-part cross attentions) and temporal (super dynamic temporal attention) features. The model is evaluated on the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 skeleton datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance thanks to its ability to model spatial and temporal relationships within the skeleton structure. Thus, it has strong potential for skeleton-based action recognition applications requiring accurate real-time understanding of body movements like gaming.
