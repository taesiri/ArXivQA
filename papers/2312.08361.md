# [Distributed Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Language Models Over The   Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08361)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel fault-tolerant algorithm and decentralized system called Petals for performing efficient inference and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) over distributed unreliable devices connected through the internet. Petals allows pooling together idle consumer-grade compute resources like GPUs across labs and volunteers to run the largest publicly available LLMs like BLOOM (176B params) much more efficiently than using offloading or other strategies. The system uses a dual attention caching strategy and automatic load balancing to provide correct outputs despite failures and heterogeneous hardware. Evaluations demonstrate Petals can achieve over 10x faster inference compared to offloading baselines by exploiting even low-bandwidth internet connections thanks to the extreme model parallelism. Additional contributions include supporting beam search and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches like adapter tuning within the decentralized architecture. Limitations around privacy and security are discussed along with ideas to mitigate them through incentives, validators, and redundant inference. Overall, Petals offers a practical way to democratize access to cutting edge LLMs among researchers through collaborative compute.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant algorithm and decentralized system for efficient inference and fine-tuning of large language models over networks of unreliable consumer-grade devices.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel fault-tolerant algorithm for inferencing large language models on distributed unreliable devices connected over the Internet. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can inference LLMs with 50B+ parameters in this setup.

2. The development of \textsc{Petals} - a decentralized system for inferencing and fine-tuning LLMs over the Internet. The system allows users to run inference and fine-tuning over a swarm of unreliable devices with the same correctness guarantees as when running locally. 

3. Benchmarks of the proposed algorithms on Llama 2 (70B) and BLOOM (176B). Experiments show the system performs autoregressive generation ≥10× faster than local offloading in realistic network conditions.

4. Evaluations of the system performance in controlled conditions with simulated network latency and server failures, and in a real-world geo-distributed setup spanning two continents.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel fault-tolerant distributed algorithm and system to enable cost-efficient inference and fine-tuning of very large language models, using consumer-grade hardware pooled over the Internet.
