# [Distributed Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Language Models Over The   Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08361)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a detailed paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper introduces a novel fault-tolerant algorithm and decentralized system called Petals for performing efficient inference and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) over distributed unreliable devices connected through the internet. Petals allows pooling together idle consumer-grade compute resources like GPUs across labs and volunteers to run the largest publicly available LLMs like BLOOM (176B params) much more efficiently than using offloading or other strategies. The system uses a dual attention caching strategy and automatic load balancing to provide correct outputs despite failures and heterogeneous hardware. Evaluations demonstrate Petals can achieve over 10x faster inference compared to offloading baselines by exploiting even low-bandwidth internet connections thanks to the extreme model parallelism. Additional contributions include supporting beam search and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches like adapter tuning within the decentralized architecture. Limitations around privacy and security are discussed along with ideas to mitigate them through incentives, validators, and redundant inference. Overall, Petals offers a practical way to democratize access to cutting edge LLMs among researchers through collaborative compute.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have proven very useful for NLP tasks. However, running inference and fine-tuning on these large models requires specialized high-end hardware that is inaccessible to most researchers. Existing solutions like offloading parameters from GPU memory to RAM/SSD are inefficient for interactive applications. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant algorithm and system for distributing inference and fine-tuning of LLMs over many unreliable and heterogeneous devices connected over the internet. The system allows pooling idle GPU resources from different labs and volunteers to run large models collaboratively.

The algorithm uses a pipelined model parallel approach, with each device holding a subset of model layers. It maintains dual attention caches on both servers and client to quickly recover from failures. The servers measure their own capabilities and use a decentralized load balancing protocol to automatically assign model layers, maximizing total system throughput. Fine-tuning only updates a small set of client-side parameters, simplifying coordination.

Main Contributions:
1) A fault-tolerant inference algorithm that can efficiently run LLMs over distributed unreliable devices, using dual caches to recover from failures.

2) Petals - a decentralized system implementation that pools idle Internet-connected GPU resources to run large language models. It automatically handles load balancing, fault recovery, client coordination.

3) Quantitative evaluations showing the system can achieve 10x higher throughput over offloading baselines when running inference for Llama-70B and BLOOM-176B. Experiments use real-world geo-distributed servers on two continents.

4) Support for efficient decentralized fine-tuning of LLMs using parameter-efficient methods like adapters while keeping most model parameters fixed on servers.

In summary, the paper enables running state-of-the-art LLMs on consumer hardware by distributing computation over many volunteers, with novel algorithms to handle unreliability and coordination.
