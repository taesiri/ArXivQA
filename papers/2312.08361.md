# [Distributed Inference and Fine-tuning of Large Language Models Over The   Internet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08361)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have proven very useful for NLP tasks. However, running inference and fine-tuning on these large models requires specialized high-end hardware that is inaccessible to most researchers. Existing solutions like offloading parameters from GPU memory to RAM/SSD are inefficient for interactive applications. 

Proposed Solution: 
The paper proposes a novel fault-tolerant algorithm and system for distributing inference and fine-tuning of LLMs over many unreliable and heterogeneous devices connected over the internet. The system allows pooling idle GPU resources from different labs and volunteers to run large models collaboratively.

The algorithm uses a pipelined model parallel approach, with each device holding a subset of model layers. It maintains dual attention caches on both servers and client to quickly recover from failures. The servers measure their own capabilities and use a decentralized load balancing protocol to automatically assign model layers, maximizing total system throughput. Fine-tuning only updates a small set of client-side parameters, simplifying coordination.

Main Contributions:
1) A fault-tolerant inference algorithm that can efficiently run LLMs over distributed unreliable devices, using dual caches to recover from failures.

2) Petals - a decentralized system implementation that pools idle Internet-connected GPU resources to run large language models. It automatically handles load balancing, fault recovery, client coordination.

3) Quantitative evaluations showing the system can achieve 10x higher throughput over offloading baselines when running inference for Llama-70B and BLOOM-176B. Experiments use real-world geo-distributed servers on two continents.

4) Support for efficient decentralized fine-tuning of LLMs using parameter-efficient methods like adapters while keeping most model parameters fixed on servers.

In summary, the paper enables running state-of-the-art LLMs on consumer hardware by distributing computation over many volunteers, with novel algorithms to handle unreliability and coordination.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a decentralized system that enables reliable inference and fine-tuning of large language models over distributed unreliable devices connected via the Internet by using novel fault-tolerant algorithms and load balancing protocols.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A novel fault-tolerant algorithm for inferencing large language models on distributed unreliable devices connected over the Internet. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm that can inference LLMs with 50B+ parameters in this setup.

2. The development of Petals - a decentralized system for inferencing and fine-tuning LLMs over the Internet. The system allows users to run inference and fine-tuning over a swarm of unreliable devices with the same correctness guarantees as when running locally. 

3. Benchmarks of the proposed algorithms on Llama 2 (70B) and BLOOM (176B), in both controlled conditions (with simulated network latency and server failures) and in a real-world geo-distributed system spanning two continents. The distributed algorithms achieve ≥10x faster autoregressive generation compared to local offloading in realistic network speeds.

In summary, the main contribution is a novel decentralized algorithm and system to enable cost-efficient inference and fine-tuning of very large language models, by distributing computation over many unreliable and heterogeneous devices. This allows leveraging idle consumer GPUs over the Internet to run models that would normally require specialized high-end hardware.
