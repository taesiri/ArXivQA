# [(Beyond) Reasonable Doubt: Challenges that Public Defenders Face in   Scrutinizing AI in Court](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13004)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper studies the challenges that public defenders in the U.S. face when scrutinizing and contesting the reliability of computational forensic software (CFS) used by the government to convict and incarcerate people. CFS refers to automated decision systems like facial recognition, gunshot detection, and probabilistic genotyping tools. Making such systems contestable is important for accountability, but there may be practical barriers. 

The paper focuses specifically on public defenders, who represent indigent defendants and have a duty to rigorously scrutinize evidence used against their clients. The research question is: What challenges do public defenders face when scrutinizing the government's use of automated decision systems like facial recognition and probabilistic genotyping software in the criminal legal system?

Proposed Solution and Methods:
The authors conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with public defenders and others working with them on technology issues in criminal cases. They asked about experiences with and challenges in assessing/contesting CFS reliability.

Key Findings:
Public defenders faced 3 main challenges:

1) Navigating CFS developers/users - Actions limited defenders' ability to assess reliability, e.g. insufficient testing/documentation, withdrawing evidence when scrutinized.  

2) Overcoming judges/jurors' non-critical perceptions of CFS - Their prior beliefs, deference to prosecutors, and difficulties understanding technology led to uncritical views of CFS.

3) Gathering CFS expertise - Defenders relied heavily on outside experts to help scrutinize CFS, but faced difficulties finding available experts willing to work with the defense. Building internal expertise is costly and infeasible for most offices.

Implications:
More work is needed to ensure performance evaluations effectively support contestability. This includes:
1) Considering external factors that constrain opportunities for scrutiny
2) Contextualizing evaluation design in real-world use cases 
3) Understanding how factors like deliberation, presentation complexity and prior beliefs shape interpretations of performance.

In summary, the paper reveals a range of technical, social and institutional barriers that public defenders face in assessing CFS reliability, and highlights areas for future work to better position performance evaluations to support contestability in practice.
