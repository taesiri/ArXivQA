## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML):- This paper provides a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of the state-of-the-art in AutoML research. Many other papers focus on a specific aspect of AutoML such as neural architecture search or hyperparameter optimization. This paper covers the full spectrum of AutoML techniques.- The paper categorizes AutoML techniques into meta-learning, neural architecture search, hyperparameter optimization, and tools/frameworks. This provides a structured way to understand the broad AutoML landscape. Other surveys do not organize the content in this manner.- The paper discusses both centralized and distributed/scalable AutoML frameworks. Some other surveys focus only on one type of framework. Covering both provides a more complete picture.- The paper highlights open challenges and future directions for AutoML research. Identifying open problems is useful for guiding subsequent research efforts. Not all surveys discuss open issues in this detail.- Compared to some other surveys, this paper covers more recent progress in AutoML, including techniques from 2018-2019. However, it does not cover some of the very latest advances since its publication.Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive, structured, and fairly up-to-date survey of AutoML research. Its broad taxonomy and coverage of open problems make it a useful overview and reference for researchers interested in understanding the state of AutoML. It compares well to other surveys, with its comprehensiveness and identification of open challenges being particular strengths.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key future research directions suggested by the authors include:- Improving scalability of AutoML systems to handle large datasets using distributed and parallel computation frameworks. The current centralized AutoML systems have limitations in handling large datasets.- Advancing optimization techniques for hyperparameter tuning and neural architecture search, as there is no single best method. More research is needed to make AutoML systems adaptively select optimization strategies based on dataset characteristics. - Automatically determining optimal time budgets for AutoML search to balance tradeoffs between search time and result quality.- Enabling better composability between different ML platforms like centralized systems (Weka, Scikit-Learn etc.) and distributed systems (Spark, Mahout etc.) to build high-quality pipelines.- Improving user-friendliness through interactive interfaces to make AutoML accessible to non-experts. - Research on automating other parts of the ML pipeline like data validation, preparation, model deployment and management.- Integrating AutoML systems into continuous delivery pipelines with testing and validation.- Advancing meta-learning techniques to improve search space pruning and warm-starting optimization.- Evaluating AutoML systems through challenges and competitions to develop metrics and benchmarks.In summary, the key open challenges highlighted are around scaling AutoML to big data, advancing optimization and search techniques, improving composability, user-friendliness and expanding automation to the full ML lifecycle beyond just modeling.
