# [Harmonizing Global Voices: Culturally-Aware Models for Enhanced Content   Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02401)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Content moderation at scale faces challenges in considering local cultural contexts when assessing potentially inappropriate content. Global platforms often use standardized rules that overlook regional variations in interpreting content.

Proposed Solution:
- Develop culturally attuned language models by fine-tuning them on news articles and content moderation data from different regions. These models aim to capture nuances in communication and cultural norms across geographies. 

- Use the culturally attuned models for two tasks: 1) identifying content violations, and 2) generating explanations for violation decisions that align with local cultural sensitivities.

Key Contributions:
- Show that relying solely on global models for content moderation overlooks important cultural differences in interpreting content. Culturally adapted models lead to improved performance.

- Propose a comprehensive methodology to imbue language models with cultural awareness using region-specific news articles and content moderation data.

- Evaluate culturally attuned models on content violation detection and explanation tasks. Find that aligned models achieve higher accuracy within their intended culture.

- Explore model-generated explanations for content violations. Aligned models produce rationales preferred by local experts over misaligned models. 

- Overall, demonstrate the value of culturally aware models in enhancing content moderation and the ability to provide aligned explanations. Underscore need for adaptable systems that consider diverse cultural norms.
