# [Harmonizing Global Voices: Culturally-Aware Models for Enhanced Content   Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02401)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method to make content moderation systems more culturally aware by training language models on extensive datasets of local news articles and content moderation examples to capture regional variations in interpreting content. The culturally attuned models are evaluated on two tasks - identifying content violations and generating explanations for violations. Experiments show that models trained on local data perform better at detecting violations originating from that region compared to models trained on other regions. Additionally, human evaluation indicates that explanations generated by culturally aligned models are often preferred by local experts over non-aligned models. The results demonstrate that incorporating cultural knowledge through localized training data enables models to better align with diverse cultural norms and improve performance on critical moderation tasks like policy violation detection and explanation. Overall, the paper highlights the need for adaptable and context-aware AI systems for ethical and effective global content oversight.
