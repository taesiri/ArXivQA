# [Reconstructing Animatable Categories from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06351)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:

How can we build animatable 3D models of deformable object categories from monocular videos while disentangling variations across instances from time-specific variations within an instance?

The key challenges they aim to address are:

1) Modeling the morphological variation across instances within a category (e.g. different dog breeds). This is difficult to disentangle from time-varying variations within a single instance (e.g. a dog's articulation and deformation over time).

2) Dealing with the limited and impoverished nature of in-the-wild videos, where objects may be partially observable from limited viewpoints and with inaccurate segmentation masks. The model needs to listen to common structures across the category while staying faithful to the input views. 

Their proposed approach RAC introduces three main ideas to address these challenges:

1) Specializing skeletons to instances via optimization, allowing better disentanglement of morphology and articulation.

2) A method for latent space regularization that encourages shared structure across the category while maintaining instance details.

3) Using 3D background models to disentangle objects from the background.

The overall goal is to learn category-level 3D models from monocular videos that can generate different instances and their motions, without requiring 3D supervision or registrations.

In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of building animatable category-level 3D models from in-the-wild monocular videos, while disentangling variations across instances and motions over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper presents Reconstructing Animatable Categories from Videos (RAC), a method to build animatable 3D models of object categories from monocular video collections. The key contributions are:

1. Learning category-level shape and skeleton models from videos without 3D supervision. This allows capturing variations across instances within a category (e.g. different dog breeds).

2. Disentangling between-instance morphological variations from within-instance pose and motion over time. This allows motion transfer across instances. 

3. Modeling the background scene as a 3D NeRF to improve object segmentation.

4. Achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on humans, dogs and cats using only 50-100 casual internet videos per category.

The main novelty is building category-level models without 3D supervision that can disentangle shape, appearance and motion variations across a category. This is enabled by optimizing instance-specific skeletons and shape codes, regularizing the shape space, and modeling the background. The results show the potential to scale articulated 3D reconstruction to new categories from in-the-wild videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper presents RAC, a method to reconstruct animatable 3D models of deformable object categories like cats, dogs, and humans from monocular videos by disentangling variations across instances (e.g. morphology) from variations within instances over time (e.g. articulations), enabling motion transfer across instances in a category.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:

- The paper focuses on reconstructing 3D animatable models of deformable object categories (e.g. cats, dogs, humans) from monocular videos. This is in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on reconstructing single object instances or rigid objects. 

- The method disentangles between-instance variations (different shapes/appearances within a category) from within-instance variations (articulations and deformations over time) in the 3D model. This allows for applications like motion retargeting across instances. Many prior methods do not explicitly disentangle these factors.

- The approach uses only monocular videos for supervision and does not rely on 3D scans, templates, or other strong priors like parametric models. This makes it more scalable to new categories compared to model-based methods.

- A key contribution is the use of category-level background models to improve segmentation and handle partial views. This differs from prior video-based reconstruction methods that ignore the background.

- The method specializes skeletons to instances via optimization rather than manual rigging. It also allows bone lengths to change between instances to capture shape differences.

- Compared to other video-based reconstruction methods like BANMo and NeRF-based category modeling, this approach achieves state-of-the-art results on humans, dogs and cats by effectively combining ideas like conditional fields, skeleton-based deformation, and background modeling.

In summary, the main advances are in disentangling factors of variation, handling partial views, and reconstructing finer details of non-rigid categories from monocular videos alone. The experiments demonstrate these contributions lead to high quality animatable category models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:

- Improving the robustness and generalization ability of the camera viewpoint initialization. The current method requires rough viewpoint initialization either from a pre-trained network or manual annotation. Developing approaches that are more robust to diverse in-the-wild videos could be an interesting direction.

- Jointly inferring the skeleton structure and topology along with the object shape, rather than using a predefined skeleton. This could allow the method to handle categories and motions where the ideal skeleton structure is unknown.

- Incorporating a more detailed and accurate 3D background model, rather than just using it for segmentation. This could further improve foreground object reconstruction.

- Extending the method to model more fine-grained details like facial expressions, hand articulation, etc. The current approach focuses more on overall body shape and motion. 

- Exploring other ways to regularize the latent spaces, beyond code swapping, to encourage disentanglement and generalization over the category.

- Applying the technique to model more object categories beyond humans, dogs and cats. Testing the limits of the method on more diverse categories could reveal areas for improvement.

- Combining the approach with parametric models like SMPL to take advantage of their robustness while still allowing for in-the-wild training data.

- Improving runtime performance to make the method more practical for real applications.

In summary, potential future work could focus on improving robustness, generalization, detail, scalability, and efficiency of the method. The disentangled category-level modeling is a promising direction with many opportunities for follow-up research.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper presents RAC, a method for reconstructing animatable 3D models of object categories like cats, dogs, and humans from monocular videos. The key ideas are: (1) Specializing a category-level skeleton to instances via optimization to disentangle morphological variations across instances from articulation variations within instances. (2) Regularizing the latent shape space to encourage coherence across the category while remaining faithful to input views using a novel code-swapping technique. (3) Using background 3D models to improve segmentation masks. 

RAC represents morphological variations with a conditional canonical implicit field that captures fine shape details and a stretchable skeleton model that controls coarse dimensions. Time-varying articulation is modeled with linear blend skinning in dual quaternion space. Additional non-skeleton deformations are modeled using a learned neural deformation field. The parameters are optimized end-to-end using differentiable rendering on silhouette, color, flow and feature reconstruction losses. Experiments show RAC can build animatable models of cats, dogs and humans from 50-100 videos that outperform recent methods. The disentangled shape and motion spaces enable applications like motion retargeting across instances.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper presents RAC, a method to reconstruct animatable 3D models of deformable object categories like cats, dogs, and humans from monocular videos. The key ideas are: (1) Model the variations across instances in a category using a morphology code to represent differences in shape, texture, and skeleton dimensions. (2) Disentangle the within-instance variations over time into skeletal motion and non-rigid deformation. This is done using a linear blend skinning model based on a category-level skeleton and a neural deformation field. (3) Use a background scene model to improve segmentation and handling of partial views. These components are optimized end-to-end using differentiable rendering on a collection of Internet videos to produce an animatable category-level model that can generate new instances and motions. The method is shown to perform well on cats, dogs, and humans using 50-100 videos without 3D supervision.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 From my reading, the key points of this paper are:

- The paper aims to build animatable 3D models of deformable object categories (e.g. cats, dogs, humans) from monocular videos. This is challenging because it requires disentangling variations across instances (e.g. different dog breeds) from variations within an instance over time (e.g. a dog's motions). 

- Most prior work focuses on reconstructing single rigid objects or known deformable categories like humans. This paper wants to tackle more diverse categories without relying on 3D supervision or manual registration.

- The key ideas proposed are:
   - Specializing a skeleton to each instance via optimization.
   - Regularizing the unobserved parts to be consistent across the category while remaining faithful to observed views. 
   - Using a category-level background model to improve object segmentation.

- Experiments show they can build animatable models of cats, dogs and humans from 50-100 internet videos that outperform prior arts. The disentangled representations allow motion transfer across instances.

In summary, the key problem is learning a category-level model that disentangles shape variations across instances from articulations within an instance, using only monocular videos without strong shape priors. The proposed method combines instance-specific skeletons, inter-instance regularization, and background modeling to address this.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about method proposed in this paper and avoid simple question.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper introduces three key ideas to solve the problem of reconstructing animatable 3D models from monocular videos: specializing a skeleton to instances via optimization, a method for latent space regularization to encourage shared structure while maintaining instance details, and using 3D background models to disentangle objects from the background. Can you explain in more detail how each of these ideas helps address the challenges outlined in the introduction? 

2. The method represents between-instance shape variations using a conditional canonical field and stretchable bone model. What are the advantages of this hierarchical representation over using something like dense warping fields? How does it allow the model to capture both fine-grained and coarse shape variations?

3. The paper proposes a novel technique for regularizing the morphology code using code swapping between videos during optimization. How does this encourage the model to learn a shared latent space? Why is this more effective than just using a norm regularization as in a VAE?

4. The skeletal motion is modeled using dual quaternion blend skinning. What are the advantages of this technique over linear blend skinning? How does it reduce artifacts in the resulting animations?

5. The non-rigid deformations are modeled using a neural deformation field based on real-NVP. Why is it important to incorporate this on top of the skeletal motion model? What kinds of deformations can this represent that the skeleton alone cannot?

6. The method incorporates invertible warping between the posed and canonical spaces. Why is invertibility useful here? How does it help enable capabilities like motion retargeting demonstrated in the paper?

7. The paper uses a category-level background model based on NeRF. Why does modeling the background explicitly help improve the quality of foreground reconstructions? What are the limitations of just using something like background subtraction?

8. What effects does the morphology code regularization technique have on the diversity of shapes that can be represented? Does too much regularization cause the model to ignore instance-specific details? What is the tradeoff?

9. How scalable is the approach to new object categories? What sort of supervision or prior knowledge is required? Could it work on completely novel categories unlike anything seen during training?

10. The motion transfer results suggest the method learns a disentangled representation of morphology and articulation. How valid is this claim? What other experiments could help evaluate the degree of disentanglement achieved?
