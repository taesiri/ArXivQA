# [Reconstructing Animatable Categories from Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06351)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is:How can we build animatable 3D models of deformable object categories from monocular videos while disentangling variations across instances from time-specific variations within an instance?The key challenges they aim to address are:1) Modeling the morphological variation across instances within a category (e.g. different dog breeds). This is difficult to disentangle from time-varying variations within a single instance (e.g. a dog's articulation and deformation over time).2) Dealing with the limited and impoverished nature of in-the-wild videos, where objects may be partially observable from limited viewpoints and with inaccurate segmentation masks. The model needs to listen to common structures across the category while staying faithful to the input views. Their proposed approach RAC introduces three main ideas to address these challenges:1) Specializing skeletons to instances via optimization, allowing better disentanglement of morphology and articulation.2) A method for latent space regularization that encourages shared structure across the category while maintaining instance details.3) Using 3D background models to disentangle objects from the background.The overall goal is to learn category-level 3D models from monocular videos that can generate different instances and their motions, without requiring 3D supervision or registrations.In summary, the paper aims to address the problem of building animatable category-level 3D models from in-the-wild monocular videos, while disentangling variations across instances and motions over time.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper presents Reconstructing Animatable Categories from Videos (RAC), a method to build animatable 3D models of object categories from monocular video collections. The key contributions are:1. Learning category-level shape and skeleton models from videos without 3D supervision. This allows capturing variations across instances within a category (e.g. different dog breeds).2. Disentangling between-instance morphological variations from within-instance pose and motion over time. This allows motion transfer across instances. 3. Modeling the background scene as a 3D NeRF to improve object segmentation.4. Achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on humans, dogs and cats using only 50-100 casual internet videos per category.The main novelty is building category-level models without 3D supervision that can disentangle shape, appearance and motion variations across a category. This is enabled by optimizing instance-specific skeletons and shape codes, regularizing the shape space, and modeling the background. The results show the potential to scale articulated 3D reconstruction to new categories from in-the-wild videos.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:The paper presents RAC, a method to reconstruct animatable 3D models of deformable object categories like cats, dogs, and humans from monocular videos by disentangling variations across instances (e.g. morphology) from variations within instances over time (e.g. articulations), enabling motion transfer across instances in a category.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key points comparing this paper to other related work:- The paper focuses on reconstructing 3D animatable models of deformable object categories (e.g. cats, dogs, humans) from monocular videos. This is in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on reconstructing single object instances or rigid objects. - The method disentangles between-instance variations (different shapes/appearances within a category) from within-instance variations (articulations and deformations over time) in the 3D model. This allows for applications like motion retargeting across instances. Many prior methods do not explicitly disentangle these factors.- The approach uses only monocular videos for supervision and does not rely on 3D scans, templates, or other strong priors like parametric models. This makes it more scalable to new categories compared to model-based methods.- A key contribution is the use of category-level background models to improve segmentation and handle partial views. This differs from prior video-based reconstruction methods that ignore the background.- The method specializes skeletons to instances via optimization rather than manual rigging. It also allows bone lengths to change between instances to capture shape differences.- Compared to other video-based reconstruction methods like BANMo and NeRF-based category modeling, this approach achieves state-of-the-art results on humans, dogs and cats by effectively combining ideas like conditional fields, skeleton-based deformation, and background modeling.In summary, the main advances are in disentangling factors of variation, handling partial views, and reconstructing finer details of non-rigid categories from monocular videos alone. The experiments demonstrate these contributions lead to high quality animatable category models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

Based on my reading of the paper, some potential future research directions the authors suggest are:- Improving the robustness and generalization ability of the camera viewpoint initialization. The current method requires rough viewpoint initialization either from a pre-trained network or manual annotation. Developing approaches that are more robust to diverse in-the-wild videos could be an interesting direction.- Jointly inferring the skeleton structure and topology along with the object shape, rather than using a predefined skeleton. This could allow the method to handle categories and motions where the ideal skeleton structure is unknown.- Incorporating a more detailed and accurate 3D background model, rather than just using it for segmentation. This could further improve foreground object reconstruction.- Extending the method to model more fine-grained details like facial expressions, hand articulation, etc. The current approach focuses more on overall body shape and motion. - Exploring other ways to regularize the latent spaces, beyond code swapping, to encourage disentanglement and generalization over the category.- Applying the technique to model more object categories beyond humans, dogs and cats. Testing the limits of the method on more diverse categories could reveal areas for improvement.- Combining the approach with parametric models like SMPL to take advantage of their robustness while still allowing for in-the-wild training data.- Improving runtime performance to make the method more practical for real applications.In summary, potential future work could focus on improving robustness, generalization, detail, scalability, and efficiency of the method. The disentangled category-level modeling is a promising direction with many opportunities for follow-up research.
