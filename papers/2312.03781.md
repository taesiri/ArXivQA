# [Lite-Mind: Towards Efficient and Versatile Brain Representation Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03781)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Decoding visual information from fMRI signals is challenging due to limited data availability and low signal-to-noise ratio. 
- State-of-the-art model MindEye uses a 996M MLP network per subject for fMRI-to-image retrieval, which has huge storage costs. 
- Individual variations between subjects necessitate training separate models per subject, posing storage and computing challenges for practical deployment.  

Proposed Solution:
- Propose Lite-Mind, an efficient and lightweight brain representation network for fMRI-to-image retrieval.
- Uses a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) Backbone instead of heavy MLP networks to map fMRI voxels and align them with CLIP image embeddings.  
- DFT captures global voxel features more efficiently compared to MLP's excessive focus on each voxel value.  
- Allows for practical on-device deployment due to 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye.

Main Contributions:
- Empirically demonstrate global voxel features are more useful than individual voxel values for retrieval.
- Propose efficient DFT Backbone as lightweight fMRI representation network.
- Achieve 94.3% retrieval accuracy on NSD dataset with 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye.
- Show migration to smaller GOD dataset, establishing new SOTA for zero-shot classification.
- Demonstrate efficiency, lightweight nature, versatility and universality of Lite-Mind across datasets.

In summary, the paper proposes an efficient and lightweight fMRI representation network called Lite-Mind for fMRI-to-image retrieval tasks. By utilizing Discrete Fourier Transforms instead of heavy MLP networks, Lite-Mind achieves impressive results while being practical for on-device deployment due to significantly lower parameters.
