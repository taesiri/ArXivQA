# [Low-Resource Counterspeech Generation for Indic Languages: The Case of   Bengali and Hindi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07262)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Online abusive speech is increasing, harming targeted groups and society. Content moderation strategies like deleting posts can restrict freedom of expression. 
- Counterspeech (CS) is a direct, non-negative response that counters abuse by respecting rights. 
- Most CS generation efforts focus on English. Needed for low-resource languages like Bengali and Hindi.

Solution:
- Create benchmark CS dataset of 5,062 abusive speech/CS pairs. 2,460 in Bengali, 2,602 in Hindi.
- Label CS strategies used like warning of consequences, empathy etc. 
- Implement transformer baseline models like GPT2, MT5, BLOOM, ChatGPT with monolingual and interlingual transfer mechanisms.
- Monolingual: Train, validate, test in same language. Expensive as need annotated datasets.  
- Joint Training: Combine both languages to train one model. Tests generalization.
- Synthetic Transfer: Translate English/Hindi CS data to Bengali/Hindi. Tests transferability.

Contributions:
- First CS generation effort for Bengali and Hindi. New benchmark dataset created.
- Experiment with models and transfer learning configurations. 
- Observe monolingual setting has best performance. Joint training can generate CS for multiple languages.
- Synthetic transfer works better for related languages (Bengali/Hindi) than English/Indian languages.

The paper focuses an important problem of generating counterspeech for abusive content in low resource Indian languages. Through datasets, models and experiments, it provides a benchmark for future research towards automating counterspeech generation.
