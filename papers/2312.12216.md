# [Sharing is CAIRing: Characterizing Principles and Assessing Properties   of Universal Privacy Evaluation for Synthetic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12216)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
- Sharing sensitive data like healthcare records is critical for research, but privacy regulations restrict it. Synthetic data promises to enable sharing while protecting privacy. 
- However, there is no consensus on how to evaluate privacy levels of synthetic tabular data. Various adhoc metrics are used, preventing comparison of results across studies. 
- Laypeople and regulators need understandable metrics to recognize if privacy is adequately protected.

Proposed Solution: 
- Identify principles of good universal privacy metrics for synthetic tabular data to enable comparability and guide selection/design of metrics. 
- Develop a rubric scoring metrics on 16 dimensions over 4 categories: Comparability, Applicability, Interpretability and Representativeness (CAIR).
- Score existing metrics with the rubric to showcase usefulness for comparing strengths/weaknesses.

Key Contributions:
- First principles (CAIR) defining good practices for privacy evaluation metrics for synthetic tabular data. 
- Rubric operationalizing CAIR principles into 16 concrete scored dimensions like scale invariance, visualization capability etc.
- Demonstration of using rubric to review and compare strengths/weaknesses of existing metrics.
- Guidance to researchers on improving metrics and to regulators on standardized evaluation.
- Furthering agreement and adoption of appropriate universal privacy metrics for synthetic data.

In summary, the paper makes an important first step at defining standardized practices for evaluating and comparing privacy guarantees of synthetically generated tabular data to enable safe sharing while protecting individuals' privacy.
