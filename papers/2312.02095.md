# [Single-sample versus case-control sampling scheme for Positive Unlabeled   data: the story of two scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02095)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper argues that the performance of classifiers based on Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for positive unlabeled (PU) data can significantly deteriorate when a method designed for a case-control sampling scheme is applied to a single-sample scenario, and vice versa. The authors explain that the difference lies in the structure of the unlabeled sample - in the case-control scheme it corresponds to the general population distribution, whereas in the single-sample scheme it is a mixture with different mixing proportions. They formally show that applying an ERM designed for one scenario to the other is only valid under very specific conditions. To demonstrate, they introduce nnPUss, a single-sample version of the popular nnPU classifier, and compare its performance to nnPUcc on both single-sample and case-control datasets. The experiments confirm that using the incorrect method causes substantial performance drops, especially for high label frequencies. The accuracy difference can be over 30% in some cases. The authors conclude that taking into account the labeling scenario is crucial, and show that adapting methods like nnPU simply requires changing the empirical risk calculation.
