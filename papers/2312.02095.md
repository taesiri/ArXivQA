# [Single-sample versus case-control sampling scheme for Positive Unlabeled   data: the story of two scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02095)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper argues that the performance of classifiers based on Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for positive unlabeled (PU) data can significantly deteriorate when a method designed for a case-control sampling scheme is applied to a single-sample scenario, and vice versa. The authors explain that the difference lies in the structure of the unlabeled sample - in the case-control scheme it corresponds to the general population distribution, whereas in the single-sample scheme it is a mixture with different mixing proportions. They formally show that applying an ERM designed for one scenario to the other is only valid under very specific conditions. To demonstrate, they introduce nnPUss, a single-sample version of the popular nnPU classifier, and compare its performance to nnPUcc on both single-sample and case-control datasets. The experiments confirm that using the incorrect method causes substantial performance drops, especially for high label frequencies. The accuracy difference can be over 30% in some cases. The authors conclude that taking into account the labeling scenario is crucial, and show that adapting methods like nnPU simply requires changing the empirical risk calculation.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper argues that the performance of classifiers based on Empirical Risk Minimization for positive unlabeled data can significantly deteriorate when a method designed for the case-control sampling scheme is applied to the single-sample scenario, and vice versa, due to differences in the unlabeled data distribution between the two scenarios.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is:

1) Pointing out that the performance of classifiers designed for case-control positive unlabeled (PU) data can significantly deteriorate when applied directly to single-sample PU data, and vice versa. This is because the distribution of the unlabeled data differs between the two scenarios.

2) Introducing a modified version of the non-negative PU (nnPU) classifier called nnPUss that is tailored for the single-sample scenario. It differs from the original nnPU in how the empirical risk is calculated on the unlabeled data.

3) Experimentally demonstrating the performance differences on a variety of datasets when using the incorrectly specified method (nnPUcc on single sample data and vice versa). The differences become more pronounced as the labeling rate increases. The properly specified method consistently outperforms.

4) Providing an analysis of why the performance deteriorates, relating it to overfitting caused by the mismatch between the methods' assumptions and the actual data distribution. 

In summary, the key contribution is highlighting the importance of using sampling scenario-aware PU learning methods and providing a properly adapted version of a popular benchmark method as an example.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and keywords associated with it are:

- Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning
- Single-sample (s-s) scenario 
- Case-control (c-c) scenario
- Labeling scenarios
- Sampling schemes
- Empirical risk minimization (ERM)
- $nnPU_{ss}$ method
- $nnPU_{cc}$ method
- Risk functions
- Classification performance
- Overfitting

The paper discusses the importance of considering the labeling scenario when applying PU learning methods, and shows that using methods designed for one scenario (s-s or c-c) in the other scenario can lead to poor performance. It introduces adapted versions of the popular $nnPU$ method for each scenario, called $nnPU_{ss}$ and $nnPU_{cc}$. Experiments demonstrate that choosing the wrong method for a given labeling scenario, especially at high label frequencies, causes significant deteriorations in accuracy due to overfitting. Key terms reflect this focus on sampling schemes, risk functions, classification methods and performance in PU learning.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. What is the key difference between the single-sample (s-s) and case-control (c-c) scenarios for positive-unlabeled (PU) data? How does this difference impact the behavior of methods designed for one scenario when applied to the other?

2. Explain in detail how the distribution of the unlabeled data differs between the s-s and c-c scenarios, especially when the labeling propensity c is high. Why does this distributional difference become more pronounced as c increases?  

3. Walk through the mathematical derivations showing how the risk function R(g) differs between the s-s and c-c scenarios. Explain the key assumptions made and how Proposition 1 formally establishes the conditions for when applying the risk for one scenario to the other is invalid.

4. What specifically causes the non-negative risk component of the Empirical Risk Minimization to be misestimated when the wrong sampling scenario method is applied? Explain both the s-s and c-c cases.  

5. Analyze the behavior of the loss function components over training epochs when the incorrect PU learning method is applied, as shown in Figure 5. Explain the reasons why the training fails in these cases.

6. Why is overfitting more likely to occur for PU learning methods compared to standard binary classification? How does the overfitting manifest when the wrong sampling scenario method is used?

7. Propose some ideas for adapting additional PU learning methods designed for the c-c scenario to the s-s scenario. What components would need to be modified?

8. Discuss the experimental results showing improved performance of the properly tailored nnPU method over a wide range of labeling frequencies c. Why does the advantage grow substantially when c is high?

9. Suggest some potential areas of further research related to understanding the impact of sampling scenarios on PU learning methods. What key questions remain unexplored?  

10. How easy or difficult is it to adapt most PU learning methods designed for the c-c scenario to effectively handle the s-s case instead? What methods might transfer more readily compared to others?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There are two common scenarios for collecting positive-unlabeled (PU) data: single-sample (s-s) and case-control (c-c). Many PU learning methods are designed for the c-c scenario.
- Directly applying c-c methods to s-s data can lead to poor performance, but this issue is rarely discussed in literature. 

Proposed Solution:
- The paper formally analyzes why c-c Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) classifiers fail on s-s data, except in very specific cases. The key difference is the structure/distribution of the unlabeled data.
- They introduce a modified ERM classifier called nnPU_{ss}, adapted for the s-s scenario, and compare its performance to the original nnPU_{cc} classifier designed for c-c data.

Experiments:
- Evaluation on 18 diverse datasets spanning images, text and tabular data.
- Show significant gaps in accuracy when using the mismatched classifier, especially for label frequencies â‰¥ 0.5. The performance gap grows as the label frequency increases.
- Demonstrate that the mismatched classifiers tend to overfit, while the matched ones improve steadily with more labels.
- Compare the components of the risk functions during training to analyze the behavior.

Key Contributions:  
- Formal analysis showing why standard ERM classifiers fail for mismatched PU data scenarios
- Introduction of a modified ERM classifier nnPU_{ss} adapted for the single-sample scenario
- Extensive experiments demonstrating substantial gaps in accuracy from applying mismatched classifiers
- Analysis of classifier behavior during training when mismatched to explain poor performance
- Practical guidance that properly accounting for the PU sampling scenario is crucial for good performance
