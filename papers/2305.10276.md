# [Chain-of-Symbol Prompting Elicits Planning in Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10276)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can symbolic representations of spatial relationships, in the form of a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS), improve the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on complex spatial understanding and planning tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1. Representing spatial relationships with symbols rather than redundant natural language text will allow for more efficient prompting of LLMs. 

2. This symbolic prompting method (CoS) will improve the performance of LLMs on complex spatial planning and reasoning tasks compared to standard prompting methods.

3. CoS prompting will require fewer tokens/less text to represent the spatial relationships, reducing computational costs.

So in summary, the central research question seems to investigate whether symbolic prompting can enhance both the performance and efficiency of LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, compared to more standard prompting approaches. The hypotheses focus on the potential benefits of using condensed symbolic representations over verbose natural language descriptions for spatial relationships when prompting LLMs.

Does this capture the core research question and hypotheses of the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have a different interpretation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The authors evaluate large language models (LLMs) on both existing classic spatial understanding tasks and proposed synthetic spatial planning tasks. They find there is still room for performance improvement on current LLMs even with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. 

2. The authors propose a novel method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) prompting, which converts complex environments described in natural language into condensed symbolic representations. CoS significantly improves LLMs on the spatial tasks, with large gains in accuracy and reductions in the number of tokens needed.

3. The authors conduct an in-depth analysis of CoS to explore the effects of using different symbols, evaluating on different LLMs, and using different languages. This shows the robustness of the CoS method.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the proposal and evaluation of the CoS prompting technique to improve spatial understanding and planning abilities in LLMs through the use of symbolic representations. The large performance gains and efficiency improvements of CoS are demonstrated through extensive experiments on spatial planning tasks and an existing spatial QA dataset.

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here is a summary of how this paper compares to other research in the field of spatial reasoning and planning for large language models:

- The paper evaluates large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT on complex spatial planning tasks described in natural language, finding there is still room for improvement even when using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. This highlights a limitation in current LLMs' ability to handle spatial reasoning tasks purely from text.

- The paper proposes a new prompting method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) that converts natural language descriptions of spatial relationships into symbolic representations. Using CoS with just a few demonstrations gives significant performance gains over CoT on spatial planning tasks, demonstrating the benefit of symbolic representations.

- Other recent work has also found LLMs struggle on spatial reasoning and text-based games with multi-step inference. However, these papers did not propose methods to improve LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities like CoS.

- Some concurrent work explores converting natural language to executable robot actions using ChatGPT, which is related but does not focus on symbolic spatial reasoning like this paper. Other concurrent work uses symbol tuning, but not targeted at spatial tasks.

- Overall, this paper makes a novel contribution in evaluating LLMs on complex spatial planning from text, identifying limitations, and proposing an effective prompting technique to enhance spatial reasoning by using symbolic representations. The gains from CoS highlight the importance of symbolic knowledge in addition to natural language for achieving more human-like reasoning.

In summary, this paper identifies an important gap in current LLM abilities for spatial reasoning, and introduces a new prompting technique to address this gap. The results demonstrate clear improvements over existing methods and contribute new insights into how we can enhance reasoning in LLMs.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Applying CoS to more models of different sizes and architectures to further analyze the effectiveness and emergence of symbolic reasoning abilities. The authors only evaluated CoS on two LLMs (ChatGPT and text-davinci-003) due to limited time and resources. Testing on more models could provide more insights.

- Exploring the integration of CoS with computer vision models in downstream tasks. The authors suggest pipelining CoS with image captioning models that convert visual environments to text descriptions. Testing the robustness of CoS when handling noisy inputs from vision models could be useful.

- Applying CoS to more complex planning tasks like robot path planning and navigation grounded in language instructions. The symbolic representation of environments in CoS could potentially be useful in these areas related to spatial reasoning and planning.

- Comparing CoS to other methods of representing structured knowledge, like knowledge graphs, for spatial reasoning tasks. This could reveal the strengths and weaknesses of symbolic prompting versus more structured knowledge representations.

- Incorporating CoS into the training process for LLMs, rather than just prompting. Using symbolic representations during pre-training could further improve spatial reasoning abilities.

- Testing CoS on broader forms of analogical and abstract reasoning beyond spatial tasks, to see if condensed symbolic prompts generalize well to other reasoning domains.

In summary, the main future directions focus on expanding the testing of CoS to more models, tasks, and integration with other techniques like vision and knowledge representations to further demonstrate and analyze its capabilities. Leveraging CoS in training, not just prompting, is also suggested. Overall the results indicate symbolic prompting is a promising area needing more research.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) prompting to improve the ability of large language models (LLMs) to understand complex spatial relationships and conduct planning in virtual environments described in natural language text. The authors evaluate LLMs on spatial planning tasks and find there is room for improvement. CoS prompting converts the natural language description of a spatial environment into a symbolic representation using condensed symbols to represent spatial relationships between objects. In experiments on planning tasks like Brick World, NLVR-based Manipulation, and Natural Language Navigation, CoS prompting substantially improves accuracy over regular Chain-of-Thought prompting with natural language, by up to 60.8%. CoS also reduces the number of tokens for the intermediate reasoning steps by up to 65.8%. The results demonstrate CoS allows a more efficient representation of spatial environments compared to natural language, leading to better performance by LLMs on spatial understanding and planning tasks with lower computational cost.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper investigates the use of symbolic representations in prompting large language models (LLMs) for complex spatial understanding and planning tasks. The authors evaluate LLMs on both existing spatial QA datasets and novel synthetic planning tasks, finding room for improved performance even with chain-of-thought prompting. They propose a new prompting method, Chain-of-Symbol (CoS), which represents spatial relationships using symbols rather than natural language in the intermediate reasoning steps. 

The authors demonstrate that CoS prompting substantially improves LLM performance on spatial tasks compared to chain-of-thought prompting, with large gains in accuracy (up to 60.8%) and lower token usage. They conduct extensive analyses showing CoS is robust across different symbols, models, and languages. Key advantages are the more efficient symbolic representation and elimination of redundant information. Overall, the work makes important progress in advancing LLMs' spatial planning abilities through symbolic prompting.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) prompting to improve the spatial understanding and planning abilities of large language models (LLMs). CoS converts the complex spatial relationships described in natural language in the simulated environments into condensed symbolic representations in the chained intermediate reasoning steps. Specifically, instead of using intermediate thinking steps described in natural language text as in conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, CoS replaces the spatial relationships with random symbols while keeping the object mentions, removing other redundant descriptions. For example, "Box A is above Box B" may become "A // B" where "//" symbolizes an above relationship. The CoS demonstrations are produced by first eliciting CoT demonstrations from the LLM, validating and correcting them, then converting to symbolic form. The CoS demonstrations are used to guide the LLM to reason through spatial planning tasks. Experiments on tasks like Brick World, NLVR Manipulation and Navigation show CoS improves accuracy and efficiency over natural language CoT prompting.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper investigates the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex spatial understanding and planning tasks that require reasoning about virtual environments described in natural language text. The authors find that current popular LLMs like ChatGPT still struggle on such tasks, even with chain-of-thought prompting. To address this, they propose a new method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) prompting, which represents spatial relationships and environments using symbolic notations rather than full natural language in the intermediate reasoning steps. For example, objects may be denoted as (color, shape, size) triplets and their spatial relationships denoted concisely using symbols like "/" and "->" rather than full sentences. Experiments on synthetic planning tasks and the SPARTQA dataset show CoS prompting substantially improves performance over chain-of-thought, increasing accuracy by up to 60.8% in one scenario. The condensed symbolic representations also reduce the number of tokens substantially compared to verbose natural language descriptions. Overall, the work demonstrates the promise of using symbolic representations to help LLMs better reason about complex spatial environments and relationships described in text.

This paper investigates the use of symbolic representations for spatial relationships to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex spatial understanding and planning tasks.
