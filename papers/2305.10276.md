# [Chain-of-Symbol Prompting Elicits Planning in Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10276)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be:

How can symbolic representations of spatial relationships, in the form of a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS), improve the performance and efficiency of large language models (LLMs) on complex spatial understanding and planning tasks?

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1. Representing spatial relationships with symbols rather than redundant natural language text will allow for more efficient prompting of LLMs. 

2. This symbolic prompting method (CoS) will improve the performance of LLMs on complex spatial planning and reasoning tasks compared to standard prompting methods.

3. CoS prompting will require fewer tokens/less text to represent the spatial relationships, reducing computational costs.

So in summary, the central research question seems to investigate whether symbolic prompting can enhance both the performance and efficiency of LLMs on spatial reasoning tasks, compared to more standard prompting approaches. The hypotheses focus on the potential benefits of using condensed symbolic representations over verbose natural language descriptions for spatial relationships when prompting LLMs.

Does this capture the core research question and hypotheses of the paper? Let me know if you need any clarification or have a different interpretation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:

1. The authors evaluate large language models (LLMs) on both existing classic spatial understanding tasks and proposed synthetic spatial planning tasks. They find there is still room for performance improvement on current LLMs even with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. 

2. The authors propose a novel method called Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) prompting, which converts complex environments described in natural language into condensed symbolic representations. CoS significantly improves LLMs on the spatial tasks, with large gains in accuracy and reductions in the number of tokens needed.

3. The authors conduct an in-depth analysis of CoS to explore the effects of using different symbols, evaluating on different LLMs, and using different languages. This shows the robustness of the CoS method.

In summary, the main contribution seems to be the proposal and evaluation of the CoS prompting technique to improve spatial understanding and planning abilities in LLMs through the use of symbolic representations. The large performance gains and efficiency improvements of CoS are demonstrated through extensive experiments on spatial planning tasks and an existing spatial QA dataset.
