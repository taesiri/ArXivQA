# [MeViS: A Large-scale Benchmark for Video Segmentation with Motion   Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08544)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my review, the main research question this paper seeks to address is: How feasible is it to use motion expressions as the primary cue to ground and segment objects in videos?The paper introduces a new large-scale dataset called MeViS (Motion expressions Video Segmentation) to investigate the potential of leveraging motion expressions for referring video object segmentation. The key hypotheses are:1) Current referring video object segmentation datasets focus too much on static attributes and downplay the importance of motion expressions.2) Motion expressions can be an effective cue for identifying and segmenting objects in videos if modeled properly.  3) Existing referring video object segmentation methods struggle with motion expression based segmentation due to lack of emphasis on motion modeling.To test these hypotheses, the paper benchmarks existing methods on the new MeViS dataset and shows state-of-the-art methods perform much worse on MeViS compared to other datasets. This supports the hypothesis that existing methods are ineffective for motion expression based segmentation.The paper proposes a baseline model that incorporates better motion modeling. The improved performance of this baseline model on MeViS lends support to the hypothesis that motion expressions can enable segmentation if modeled effectively.In summary, the main research question is assessing the feasibility of motion expression based video segmentation, which the paper investigates through new dataset construction, benchmarking and baselines. The results generally support the hypotheses regarding the limitations of existing work and the potential of motion expressions.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Proposing a new large-scale dataset called MeViS (Motion expressions Video Segmentation) for language-guided video segmentation. The key features of MeViS are:- It contains 2000+ videos with 8000+ objects and 28,000+ motion expressions describing the objects. This makes it larger than previous datasets in this area.- The videos and objects have longer durations compared to previous datasets, ensuring adequate motion. - The language expressions emphasize motion rather than static attributes, making temporal understanding essential.- Expressions can refer to multiple objects instead of just one.2. Conducting comprehensive experiments to benchmark MeViS, evaluating existing state-of-the-art referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods on it. The results demonstrate that current methods struggle on MeViS compared to other datasets, highlighting the need for further research on motion expression-based video segmentation.3. Proposing a baseline approach called LMPM (Language-guided Motion Perception and Matching) tailored for MeViS. It incorporates motion perception on object embeddings and a matching mechanism to identify target objects based on motion expressions.In summary, the key contribution is the proposal of a new challenging benchmark dataset MeViS to spur research on motion expression-guided video segmentation, along with analysis of existing methods and a baseline approach. MeViS highlights the limitations of current RVOS methods in handling complex motion expressions.
