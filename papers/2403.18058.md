# [COIG-CQIA: Quality is All You Need for Chinese Instruction Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18058)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- There is a lack of high-quality Chinese instruction tuning datasets compared to English. Existing Chinese datasets have issues like not aligning with natural Chinese communication patterns, lacking genuine linguistic data, containing problematic data, and being small-scale.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce COIG-CQIA, a meticulously filtered and processed Chinese instruction tuning dataset sourced from authentic linguistic data across diverse domains.

- Data is collected from various Chinese internet sources including Q&A communities, Wikis, examinations, and existing NLP datasets. Sources undergo thorough cleaning, restructuring and manual review.

- Dataset focuses on quality, diversity and relevance to better align model behavior with human interactions.

Main Contributions:

- Propose COIG-CQIA, a high-quality Chinese instruction tuning dataset specifically designed to align with human interaction through rigorous filtering.

- Explore influence of various data sources on model performance, offering insights for selecting training data from Chinese internet.

- Benchmark tests and human evaluations confirm models fine-tuned on COIG-CQIA exhibit superior performance, establishing it as a valuable resource for Chinese NLP.

In summary, the paper introduces a meticulously filtered Chinese instruction tuning dataset to align model training with real-world Chinese user interactions. Experiments and analyses provide insights on data selection while results validate the quality and usefulness of COIG-CQIA.
