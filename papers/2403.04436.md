# [Learning Human-to-Humanoid Real-Time Whole-Body Teleoperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04436)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Enabling real-time whole-body teleoperation of a full-sized humanoid robot by a human operator using only an RGB camera is challenging. Key difficulties include: (1) lack of a large-scale human motion dataset feasible for humanoids to track, (2) complexity in developing a robust controller that can track diverse free-form human motions in real-time, (3) bridging the sim-to-real gap to transfer the controller.

Proposed Solution - Human to Humanoid (H2O):
1) Retargeting human motions: Fit a SMPL model to the humanoid structure and retarget AMASS motion dataset. Use a privileged simulation policy to filter infeasible motions, obtaining a cleaned dataset.

2) Sim-to-real training: Design a practical state space using keypoint positions for real-time tracking. Train a robust imitator using the cleaned dataset, with extensive domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer.  

3) Real-time teleoperation system: At test time, track operator motions using an RGB camera and off-the-shelf pose estimator to provide goals for the humanoid controller.

Key Contributions:
1) A scalable sim-to-data process to obtain large-scale feasible human motions tailored for the humanoid 
2) Sim-to-real transfer of a whole-body RL tracking controller effective for diverse motions
3) Demonstrated real-time teleoperation system enabling dynamic skills like kicking, walking, waving, etc using only an RGB camera

The system pushes the boundary of real-time humanoid teleoperation without restrictive lab setups. It provides a learning-based alternative over model-based methods, generalizable to more dynamic and free-form motions.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents H2O, a reinforcement learning framework that enables real-time whole-body teleoperation of a full-sized humanoid robot using only an RGB camera by retargeting and filtering a large-scale human motion dataset to train a robust motion imitation policy that can transfer from simulation to the real world in a zero-shot manner.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. A scalable "sim-to-data" process to obtain a large-scale motion dataset feasible for the real-world humanoid robot by retargeting and filtering human motions using a privileged motion imitator. 

2. Sim-to-real transfer of the RL-based whole-body tracking controller that scales to a large number of motions using extensive domain randomization.

3. A real-time teleoperation system with an RGB camera and 3D human pose estimation, demonstrating fulfillment of various whole-body motions including walking, pick-and-place, stroller pushing, boxing, hand-waving, ball kicking, etc on a real humanoid robot.

In summary, the paper presents the first demonstration of learning-based real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation using vision, enabling the humanoid robot to mimic diverse dynamic human motions in real time. The key novelty lies in the sim-to-real training pipeline that creates feasible humanoid motion datasets and transfers policies to the real robot in a zero-shot manner.
