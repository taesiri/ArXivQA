# [Can language models learn from explanations in context?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02329)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether explanations of few-shot examples can help language models learn and improve their performance on new tasks. Specifically, the authors investigate whether adding explanations of the answers in a few-shot prompt leads to better language model performance on questions from those tasks, compared to few-shot prompts without explanations. They also explore whether explanations tuned for performance on a small validation set offer even greater benefits.The key hypothesis is that explanations of examples will help language models infer the correct reasoning process for a new task, thereby improving their few-shot performance on that task. The authors test this by prompting large language models with few-shot examples from diverse reasoning tasks, with and without explanations, and evaluating the models' accuracy at answering new questions from those tasks.In summary, the central research question is whether explanations can support in-context learning and improve few-shot performance of language models. The authors hypothesize that explanations will provide this benefit by clarifying the reasoning principles that relate the examples to answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is investigating whether providing explanations of examples can help language models learn new tasks from just a few examples (few-shot learning). The authors annotated examples from 40 challenging reasoning tasks with expert explanations, as well as control explanations. They evaluated several language models on these tasks with and without the explanations. The key findings are:- Explanations can improve few-shot performance, even without tuning them for the model or task. This benefit emerges only for large language models.- Explanations that are tuned or selected using a small validation set offer larger benefits. - Explanations outperform carefully matched control explanations, suggesting the benefits are not just from surface features.- The authors emphasize the value of hierarchical statistical models for analyzing these complex nested results across tasks, examples, and conditions.In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that explanations of examples can support in-context learning in large language models, shedding light on their capabilities. The authors discuss implications for few-shot prompting and for understanding the learning abilities of large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:The paper investigates whether including explanations of examples in few-shot prompts can help large language models perform better on challenging reasoning tasks, and finds that untuned explanations provide a modest benefit while explanations tuned on a small validation set can substantially improve performance.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

Here are a few key ways this paper compares to related work on using explanations to improve language model performance:- Focus on post-answer explanations. Unlike some prior work that focuses on explanations or reasoning chains before the answer, this paper explores explanations provided after the answer. As discussed in the paper, this allows unchanged evaluation and different scientific insights. - Broad set of challenging tasks. Many related works evaluate on a narrow set of tasks like arithmetic or common NLP benchmarks. This paper uses a diverse set of 40 tasks sampled to be challenging.- Careful control conditions. To test if semantics or lower-level features drive effects, the authors compare real explanations to various matched controls like shuffled words or explanations for other examples.- Statistical modeling of dependencies. The paper fittingly uses hierarchical models to analyze the nested structure of results across models, tasks, examples etc. This allows more rigorous estimation of effects.- Benefits of explanations without tuning. A key finding is that even raw untuned explanations help, not just tuned or optimized explanations. This makes the findings more practical.- Emergence of benefits with scale. The benefits of explanations only emerge in the largest models, echoing findings on scaledependence of abilities like few-shot learning.Overall, the paper provides compelling evidence that explanations can enhance in-context learning in large language models, using thorough experiments and analyses. A valuable contribution to the growing literature on prompting language models.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

The authors suggest several potential directions for future research:- Evaluating the effects of explanations on a broader set of tasks beyond BIG-Bench. They note that the idiosyncratic, adversarially-sampled nature of BIG-Bench tasks may amplify or suppress the benefits of explanations compared to more standard NLP tasks.- Exploring the effects of explanations in models trained or tuned to make use of explanations and instructions. They suggest models trained in this way may show greater benefits.- Investigating differences between human and model use of explanations, for example using explanations as a setting to compare human and model language processing.- Exploring ways to further improve the benefits of explanations, such as by combining them with other techniques like chained reasoning.- Studying the effects of explanations in larger models, which they predict may show even greater benefits.- Examining the possibility that explanations may be uniquely beneficial in a certain "zone of proximal development" where baseline few-shot performance is moderate.- Testing whether certain types of explanations are more effective for certain task types or clusters. Their analysis of this question was limited by small sample sizes.In summary, they propose further work to better understand the conditions under which explanations are most beneficial, and how their benefits can be maximized in terms of task domains, model training, and prompt engineering techniques.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates whether explanations of examples in few-shot prompts can help language models (LMs) learn new tasks more effectively. The authors annotated examples from 40 challenging reasoning tasks with expert explanations, as well as control explanations, and evaluated the performance of LMs ranging from 1B to 280B parameters when prompted with examples with or without explanations. They found that for the largest LM, adding explanations improved performance compared to prompts without them, even without tuning the explanations. Furthermore, explanations tuned on a small validation set or selected jointly with examples offered larger improvements. The benefits were unique to real explanations, as control conditions did not help. The authors used hierarchical statistical models to precisely quantify these effects. Overall, the results suggest that explanations can support in-context learning for large LMs, shed light on their inference abilities, and demonstrate the value of careful experimental methods in studying increasingly complex model behaviors.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:The paper investigates whether providing explanations for the example input-output pairs in few-shot prompts can help large language models learn new tasks more effectively. The authors created a dataset by annotating questions from 40 challenging reasoning tasks sampled from BIG-Bench with expert explanations of the answers. They evaluated several language models ranging from 1 billion to 280 billion parameters on these tasks using prompts with different combinations of task instructions, few-shot examples, and control explanations. The key findings were that for the largest 280B model, adding untuned explanations to few-shot prompts led to modest but significant improvements in performance compared to prompts without explanations. Explanations that were tuned on a small validation set led to even larger benefits. The largest model also improved more with explanations compared to smaller models. Analysis using hierarchical statistical models showed that the benefits of explanations were not driven purely by simple features like length, but rather depended on the relationship between the explanation and example. Overall, the results suggest that explanations can support in-context learning for large language models, even without training specifically for explanation.

Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:The paper investigates whether explanations of examples in few-shot prompts can help language models (LMs) perform new tasks. The authors annotate questions from 40 challenging reasoning tasks sampled from BIG-Bench with expert explanations of the answers. They evaluate several LMs, ranging from 1 billion to 280 billion parameters, on the tasks using prompts with different combinations of examples, explanations, instructions, and control conditions. Explanations include untuned expert explanations as well as tuned explanations optimized on a small validation set. The prompts are evaluated by conditioning on them and scoring the model's likelihood of the correct answer to new target questions. The results are analyzed using hierarchical statistical models that account for the nested dependencies among tasks, prompts, examples, and conditions. This allows the authors to estimate the unique effects of the different prompt components like explanations while controlling for other factors.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

The paper is addressing the question of whether providing explanations of examples can help language models learn better from few-shot prompts. Specifically, it investigates whether adding explanations of the answers in a few-shot prompt can improve the performance of language models on new questions from the task. The motivation is that explanations help humans learn and generalize better from examples. So the authors explore whether explanations can likewise allow language models to better infer and perform new tasks from just a few examples.The key research questions seem to be:1) Can explanations of examples improve few-shot performance of language models? 2) Do explanations provide benefits beyond other controls that match surface features?3) Do the benefits depend on model scale or task type? 4) How do the benefits of explanations compare to instructions or selecting examples?So in summary, the main focus is on quantifying whether explanations of examples can improve language models' few-shot learning abilities, across various conditions.
