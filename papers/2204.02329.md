# Can language models learn from explanations in context?

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

The central research question this paper addresses is whether explanations of few-shot examples can help language models learn and improve their performance on new tasks. Specifically, the authors investigate whether adding explanations of the answers in a few-shot prompt leads to better language model performance on questions from those tasks, compared to few-shot prompts without explanations. They also explore whether explanations tuned for performance on a small validation set offer even greater benefits.The key hypothesis is that explanations of examples will help language models infer the correct reasoning process for a new task, thereby improving their few-shot performance on that task. The authors test this by prompting large language models with few-shot examples from diverse reasoning tasks, with and without explanations, and evaluating the models' accuracy at answering new questions from those tasks.In summary, the central research question is whether explanations can support in-context learning and improve few-shot performance of language models. The authors hypothesize that explanations will provide this benefit by clarifying the reasoning principles that relate the examples to answers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is investigating whether providing explanations of examples can help language models learn new tasks from just a few examples (few-shot learning). The authors annotated examples from 40 challenging reasoning tasks with expert explanations, as well as control explanations. They evaluated several language models on these tasks with and without the explanations. The key findings are:- Explanations can improve few-shot performance, even without tuning them for the model or task. This benefit emerges only for large language models.- Explanations that are tuned or selected using a small validation set offer larger benefits. - Explanations outperform carefully matched control explanations, suggesting the benefits are not just from surface features.- The authors emphasize the value of hierarchical statistical models for analyzing these complex nested results across tasks, examples, and conditions.In summary, the main contribution is demonstrating that explanations of examples can support in-context learning in large language models, shedding light on their capabilities. The authors discuss implications for few-shot prompting and for understanding the learning abilities of large language models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence summary of the key findings from the paper:The paper investigates whether including explanations of examples in few-shot prompts can help large language models perform better on challenging reasoning tasks, and finds that untuned explanations provide a modest benefit while explanations tuned on a small validation set can substantially improve performance.
