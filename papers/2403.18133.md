# [AE SemRL: Learning Semantic Association Rules with Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18133)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
- Association rule mining (ARM) from high-dimensional numerical data like time series is computationally expensive and produces a large number of rules that are difficult to explain. 
- Enriching time series data with semantics from knowledge graphs increases input size further and results in even higher execution times for ARM algorithms.
- There is a need for learning-based approaches that can learn semantic associations from time series data efficiently.

Proposed Solution - AE SemRL:
- The paper proposes an autoencoder-based approach called AE SemRL to learn semantic association rules from time series data mapped to a knowledge graph. 
- It utilizes a denoising autoencoder architecture and defines a pipeline to construct semantically enriched transactions from time series and knowledge graphs.
- It introduces an algorithm to extract association rules from the latent representation learned by the autoencoder based on reconstruction loss for marked input features.

Main Contributions:
- Formal definition of the problem of learning semantic association rules from time series data and knowledge graphs.
- Introduction of AE SemRL - the first deep learning based approach to learn semantic associations.
- Empirical evaluation on 3 datasets showing AE SemRL has 100s times faster execution time than FP-Growth and HHO in many cases.
- Experiments indicating autoencoders can learn associations which can be extracted as high quality rules based on criteria like lift, leverage, Zhang's metric.

The paper discusses current perspectives and future work directions like using other representation learning methods, improving rule extraction from latent spaces, and evaluating rules on domain tasks like anomaly detection.
