# [KoLA: Carefully Benchmarking World Knowledge of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09296)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper text, it seems the main research contributions and goals of this paper are:

1. To propose a new benchmark called KoLA (Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment) for carefully evaluating the world knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 

2. To design KoLA with careful consideration of three key factors:

- Ability modeling: Organizing evaluated abilities into a 4-level taxonomy inspired by human cognitive processes.

- Data: Using both known (Wikipedia) and evolving (newly crawled) data sources to enable fairer assessment. 

- Evaluation criteria: Adopting standardized overall scoring for better comparability and proposing a self-contrast metric to help evaluate knowledge hallucination.

3. To conduct an initial evaluation of 21 LLMs on KoLA, including commercial models like GPT-4 and open source models, and gain insights like:

- Larger models tend to memorize more knowledge from training data. 

- Alignment may improve higher cognitive abilities but harm memorization abilities.

- Open source models still lag behind commercial models in many knowledge-related tasks.

So in summary, the main research goals are to propose a carefully designed benchmark KoLA to enable more thorough, fair, and informative evaluations of world knowledge capabilities of LLMs, and use KoLA to gain insights about current LLMs. The research questions center around how to build a better benchmark and what it reveals about LLMs.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment (KoLA) for carefully evaluating the world knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). KoLA focuses on three key factors - ability modeling, data, and evaluation criteria. For ability modeling, it proposes a four-level taxonomy inspired by human cognition - Knowledge Memorization, Knowledge Understanding, Knowledge Applying, and Knowledge Creating. For data, it uses both Wikipedia as known data and continuously collected emerging articles as evolving data to ensure fairness. For evaluation, it employs standardized scores for comparability and a self-contrast metric to automatically assess knowledge hallucination in text generation. In the first season of KoLA, the authors evaluate 21 LLMs and obtain some interesting findings - e.g. larger models tend to memorize more, alignment may improve higher abilities but harm memorization, and open-source models lag behind commercial ones. The benchmark aims to provide helpful diagnostics and selections for developing knowledgeable LLMs and related applications. The data, leaderboard, and participation details are publicly available.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

KoLA is a new benchmark for evaluating the world knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark carefully designs three key factors: ability modeling, data sources, and evaluation criteria. For ability modeling, KoLA organizes tasks into a four-level taxonomy inspired by human cognition: Knowledge Memorization, Knowledge Understanding, Knowledge Applying, and Knowledge Creating. This allows for diagnostic insights into which knowledge-related skills an LLM may be lacking. For data, KoLA uses both Wikipedia, which is commonly used to train LLMs, and newly crawled "evolving" data from recent news and fiction. Using evolving data allows for fairer evaluation of LLMs' ability to handle new knowledge. For evaluation criteria, KoLA introduces standardized scores across tasks for better comparability and a self-contrast metric to automatically evaluate knowledge hallucination in generative tasks. 

In KoLA's first season, the authors evaluate 21 LLMs including commercial APIs like GPT-3 and open source models like GPT-NeoX. They find intriguing results like larger base model size correlating with better memorization, alignment seeming to improve higher-level abilities but harm memorization, and overall inferiority of open source versus commercial models. The benchmark enables tracking LLM development over time through evolving data evaluations. KoLA's data, leaderboard, and participation information are publicly available to facilitate research on knowledgeable LLMs and selecting LLMs for knowledge-related applications.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper introduces a new benchmark called Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment (KoLA) for carefully evaluating the world knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The key aspect of KoLA is the meticulous design of the evaluation methodology based on three main factors - ability modeling, data sources, and evaluation criteria. For ability modeling, KoLA organizes tasks into a 4-level taxonomy inspired by Bloom's taxonomy - Knowledge Memorization, Knowledge Understanding, Knowledge Applying, and Knowledge Creating. This allows for hierarchical assessment of knowledge abilities. For data, KoLA uses both Wikipedia, which is commonly used to train LLMs, as well as new articles published in the last 90 days as an evolving data source. Using both known and new data allows evaluating memorization and generalization. For evaluation criteria, KoLA introduces standardized scores to enable comparability across different tasks and metrics. It also uses a self-contrast metric to automatically evaluate knowledge hallucination in free-form generation by comparing it to knowledge-grounded generation. By carefully designing these three factors, KoLA aims to provide diagnostic and impartial evaluations of world knowledge in LLMs.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 Based on my reading of the paper, it seems the key problem the authors are trying to address is how to carefully and thoroughly evaluate the world knowledge capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Some of the key issues they discuss are:

- Existing benchmarks focus more on the breadth of abilities tested rather than the depth/quality of the evaluations. They argue more meticulous evaluation designs are needed for reliable and helpful insights. 

- Fairness of evaluations - given LLMs are trained on massive datasets, including ones that may overlap with benchmark datasets, how can evaluations be designed to minimize potential biases or advantages for models with certain training data.

- Evaluation metrics and criteria - many existing benchmarks use metrics that are not comparable across tasks or easy for non-experts to interpret. More standardized and intuitive metrics could make benchmark results more applicable. 

- Evaluating knowledge hallucination in generative tasks is challenging. New automated metrics are needed rather than reliance on human evaluation.

To address these issues, the paper introduces the Knowledge-oriented LLM Assessment (KoLA) benchmark. The key goals are to provide diagnostic evaluations of LLM knowledge capabilities through careful designs of the evaluated abilities, data sources, and evaluation criteria.
