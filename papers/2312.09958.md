# [Distilling Large Language Models for Matching Patients to Clinical   Trials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09958)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 

- Patient-trial matching is challenging but critical to accelerate clinical trials and facilitate access to treatments. Current approaches rely on extensive feature engineering, limiting scalability and reasoning ability. 

- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT variants have shown promise for automated interpretation of patient data, but face barriers to real-world deployment due to cost, privacy, reproducibility concerns. 

- There is a need for open-source LLMs that can match proprietary models' accuracy without high cost or privacy risks.

Solution:

- The paper conducts the first comprehensive analysis comparing proprietary (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-source (LLAMA) LLMs for patient-trial matching. 

- To enhance open-source LLM performance, the authors create a specialized synthetic dataset using GPT-4 and use it to fine-tune LLAMA models.

Key Contributions:

- Empirical evaluation reveals fine-tuned open-source LLAMA, particularly LLAMA-70B (Trial-LLAMA) matches or exceeds GPT-3.5 on automated and human-based assessments of ranking and criterion-level accuracy.

- Analysis shows fine-tuning significantly boosts open-source LLM performance despite using only synthetic data, demonstrating their adaptability for complex healthcare tasks.

- Detailed error analysis provides insights into continued challenges around implicit reasoning for LLMs. 

- The annotated evaluation dataset and fine-tuned Trial-LLAMA model are publicly released to advance research and real-world deployment.

In summary, the study shows properly tuned open-source LLMs can achieve proprietary-model levels of accuracy for patient-trial matching at lower cost and privacy risk. The public release of data and models aims to catalyze adoption of LLMs for clinical decision support.
