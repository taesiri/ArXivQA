# [FRESCO: Federated Reinforcement Energy System for Cooperative   Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18444)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

The paper presents FRESCO, a novel framework for controlling and optimizing decentralized energy systems like microgrids using hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained in a federated manner. 

Problem: With the rise of renewable energy, new dynamics are emerging in energy grids that require increased flexibility to integrate cleaner but more variable sources. At the same time, there are privacy concerns around collecting and sharing energy usage data from homes and businesses. Orchestrating the various components in an efficient, decentralized way is also challenging.

Proposed Solution: FRESCO consists of (1) a simulated microgrid environment, (2) a 3-layer hierarchy of RL agents, and (3) federated learning for privacy-preserving training. The RL agents control batteries and pricing at the home, microgrid, and distribution system levels respectively to reduce costs and emissions across the system. The framework allows evaluating system-wide impact compared to a baseline.

Key Contributions:
- Novel application of hierarchical RL with federated learning to microgrid control 
- Flexible simulated environment to test different scenarios
- Cooperative setup where greedy local agents end up optimizing global objectives
- Evaluates system-level benefits over baseline such as lower bills, reduced emissions

The initial results demonstrate FRESCO's potential, with the federated approach outperforming regular RL and approaching the theoretical optimal policy. Next steps are expanding experiments and developing the higher-level agents. The framework facilitates implementing decentralized energy markets to unlock flexibility from small-scale resources.
