# [Localization Is All You Evaluate: Data Leakage in Online Mapping   Datasets and How to Fix It](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06420)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper highlights a critical issue with the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets commonly used to train and evaluate online mapping models - there is significant geographical overlap between the training, validation, and test sets. Over 80\% of nuScenes and 40\% of Argoverse 2 validation and test samples are located within 5 meters of a training sample, allowing models to implicitly localize and "memorize" parts of the environment. To address this, the authors introduce new geographically separated splits of the datasets and show state-of-the-art online mapping methods exhibit much lower performance, with some dropping over 45 mAP, when evaluated on the proposed splits. This reveals these methods have poorer generalization ability than initially thought and that inflated performance numbers are being reported in the field. Additionally, re-validation of prior algorithmic choices shows diverging conclusions from those based on the original splits regarding the impact of different lifting techniques and auxiliary supervision. The splits introduced in this work, by removing geographical data leakage and enabling more reliable evaluation, will support improved generalization of online mapping models to new environments.
