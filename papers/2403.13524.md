# [Compress3D: a Compressed Latent Space for 3D Generation from a Single   Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13524)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Efficiently generating high-quality 3D assets from a single image remains challenging. Existing methods either rely on time-consuming optimization or generate in low-dimensional latent spaces that sacrifice quality. Directly generating 3D models conditioned solely on image embeddings tends to yield results not conforming well to the image. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a two-stage generative model called Compress3D to address the above issues. 

First, a triplane autoencoder is presented to compress colored 3D point clouds into a low-dimensional latent space while retaining geometric and texture details. The encoder projects features into a 3D volume, applies 3D convolutions to obtain high-resolution triplane features, and downsamples them to get a compressed triplane latent code. A novel 3D cross-attention mechanism enhances the latent representation. The decoder upsamples the code and predicts geometry and texture to reconstruct a high-quality 3D model.

Second, a diffusion prior model estimates a shape embedding from an input image embedding. This utilizes that shape embeddings contain more informative 3D geometry and texture cues than image embeddings. 

Finally, a triplane diffusion model generates a latent code conditioned on both the estimated shape embedding and image embedding. The decoded 3D model thus conforms better to the input image.

Main Contributions:
- A triplane autoencoder that efficiently compresses colored 3D point clouds into a low-dimensional latent space while allowing high-quality reconstruction.
- A 3D cross-attention mechanism to enhance the representation capacity of the latent space. 
- A two-stage generative approach utilizing both image and estimated shape embeddings as conditions to yield 3D models better conforming to the input image.
- Demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality 3D assets from a single image with less training data and time.
