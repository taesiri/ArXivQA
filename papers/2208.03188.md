# [BlenderBot 3: a deployed conversational agent that continually learns to   responsibly engage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03188)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How can we build dialogue agents that continue to improve from interactions with real users after deployment, in a responsible way?

The authors aim to construct an open-domain conversational agent called BlenderBot 3 that is deployed publicly, collects natural conversational data from users, and can learn continually from that data in order to improve over time. A critical part of the research program is studying how to learn responsibly from the collected data, including being robust to noisy or adversarial inputs.

The main hypotheses appear to be:

1) Deploying the agent publicly and learning from natural user interactions will provide better training data that matches real user needs and interests, compared to static datasets.

2) Continual learning methods can be developed that allow the agent to effectively learn from the interaction data in an online setting, to continually improve over time after deployment.  

3) Learning algorithms can be made robust to deal with noisy or adversarial inputs from some users, so that model improvements are reliable.

The paper seems focused on presenting the BlenderBot 3 model itself, its training and deployment, and the authors' plan to study continual learning from the collected conversations and release updates. Initial work on learning from conversational feedback and safe learning are presented in companion papers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 This paper introduces BlenderBot 3 (BB3), a large open-domain conversational agent with the following main features and contributions:

- The BB3 model itself, which is a 175B parameter transformer model fine-tuned on various conversational tasks using a modular and controllable framework. It builds on previous work like BlenderBot 1, BlenderBot 2, and SeeKeR.

- Details of training BB3 on human feedback to improve skills like internet search and knowledge grounding, using a new dataset called FITS. This is described more fully in a companion paper by Xu et al. (2022).

- A publicly accessible demo deployment of BB3 to collect natural conversations with users. The interface provides mechanisms for users to give feedback to the model.

- Methods for continual learning from user interactions in a robust way, handling issues like adversarial users. This is covered more fully in a companion paper by Ju et al. (2022).

- Evaluations showing BB3 outperforming existing openly available conversational agents on metrics like engagingness, knowledgeability, and safety.

- Public release of the BB3 model weights, code, datasets, and publications to enable open and reproducible research on improving conversational agents through interaction.

In summary, the main contribution is presenting BlenderBot 3 as an openly accessible conversational agent, its training methodology, deployment strategy, evaluation, and commitment to release artifacts to further research in this area. The goal is to study continually improving responsible AI agents.

 Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:

## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other research in the field:

- This paper focuses on deploying and continually learning from large open-domain conversational agents. Other recent work in this area includes Meena, DialoGPT, and LaMDA, which have shown the benefits of pre-training ever larger models on dialogue data. However, unlike this work, the models and training datasets for systems like Meena and LaMDA have not been openly released.

- A key contribution here is actually deploying the model and collecting natural conversational data from real users over time. Most prior work relies on static datasets collected via crowdsourcing. The promise of deployment is better coverage of topics users care about, and the ability to continually improve models. However, this is still an underexplored area compared to collecting static crowdsourced datasets.

- The approach tries to learn from conversational feedback, as humans don't always provide perfect demonstrations. Prior work has mainly focused on learning from human demonstrations or from explicit rewards. Learning from implicit signals like conversational cues is an interesting direction with less exploration so far.

- They study learning while being robust to unsafe or adversarial behavior, whereas most prior work assumes benign inputs. This research direction is crucial for real-world deployment but relatively underexplored.

- The model architecture uses retrieve-and-refine modules over an OPT transformer base, similar to recent work like REALM for QA and SeeKeR for dialogue. The modular setup is quite sophisticated compared to end-to-end models.

- The model is very large scale at 175B parameters. Most prior conversational models are not nearly this size, though there is a general trend towards larger models in NLP.

- The work aims to be completely open - the models, code, and data collection allow full reproducibility, whereas much existing work is proprietary and unavailable. Openness is critical for fast community progress.

So in summary, this work pushes the boundaries on model scale, architectural sophistication, interaction with real users, learning from feedback, safety, and research openness compared to most existing dialogue research. The focus on continual learning and responsible deployment is timely and sets an ambitious research agenda.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the main future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Continuing to collect conversational data from the BlenderBot 3 deployment and using it to study continual learning methods. The paper mentions releasing model snapshots and data from user interactions so researchers can explore techniques to improve the model over time.

- Exploring the best ways to collect feedback during deployment that leads to model improvements. The paper discusses evaluating different types of feedback like binary ratings, free-form comments, or supervised responses. Finding natural ways to elicit useful feedback is an open challenge.

- Developing methods that are robust to noisy or adversarial data collected during deployment. The paper introduces techniques to detect unhelpful users and filter their contributions. More work is needed in this area.

- Studying how to optimize the model and data collection to maximize long-term improvement. For example, can the model learn to ask good questions that will teach it new skills? How quickly do models plateau with continual learning?

- Applying insights gained to other modalities like vision, speech, robotics etc. to develop general techniques for continual learning of intelligent agents interacting with the world.

- Continuing work on safety and responsible AI as these models become more capable. Ensuring benign behavior and mitigating potential harms remains crucial.

So in summary, the key directions are: improving via human feedback, robustness to noisy data, optimizing learning, expanding to new modalities, and maintaining responsible AI. The overall goal is developing agents that can continually learn to be helpful, harmless, and honest.
