# BlenderBot 3: a deployed conversational agent that continually learns to   responsibly engage

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we build dialogue agents that continue to improve from interactions with real users after deployment, in a responsible way?The authors aim to construct an open-domain conversational agent called BlenderBot 3 that is deployed publicly, collects natural conversational data from users, and can learn continually from that data in order to improve over time. A critical part of the research program is studying how to learn responsibly from the collected data, including being robust to noisy or adversarial inputs.The main hypotheses appear to be:1) Deploying the agent publicly and learning from natural user interactions will provide better training data that matches real user needs and interests, compared to static datasets.2) Continual learning methods can be developed that allow the agent to effectively learn from the interaction data in an online setting, to continually improve over time after deployment.  3) Learning algorithms can be made robust to deal with noisy or adversarial inputs from some users, so that model improvements are reliable.The paper seems focused on presenting the BlenderBot 3 model itself, its training and deployment, and the authors' plan to study continual learning from the collected conversations and release updates. Initial work on learning from conversational feedback and safe learning are presented in companion papers.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

This paper introduces BlenderBot 3 (BB3), a large open-domain conversational agent with the following main features and contributions:- The BB3 model itself, which is a 175B parameter transformer model fine-tuned on various conversational tasks using a modular and controllable framework. It builds on previous work like BlenderBot 1, BlenderBot 2, and SeeKeR.- Details of training BB3 on human feedback to improve skills like internet search and knowledge grounding, using a new dataset called FITS. This is described more fully in a companion paper by Xu et al. (2022).- A publicly accessible demo deployment of BB3 to collect natural conversations with users. The interface provides mechanisms for users to give feedback to the model.- Methods for continual learning from user interactions in a robust way, handling issues like adversarial users. This is covered more fully in a companion paper by Ju et al. (2022).- Evaluations showing BB3 outperforming existing openly available conversational agents on metrics like engagingness, knowledgeability, and safety.- Public release of the BB3 model weights, code, datasets, and publications to enable open and reproducible research on improving conversational agents through interaction.In summary, the main contribution is presenting BlenderBot 3 as an openly accessible conversational agent, its training methodology, deployment strategy, evaluation, and commitment to release artifacts to further research in this area. The goal is to study continually improving responsible AI agents.
