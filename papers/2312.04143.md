# [Towards 4D Human Video Stylization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04143)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for 4D (3D and time) stylization of human-centric videos that enables stylized rendering of both novel views and animated humans. The key innovation is the use of dual Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to simultaneously represent the human subject and surrounding scene. This allows stylization to be performed in the rendered NeRF feature space, inherently preserving multi-view consistency while gaining the capacity for view and pose manipulation. Specifically, a human body model warp facilitates optimization of the human NeRF in a canonical pose space to enable subsequent animation. Meanwhile, the scene is modeled as static background across frames. Additionally, a new geometry-guided tri-plane feature representation is introduced to enhance learning within the NeRF models. This involves encoding voxel coordinates as a geometric prior to help optimize robust feature representations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate superior stylization quality and temporal coherence compared to state-of-the-art video stylization methods. Moreover, the unique capability for flexible novel view and pose synthesis with stylization is showcased. The unified framework efficiently combines the strengths of video stylization, novel view synthesis, and controllable human animation for advanced creative editing of real-world videos.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper presents a unified framework for 4D human video stylization that allows stylizing novel views of animated humans in dynamic scenes given a monocular video and arbitrary style image.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1) It proposes a video stylization framework for dynamic scenes that can stylize novel views and animated humans in novel poses, given a monocular video and arbitrary style images. This is the first 4D video stylization approach based on neural radiance fields.

2) It introduces a tri-plane based representation with a geometric prior to efficiently and effectively model the 3D scenes. This representation is more robust in feature learning compared to directly optimizing the tri-plane features.

3) Compared to existing methods, it shows superior performance in balancing stylized textures and temporal coherence. It also has the unique capability of conducting stylization on animated humans and novel views.

In summary, the key innovation is the proposed unified framework that addresses style transfer, novel view synthesis and human animation within one model for creative 4D human video stylization.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my analysis, some of the key terms and concepts associated with this paper include:

- 4D human video stylization: The paper aims to stylize human videos in 4 dimensions - 3D space and time. This allows stylizing videos with novel views and poses over time.

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs): The method represents videos using NeRFs which encode a scene in a volumetric, continuous manner allowing rendering from arbitrary viewpoints.

- Dual NeRF representation: The scene background and human subject are modeled using two separate NeRFs to enable control over posing and animating the human. 

- Geometry-guided tri-plane representation: An efficient representation for learning NeRF features by projecting 3D coordinates onto three axis-aligned planes. A geometric prior is introduced to enable robust feature learning.

- Stylization in feature space: Stylization is performed in the NeRF rendered feature space using an arbitrary style image. This avoids using predicted RGB values as input to stylization.

- Novel view and pose synthesis: Key capability of the method to creatively stylize novel views around the subject and animate the human in new poses.

- Temporal consistency: Maintaining coherence of stylization across video frames without flicker or artifacts.

In summary, the core ideas relate to 4D stylization, NeRF scene modeling, feature space stylization, and flexible viewpoint/pose manipulation - all while preserving temporal consistency.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1) How does the proposed dual NeRF representation for the human subject and surrounding scene facilitate animation of the human across various poses and novel viewpoints? What are the specific advantages compared to using a single NeRF?

2) What modifications were made to the standard NeRF formulation to enable it to effectively model dynamic scenes featuring a moving person? How does the use of the SMPL model and error-correction network assist with this?

3) How does the proposed geometry-guided tri-plane representation enhance the feature learning capability and improve results compared to directly optimizing tri-plane features? What is the intuition behind encoding geometry priors on the tri-plane?  

4) What considerations were made in terms of network architecture and objective functions to optimize the trade-off between high-quality stylized textures and temporal coherence in the rendered outputs?

5) The method performs stylization directly in the NeRF feature space rather than on rendered RGB values. What are the advantages of this approach? How does it differ from alternative ways to accomplish stylized novel view and animation?

6) How does the proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively compare to state-of-the-art video stylization methods? What metrics were used to evaluate consistency across frames?

7) What are some limitations of the current method in terms of camera pose variation, computational efficiency, and balance between stylization quality and consistency? How can future work address these?

8) Aside from user studies, what other perceptual metrics could be used to evaluate the stylization quality on humans and environments? How can distortion of semantic content be quantified?  

9) How can the framework be extended to extrapolate beyond the observed camera poses and human appearances to enable more expansive novel views and animations?

10) What other scene representations beyond NeRF could this model-based stylization approach be applied to? How may other 3D formats be adapted to this framework?


## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem Statement:
Existing video style transfer methods can stylize input video frames but are limited to the viewpoints in the original video. They lack capabilities for novel view synthesis and animating humans in different poses. On the other hand, neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been used for stylized novel view synthesis of static scenes, but directly applying them to dynamic human videos is challenging. 

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a unified framework that can stylize the original video, as well as generate stylized novel views of humans in different poses. The key ideas are:

1) Simultaneously model the human subject and surrounding scene using two separate NeRFs. This allows animating the human while keeping the scene static.

2) Introduce a geometry-guided tri-plane scene representation, which is more efficient than MLPs in NeRF and learns better features. 

3) Conduct stylization in the NeRF feature space using an arbitrary style image, avoiding RGB prediction. This gives better consistency than using predicted RGB frames as input to video stylizers.

4) Use a lightweight decoder instead of an image encoder, enhancing efficiency.

Main Contributions:

- First framework to accomplish stylized novel view and animation of humans from monocular video input. Uniquely combines capabilities of video stylization and novel view synthesis.

- Geometry-guided tri-plane scene representation that encodes coordinates as a prior to learn better features across space.

- Superior stylization quality and temporal coherence compared to state-of-the-art video/NeRF stylization methods.

- Efficient feature-space stylization and lightweight decoder, avoiding costly components like image encoders.

In summary, this paper presents a pioneering 4D stylization approach for human-centric videos, with the ability to creatively manipulate viewpoints and poses while preserving stylization quality and coherence. The proposed ideas help tackle key limitations of existing methods.
