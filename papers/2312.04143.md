## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a novel method for 4D (3D and time) stylization of human-centric videos that enables stylized rendering of both novel views and animated humans. The key innovation is the use of dual Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to simultaneously represent the human subject and surrounding scene. This allows stylization to be performed in the rendered NeRF feature space, inherently preserving multi-view consistency while gaining the capacity for view and pose manipulation. Specifically, a human body model warp facilitates optimization of the human NeRF in a canonical pose space to enable subsequent animation. Meanwhile, the scene is modeled as static background across frames. Additionally, a new geometry-guided tri-plane feature representation is introduced to enhance learning within the NeRF models. This involves encoding voxel coordinates as a geometric prior to help optimize robust feature representations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate superior stylization quality and temporal coherence compared to state-of-the-art video stylization methods. Moreover, the unique capability for flexible novel view and pose synthesis with stylization is showcased. The unified framework efficiently combines the strengths of video stylization, novel view synthesis, and controllable human animation for advanced creative editing of real-world videos.
