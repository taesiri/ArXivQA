# [Verifiably Following Complex Robot Instructions with Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11498)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Enabling robots to follow complex natural language instructions is challenging. Such instructions may have ambiguous phrasing, intricate spatiotemporal constraints, and refer to arbitrary landmarks. Existing methods are limited to simple navigation instructions, rely on prespecified landmarks, or use LLMs directly for planning without verifiability. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes Language Instruction grounding for Motion Planning (LIMP) to address these limitations. LIMP leverages foundation models and temporal logics to generate instruction-conditioned semantic maps that enable robots to verifiably follow expressive instructions involving open-vocabulary referents and complex constraints.

Specifically, LIMP consists of three main modules:
1) A Language Instruction Module that translates instructions into linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications with a novel composable syntax that enables referent disambiguation. 
2) A Spatial Grounding Module that detects and localizes referents using visual language models and spatial reasoning.
3) A Task and Motion Planning Module that compiles LTL specifications into finite-state machines and uses dynamically generated semantic maps to progressively synthesize constraint-satisfying plans.

Main Contributions:
1) A composable LTL syntax that supports explainable representation of descriptive instructions and enables verifiable planning.

2) Algorithms for generating instruction-specific semantic maps that progressively guide robots through subgoals to satisfy complex instructions.

3) Demonstration of LIMP in three real-world environments across 35 instructions involving open-vocabulary referents and intricate spatiotemporal constraints. LIMP achieves 90% and 71% planning success rates on navigation and manipulation tasks respectively.

In summary, LIMP advances the state-of-the-art in instruction following by combining strengths of foundation models and formal methods to enable verifiable robot behavior for complex natural language commands.
