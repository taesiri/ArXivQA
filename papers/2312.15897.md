# [Recursive Distillation for Open-Set Distributed Robot Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15897)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Self-localization (classifying a view image into place classes) typically relies on supervised training data, which may not be available when a robot travels to new unfamiliar places. 
- Existing knowledge transfer (KT) schemes have limitations in handling open-set teachers that are uncooperative, untrainable (e.g. image retrieval engines), or black-box (unknown model, privacy concerns).

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce a data-free recursive distillation (DFRD) scheme where a student robot can ask teacher robots it encounters for guidance without needing their training data or models.
- Student reconstructs "pseudo" training data from teacher's outputs to train itself. Makes minimal assumptions on teacher models.
- Use a ranking function that converts softmax outputs to a regularized reciprocal rank feature (RRF) vector that works for black-box teachers.
- Once trained, student can join the open teacher set for next student. Enables continual learning under domain, class and vocabulary increments.

Experiments: 
- Evaluate on long-term robot navigation dataset with view images across different seasons (domains).
- Compare oracle (samples from teacher's data) vs random sampling, showing the RRF regularization helps prevent performance deterioration.
- Show student performance over recursive distillation generations, establishing feasibility of scheme.

Main Contributions:
- Propose a data-free recursive knowledge distillation scheme for open-set robot teachers
- Introduce reciprocal rank feature as interface for black-box teacher models
- Demonstrate scheme enables continual learning and maintains performance over recursion
