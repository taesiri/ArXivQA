# [Tackling Cyberattacks through AI-based Reactive Systems: A Holistic   Review and Future Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06229)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper presents a comprehensive survey and analysis of the current state of research on AI-based threat response systems in cybersecurity. It examines 22 recent papers from the past 5 years that integrate AI techniques into systems for responding to cyber threats. The survey analyzes each paper across 5 key features: methodology, algorithm, strategy objectives, measurements/results, and use cases. Based on a comparative analysis, the paper identifies several notable trends, including a predominance of machine learning and attack graphs as common methodologies and a focus on risk minimization as a key strategy objective. Additionally, positive rate emerges as the most prevalent evaluation metric. The survey also uncovers research gaps, such as a lack of standardized frameworks and countermeasure taxonomies. Through this in-depth exploration, the authors highlight opportunities and challenges for advancing AI-driven threat response capabilities. They outline promising future research directions centered on themes like collaborative AI, automated model updating, explainable AI interfaces, and countermeasure standardization. Overall, this paper delivers a cohesive, up-to-date overview of AI-based reaction systems while charting a roadmap for continued progress in this critical domain of cybersecurity.
