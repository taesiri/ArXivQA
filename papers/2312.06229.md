Problem:
With the exponential growth in use of information technology, cyber threats are also increasing rapidly. Both private and public entities need to strengthen their security systems to safeguard against data breaches, hacking, malware etc. AI is emerging as a powerful tool for cybersecurity, especially for threat detection, prevention and automated response. However, research on AI-driven intrusion response systems specifically is still evolving. There is a need to review the latest advancements in this area and analyze different AI-based reaction approaches to identify research gaps and future opportunities.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper conducts an extensive survey of 22 recent papers on AI-based reaction systems published over 2017-2022. It extracts 5 key features - Methodology, Algorithm, Strategy Objectives, Measurements & Results, and Use Case. It provides an overview and comparative analysis of the papers based on these common features to gain a cohesive understanding of the current research landscape. 

Key Findings:
- Machine learning and attack graphs are most widely used techniques
- Main objective is to minimize risk by selecting optimal countermeasures  
- Metrics like positive rate, countermeasure selection speed are frequently used
- Most solutions are generic rather than tailored to specific systems
- There is a lack of standardization in frameworks, countermeasures and evaluation

Main Contributions:
- First comprehensive analysis of AI-based reaction research over past 5 years
- Structured comparative framework with 5 key features for standardized analysis 
- Identifies research gaps like lack of collaboration, explainability, dynamism etc.
- Proposes 8 potential research challenges as future roadmap e.g. unified frameworks, evolutive AI models, knowledge exchange etc.
- Valuable for researchers and practitioners working on integrating AI into cybersecurity intrusion response

The paper makes a significant contribution by consolidating the latest advancements in this evolving field and outlining promising research directions that can guide future efforts towards more effective AI-powered defense mechanisms.
