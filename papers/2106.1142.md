# [Transition-Based Constrained DFT for the Robust and Reliable Treatment   of Excitations in Supramolecular Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.1142)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can constrained DFT be adapted to provide a robust and reliable approach for calculating excitation energies in large supramolecular systems? The key points I gathered are:- Calculating excitation energies for large systems is challenging. Existing methods like TDDFT are too computationally demanding, while ΔSCF and standard CDFT have limitations. - The authors introduce a new "transition-based" CDFT (T-CDFT) where the constraint corresponds to specific transitions between occupied and virtual orbitals.- They benchmark T-CDFT against TDDFT and ΔSCF for calculating singlet and triplet excitation energies of some model systems, including acenes and OLED emitters. - T-CDFT performs well across the board, providing accurate excitation energies for both local excitations (in acenes) and charge-transfer states (in OLEDs), unlike TDDFT which underestimates CT energies.- T-CDFT is also more robust and cheaper than TDDFT. Importantly, it's implemented in a linear-scaling DFT code suitable for large systems.So in summary, the central hypothesis is that T-CDFT can provide a robust method for modeling excitations in large supramolecular systems, overcoming limitations of existing methods. The results support this claim.
