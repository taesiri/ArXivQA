# [Semi-supervised Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16013)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Semi-supervised Open-World Object Detection":

Problem:
The paper addresses the problem of open-world object detection (OWOD), where the model is trained to detect both known objects it has seen before as well as unknown objects it has not encountered during training. Current OWOD methods rely heavily on an oracle (human annotator) to provide full annotations for the unknown objects at test time in order to incrementally learn them. This is laborious, time-consuming and less realistic. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a new Semi-supervised Open-World Object Detection (SS-OWOD) formulation to reduce the annotation cost. A novel transformer-based model called SS-OWFormer is introduced that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to learn new unknown objects incrementally. This is achieved via two main contributions:

1. A feature alignment scheme to effectively align representations between original and augmented images to exploit unlabeled data.

2. An object query guided pseudo-labeling scheme that captures multi-scale spatial information from both encoder and decoder features to better distinguish unknown objects.  

The model detects knowns, unknowns and incrementally learns unknowns using limited annotations in subsequent tasks without forgetting past knowledge.

Experiments and Results:
Comprehensive experiments on COCO demonstrate SS-OWFormer requires only 50% labeled data to match state-of-the-art OW-DETR which uses full supervision. With 10% labeled data, it outperforms OW-DETR (50% labeled data) on all metrics. For unknown objects, it achieves 4.8% better recall over OW-DETR. Experiments are also conducted on satellite images, where SS-OWOD is even more relevant due to annotation complexity.

To summarize, this paper introduces a more practical SS-OWOD formulation to reduce annotation cost by effectively utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data for open-world detection. The proposed SS-OWFormer model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
