# [SSTA: Salient Spatially Transformed Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07258)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method called Salient Spatially Transformed Attack (SSTA) that generates imperceptible adversarial examples (AEs) by estimating a smooth spatial transform on only the most critical (salient) region of the image. Unlike noise-adding attacks that distort the whole image, SSTA spatially transforms the salient region to craft AEs that are more stealthy and akin to the original image. Specifically, SSTA extracts a salient region mask and calculates an optimal flow field to spatially transform the salient area to generate AEs. It constrains the flow field to ensure imperceptibility. Experiments on ImageNet datasets demonstrate that SSTA can effectively improve AE inconspicuousness while maintaining 100% attack success, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Quantitative metrics and human perceptual studies show SSTA AEs are highly similar to originals and hard for humans to distinguish. By generating stealthy AEs without adding noise, SSTA provides an efficient way to evaluate classifier robustness. The spatial transform approach is a promising direction for building robust models.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method called Salient Spatially Transformed Attack (SSTA) that generates imperceptible adversarial examples by estimating a smooth spatial transform metric on the most critical area of an image rather than adding external noise across the whole image.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is proposing a novel non-noise additional attack method called Salient Spatially Transformed Attack (SSTA). Specifically, SSTA combines performing spatial transformation in salient regions extracted by object detection methods with optimizing a flow field to generate imperceptible adversarial examples. Key advantages highlighted in the paper are:

1) SSTA generates adversarial examples by transforming the salient region rather than directly adding noise to the entire image. This makes the perturbations more inconspicuous and harmonious with the original image. 

2) Experiments show SSTA can achieve 100% attack success rate while having higher image quality and similarity to the original image compared to state-of-the-art attack baselines. 

3) A human perceptual study with over 1000 annotations indicates adversarial examples generated by SSTA are very difficult for humans to distinguish from original images, with 88.98% of examples considered unmodified.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an improved approach over existing methods to craft imperceptible adversarial examples that are stealthier, maintain high attack performance, and are indistinguishable to humans.

The paper proposes a new attack method called "Salient Spatially Transformed Attack (SSTA)" to generate imperceptible adversarial examples by applying spatial transformations to the salient regions of images rather than adding noise across the whole image. Key ideas include extracting salient regions, calculating flow fields to spatially transform these regions, and formulating objective functions to balance attack success and visual imperceptibility. The key terms and keywords reflect this focus on imperceptible adversarial attacks using spatial transforms on salient image regions.
