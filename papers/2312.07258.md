# [SSTA: Salient Spatially Transformed Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07258)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a novel adversarial attack method called Salient Spatially Transformed Attack (SSTA) that generates imperceptible adversarial examples (AEs) by estimating a smooth spatial transform on only the most critical (salient) region of the image. Unlike noise-adding attacks that distort the whole image, SSTA spatially transforms the salient region to craft AEs that are more stealthy and akin to the original image. Specifically, SSTA extracts a salient region mask and calculates an optimal flow field to spatially transform the salient area to generate AEs. It constrains the flow field to ensure imperceptibility. Experiments on ImageNet datasets demonstrate that SSTA can effectively improve AE inconspicuousness while maintaining 100% attack success, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Quantitative metrics and human perceptual studies show SSTA AEs are highly similar to originals and hard for humans to distinguish. By generating stealthy AEs without adding noise, SSTA provides an efficient way to evaluate classifier robustness. The spatial transform approach is a promising direction for building robust models.
