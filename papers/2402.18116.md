# [Block and Detail: Scaffolding Sketch-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18116)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Block and Detail: Scaffolding Sketch-to-Image Generation":

Problem:
Existing sketch-to-image generation tools do not fully support the iterative process artists use to create drawings, where they start with blocking strokes to roughly indicate composition and proportions, and progressively add detail strokes to refine shapes. These tools either conform too tightly to all strokes, or disregard blocking strokes. They also treat empty space in sketches as whitespace rather than unfinished content. 

Solution:
The paper presents a sketch-to-image tool aligned with artists' workflow. Users can mark strokes as blocking or detail. A two-pass algorithm generates images that loosely follow blocking strokes while tightly matching detail strokes. First, a "ControlNet" produces an image matching all strokes. Then, a "blended renoising" stage adds controlled variation to regions surrounding blocking strokes. Adherence is governed by intuitive dilation radius parameters rather than opaque strength values. 

The tool also uses a ControlNet trained on purposefully partial edge maps to suggest content in blank areas. This aids iteration by offering completions and variations for users to build on.

Main Contributions:
1) A sketching interface supporting explicit blocking and detail strokes
2) A two-pass algorithm for loose blocking control and tight detail matching 
3) ControlNet training scheme enabling generation from partial sketches
4) Demonstrated iterative sketch walkthroughs where system suggestions scaffold composition development

The interface and algorithm align the tool with artists' workflow, facilitating progressive refinement of images where system outputs provide feedback to guide next sketching steps. Training for partial sketch awareness further aids this by offering completions for sparse drawings.
