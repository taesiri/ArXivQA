# [Hierarchical Prior-based Super Resolution for Point Cloud Geometry   Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11250)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
The paper focuses on geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), which is being standardized by MPEG. In the lossy mode of G-PCC, the reconstructed point cloud often suffers from noticeable distortions due to naive geometry quantization (grid downsampling). Existing learning-based methods exhibit good rate-distortion performance but have high complexity. Post-processing methods like SRLUT can reduce distortions without increasing bitrate but their rate-distortion optimization is suboptimal.

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a hierarchical prior-based super resolution (HPSR-PCGC) method for point cloud geometry compression. The key ideas are:

1) Construct a content-dependent hierarchical prior at the encoder by successively downsampling the point cloud into a pyramid, and performing neighborhood-based clustering and frequency-based occupancy estimation. 

2) The hierarchical prior captures dependencies and patterns within the point cloud across scales. It serves as side information to enable coarse-to-fine super resolution at the decoder.

3) Balance the rate allocated to the base point cloud and hierarchical prior. More accurate prior gives better reconstruction but requires more bits to encode.

Main Contributions:

1) A principled framework to trade off rate and distortion for point cloud geometry compression via hierarchical prior-based super resolution.

2) Significantly outperforms anchor G-PCC method in terms of BD-Rate savings across point clouds with varying densities, while having comparable complexity.

3) Closes the performance gap with other state-of-the-art methods like V-PCC and learning-based techniques for solid point clouds, while inheriting the efficiency of G-PCC.

4) Thorough experimentation and analysis on the MPEG standard dataset to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In summary, the paper makes notable contributions in improving G-PCC for lossy geometry compression through an efficient encoder-driven hierarchical prior-based super resolution approach.
