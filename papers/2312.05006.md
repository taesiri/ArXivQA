## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adverse weather image restoration method called DDCNet that decouples the degradation removal and content reconstruction processes at the feature level based on their channel statistics. It utilizes the amplitude component in the Fourier domain to generate channel-dependent conditional information to guide tailored degradation removal for various weather types. It also exploits the global characteristics of the Fourier domain for consistent channel-independent content reconstruction. Specifically, the degradation removal module uses the amplitude which mainly contains degradation cues to modulate features along the channel dimension. The content reconstruction module eliminates degradation influence by averaging features along channels and integrates Fourier's global properties for consistent reconstruction. Additionally, a degradation mapping loss is introduced to constrain the optimization direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple adverse weather benchmarks. The approach effectively handles the unique impact of different degradations while reconstructing the content uniformly. By decoupling these processes, it reduces the complexity for a unified network to manage multiple weather types.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem: 
Adverse weather image restoration aims to recover clear images from those affected by weather conditions like rain, haze, and snow. Different weather types necessitate tailored degradation removal approaches due to their unique image impacts. In contrast, content reconstruction can use a uniform approach as the underlying image content is consistent. Although existing techniques can handle multiple weather types in one network, they neglect this key distinction, limiting restoration quality.

Proposed Solution:
This paper proposes a new adverse weather image restoration method called DDCNet that decouples degradation removal and content reconstruction at the feature level based on channel statistics. 

It utilizes the Fourier transform's unique advantages in both processes:
1) Degradation information mainly lies in the Fourier amplitude. This facilitates channel-dependent degradation removal by modulating feature importance between channels, allowing tailored responses to weather types.  
2) Fourier's global properties integrated into channel-independent content features enhance network capacity for consistent global content reconstruction.

Additionally, a degradation mapping loss function is introduced to constrain the optimization direction of degradation removal.

Main Contributions:

1) Highlights tailored degradation removal and similar content reconstruction processes for various adverse weather types, reducing the complexity for a unified network.

2) Proposes channel-dependent degradation removal using degradation-related Fourier amplitude to generate conditional information for tailored responses.

3) Employs Fourier's global properties for channel-independent globally consistent content reconstruction.

4) Integrates a degradation mapping loss to further strengthen degradation removal.

5) Restores images of different weather types in a unified network, outperforming previous multi-task state-of-the-art methods.

In summary, the proposed DDCNet reduces the complexity of handling multiple weather types by decoupling tailored degradation removal and consistent content reconstruction. It leverages unique Fourier transform advantages in both processes and constraints via a degradation mapping loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple adverse weather benchmarks.
