## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel adverse weather image restoration method called DDCNet that decouples the degradation removal and content reconstruction processes at the feature level based on their channel statistics. It utilizes the amplitude component in the Fourier domain to generate channel-dependent conditional information to guide tailored degradation removal for various weather types. It also exploits the global characteristics of the Fourier domain for consistent channel-independent content reconstruction. Specifically, the degradation removal module uses the amplitude which mainly contains degradation cues to modulate features along the channel dimension. The content reconstruction module eliminates degradation influence by averaging features along channels and integrates Fourier's global properties for consistent reconstruction. Additionally, a degradation mapping loss is introduced to constrain the optimization direction. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple adverse weather benchmarks. The approach effectively handles the unique impact of different degradations while reconstructing the content uniformly. By decoupling these processes, it reduces the complexity for a unified network to manage multiple weather types.
