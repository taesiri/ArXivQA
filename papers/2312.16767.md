# [Adaptive Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding Using Bandit-Based Large   Neighborhood Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16767)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Adaptive Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding Using Bandit-Based Large Neighborhood Search":

Problem:
- Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) aims to find collision-free paths for multiple agents, and is important for applications like warehouse automation, disaster response, etc. 
- Anytime MAPF based on large neighborhood search (LNS) is a promising approach but suffers from two key limitations: (1) fixed neighborhood sizes limit flexibility and solution quality, requiring extensive tuning, (2) greedy optimization and lack of exploration due to the commonly used roulette wheel selection for destroy heuristics.

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes BALANCE, a bandit-based adaptive LNS framework for anytime MAPF. 
- It uses a bi-level multi-armed bandit scheme to adapt the selection of destroy heuristics and neighborhood sizes during search. The first level bandit selects destroy heuristics, the second level bandits condition on this to select neighborhood sizes.
- Reward is defined as the cost improvement over previous solutions. Three MAB algorithm instantiations are proposed and analyzed: roulette wheel, UCB1, and Thompson sampling.

Main Contributions:
- Formulation of BALANCE - an adaptive anytime MAPF method using a bi-level MAB scheme to address limitations of state-of-the-art methods.
- Analysis and comparison of different MAB algorithms (roulette wheel, UCB1 and Thompson sampling) for BALANCE.
- Extensive experiments on standard MAPF benchmarks demonstrating at least 50% cost improvement over state-of-the-art methods in large scenarios. 
- Key findings that sufficient neighborhood size options and use of Thompson sampling significantly impact performance.

In summary, the paper presents a novel bandit-based adaptive LNS approach for anytime MAPF that is simple, flexible and outperforms existing methods without needing extensive tuning or machine learning.
