## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel image inpainting approach called Aligned Stable Inpainting with Unknown Areas Prior (ASUKA) that balances fidelity and stability. ASUKA utilizes a frozen Stable Diffusion (SD) model for generation capacity while enhancing stability by incorporating guidance from a Masked Autoencoder (MAE). An alignment module is introduced to map the MAE prior to the latent space of SD. Further, ASUKA employs an specialized decoder that ensures consistency between generated content and unmasked regions. Experiments conducted on a new diverse evaluation dataset MISATO demonstrate ASUKA’s efficacy over SD variants and other inpainting methods. Both qualitative results and quantitative metrics like FID and human preference scores validate ASUKA’s ability to produce more stable and faithful inpainting compared to current state-of-the-art. The method emphasizes the importance of reconstruction-based guidance for generative inpainting to achieve enhanced stability without sacrificing quality or diversity.
