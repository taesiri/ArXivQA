# [AlteredAvatar: Stylizing Dynamic 3D Avatars with Fast Style Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19245)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we stylize dynamic 3D avatars to match arbitrary novel styles quickly and flexibly, while maintaining high visual quality, consistency across views/expressions, and preserving the original identity?The key points are:- The paper focuses on stylizing dynamic 3D avatars that can be rendered from novel views and expressions. This is important for VR/AR applications where avatars need to be animated and viewed from different angles. - The goal is to be able to match arbitrary new styles specified by a text description or image, not just styles seen during training. This requires generalization to novel styles.- They aim to balance three factors: (1) Speed of adaptation to new styles (2) Flexibility to adapt to arbitrary new styles (3) Visual quality of stylized results.- Consistency of the stylization across different views and expressions is important.- Preserving identity of the original avatar is also a goal.To achieve this balance, the paper proposes a meta-learning approach called AlteredAvatar that can quickly adapt avatar representations to new styles with a small number of update steps. This avoids slow optimization needed by previous methods while maintaining quality and consistency.So in summary, the core research question is how to achieve fast, flexible, and high-quality stylization of dynamic 3D avatars for novel styles while maintaining identity/consistency. AlteredAvatar is proposed to address this question.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is presenting a method called AlteredAvatar that can quickly adapt dynamic 3D avatars to match arbitrary stylistic descriptions, whether given as text, an image, or both. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing a meta-learning approach to learn a dynamic 3D avatar representation that can rapidly adapt to novel styles with just a few update steps. This strikes a balance between flexibility, speed, and quality.- Demonstrating that using CLIP features provides an expressive way to guide avatar stylization based on semantic text descriptions, style reference images, or both. This enables intuitive control over the target style.- Showing that AlteredAvatar can generate consistent stylized avatars across different views and expressions, while maintaining the ability to animate the avatar.- Comparing to other text-guided and image-guided stylization methods qualitatively and quantitatively, and highlighting the advantages of AlteredAvatar in terms of generalization to novel styles, identity/expression preservation, and view consistency.In summary, the main contribution is a new meta-learning based approach for fast adaptation of dynamic 3D avatars to arbitrary target styles specified by text, image or both. This makes avatar stylization more flexible, efficient and semantically controllable.
