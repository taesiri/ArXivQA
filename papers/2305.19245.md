# [AlteredAvatar: Stylizing Dynamic 3D Avatars with Fast Style Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19245)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading, the central research question this paper addresses is: How can we stylize dynamic 3D avatars to match arbitrary novel styles quickly and flexibly, while maintaining high visual quality, consistency across views/expressions, and preserving the original identity?The key points are:- The paper focuses on stylizing dynamic 3D avatars that can be rendered from novel views and expressions. This is important for VR/AR applications where avatars need to be animated and viewed from different angles. - The goal is to be able to match arbitrary new styles specified by a text description or image, not just styles seen during training. This requires generalization to novel styles.- They aim to balance three factors: (1) Speed of adaptation to new styles (2) Flexibility to adapt to arbitrary new styles (3) Visual quality of stylized results.- Consistency of the stylization across different views and expressions is important.- Preserving identity of the original avatar is also a goal.To achieve this balance, the paper proposes a meta-learning approach called AlteredAvatar that can quickly adapt avatar representations to new styles with a small number of update steps. This avoids slow optimization needed by previous methods while maintaining quality and consistency.So in summary, the core research question is how to achieve fast, flexible, and high-quality stylization of dynamic 3D avatars for novel styles while maintaining identity/consistency. AlteredAvatar is proposed to address this question.
