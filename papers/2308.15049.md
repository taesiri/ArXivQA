# [Pose-Free Neural Radiance Fields via Implicit Pose Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15049)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How to train an effective neural radiance field (NeRF) model using a set of unposed (without known camera poses) multi-view images?The key hypothesis is that introducing an implicit pose regularization technique can promote the robustness of the pose estimator for real images, thus avoiding local minima during joint optimization of the NeRF model and predicted camera poses.In summary, the paper aims to develop a pose-free NeRF method that can be trained effectively on unposed images by introducing a novel implicit pose regularization approach.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

The main contribution of this paper is proposing IR-NeRF, an innovative pose-free neural radiance field method that introduces implicit pose regularization to refine the pose estimator using unposed real images. This improves the robustness of the pose estimator for real images and prevents the joint optimization of the NeRF and predicted poses from falling into local minima. Specifically, the key contributions are:- Proposing IR-NeRF, a novel pose-free NeRF method that uses implicit pose regularization to enable effective NeRF training with unposed multi-view images.- Constructing a scene codebook from multi-view images that encodes scene features and captures scene-specific pose distribution implicitly as priors. - Designing a pose-guided view reconstruction scheme using the scene priors to refine the pose estimator with unposed real images. This improves the robustness of pose estimation.- Demonstrating through experiments that IR-NeRF achieves superior novel view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real datasets.In summary, the key innovation is using implicit pose regularization to refine the pose estimator with real images, leveraging scene priors captured in the codebook. This allows IR-NeRF to optimize NeRF effectively from unposed images.
