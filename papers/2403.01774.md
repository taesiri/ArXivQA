# [WebCiteS: Attributed Query-Focused Summarization on Chinese Web Search   Results with Citations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01774)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Enhancing attribution in large language models (LLMs) is important for reducing risks like hallucination and improving credibility. One approach is enabling LLMs to cite external sources supporting their generations. 
- However, existing datasets and evaluation methods for training and assessing the attribution abilities of LLMs have limitations:
    - Most datasets lack high-quality citation annotations
    - Evaluation methods cannot thoroughly assess attribution - they don't differentiate between groundedness errors and citation errors, and cannot handle sentences drawing partial support from multiple sources

Proposed Solution:
- Present WebCiteS, a Chinese dataset with 7k human-annotated summaries with citations, derived from real-world user queries and web search results
    - Adopt a human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline to ensure quality
- Propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that distinguishes groundedness and citation quality, and incorporates a claim-split model to detect partial support
- Develop an automatic evaluator aligned with human citations  

Main Contributions:
- Formulate the task of attributed query-focused summarization (AQFS)  
- Construct the WebCiteS dataset which offers real-world queries, search results as documents, and high-quality human annotations of summaries and citations
- Put forward detailed evaluation metrics and optimized automatic evaluator for assessing the attribution abilities of LLMs  
- Conduct comprehensive experiments on WebCiteS using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, revealing remaining challenges LLMs face in attribution

The key significance is developing a valuable benchmark to facilitate research towards enhancing and evaluating the attribution capacities of LLMs. Findings also showcase the difficulty LLMs have with accurate citations even if grounded, and declining performance as context length increases.
