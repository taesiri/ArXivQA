# [Investigating Answerability of LLMs for Long-Form Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08210)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: 

How to build a deeper understanding of the gaps in capabilities between massive LLMs like ChatGPT and smaller yet effective open-source LLMs and their distilled counterparts?

In particular, the authors aim to investigate the reasoning capabilities and performance differences between these types of models in long-form question answering. 

The key hypotheses appear to be:

1) Generating follow-up questions from document summaries rather than original documents will create a more challenging setup that requires deeper reasoning abilities from the LLMs.

2) Massive models like ChatGPT will outperform smaller open-source models like Alpaca and LLaMA on this proposed evaluation method, especially for longer contexts.

3) The performance gaps will be more pronounced on the authors' proposed question generation method compared to existing LFQA benchmarks.

So in summary, the central research question is around unveiling the limitations and understanding the gaps between different classes of LLMs, especially on long-form QA where reasoning over longer contexts is required, using the authors' proposed method of generating complex follow-up questions from document summaries.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper seems to be proposing a new evaluation methodology for studying the capabilities of large language models on long-form question answering. Specifically, the key ideas are:

1. Generating follow-up questions from abstractive summaries of long documents rather than directly from the documents. The motivation is that questions generated from summaries require deeper reasoning to link information across the full document context.

2. Using GPT-4 to automatically evaluate the quality of answers generated by LLMs on metrics like coherence, relevance, factual consistency and accuracy. Prior work has shown GPT-4 correlates well with human evaluation on long-form text generation tasks.

3. Comparing massive LLMs like ChatGPT with smaller yet effective open-source LLMs like Alpaca and LLaMA using this evaluation setup. The results reveal noticeable gaps in the reasoning and inference capabilities required for the question answering task, especially for the smaller models.

4. The analysis also uncovers interesting findings around the reliance on context, impact of model size, performance on different metrics, and sensitivity to longer contexts.

In summary, the key contribution appears to be the proposed evaluation methodology to gain a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities on long-form QA through automatic question generation and evaluation. The results reveal limitations of existing models, especially smaller open-source LLMs, in complex reasoning over long documents.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a new evaluation method for analyzing the performance gaps between large language models like ChatGPT and smaller open-source models on long-form question answering by generating complex follow-up questions from document summaries and evaluating the quality of generated answers with GPT-4 across multiple metrics.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel methodology for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on long-form question answering. Some key aspects that differentiate it from prior work:

- Focus on long-form QA: Much existing research has focused more on short answer QA datasets like SQuAD. Evaluating capabilities on long-form QA is an open challenge, and this work makes strides in that direction.

- Question generation from summaries: The authors propose generating follow-up questions from document summaries rather than original texts. This creates a harder test for reasoning/inference as models must link scattered pieces across the full document. Unique approach not explored before.

- Leveraging GPT-4 for evaluation: Using GPT-4 for automated scoring/evaluation is a relatively new technique. Most prior work relied more on human evaluation or metrics like ROUGE which may be less suitable for long texts. Analysis shows high correlation between GPT-4 and human scores.

- Analysis of commercial vs open source models: Provides useful insights into limitations of smaller open source models like Alpaca. Most analysis has focused on massive commercial models like ChatGPT. Understanding tradeoffs is valuable.

- Focus on reasoning: Many recent analysis highlight limitations of surface-level language mastery. The proposed methodology better tests deeper reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Overall, this paper pushes forward the understanding of LLM capabilities for an underexplored but important genre of long-form QA. The novel question generation strategy and leveraging of large LMs for evaluation are innovative contributions. Findings reveal gaps that highlight opportunities for continued progress in reasoning and inference for generative QA tasks.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, here are some of the future research directions suggested by the authors:

- Developing better long-form text generation capabilities for smaller LLMs. The authors found that smaller models like Alpaca struggled to generate satisfactory answers compared to massive models like ChatGPT, especially for longer contexts and questions generated from summaries. Improving long-form text generation for smaller models is an important area for future work.

- Studying when and how to best utilize context in constrained sequence length settings. The authors found surprising results showing Alpaca performed better without context on questions directly from the passage. More analysis is needed on when providing additional context is helpful or not in limited sequence length scenarios.

- Evaluating model performance on different domains of text. The authors suggest analyzing if models perform better or worse on certain domains based on their training data. Expanding the diversity of domains could reveal more insights.

- Mitigating limitations of using LLMs like ChatGPT and GPT-4 for question generation and evaluation. The authors acknowledge concerns around potential bias or fabrication. Exploring alternative evaluation methods is an area for future improvement. 

- Expanding human evaluation on a larger scale. Due to cost, human evaluation was limited in this work. Scaling up human studies could provide further validation and reveal additional insights.

- Studying the impact of different training distributions, methods and model sizes. The authors note that discrepancies in training data make comparing LLMs challenging. More controlled experiments on model training could be illuminating.

In summary, the authors propose several promising directions such as improving long-form text generation for smaller models, better utilizing context, evaluating different domains, mitigating biases in auto-evaluation, expanding human studies, and analyzing model training - to further advance understanding of LLMs.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new evaluation method for studying the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on long-form question answering. The key idea is to generate complex follow-up questions based on abstractive summaries of long documents, which requires the model to link information across the full document context. The authors prompt ChatGPT to generate questions from summaries and evaluate the quality of answers from ChatGPT and other open-source LLMs using GPT-4 across metrics like coherence, relevance, factual consistency, and accuracy. Their analysis reveals several findings: (1) Questions generated from summaries require referring to longer context and multiple passes, confirming they are more challenging. (2) Open-source models like Alpaca rely less on context for questions from the original text but struggle on questions from summaries, especially for longer contexts. (3) Alpaca can generate coherent but drifting, repetitive, and partially correct answers. (4) Alpaca also degrades rapidly on contexts exceeding 1024 tokens. Overall, the proposed evaluation method exposes limitations of smaller open-source LLMs compared to massive models like ChatGPT on reasoning over long contexts.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new evaluation method for analyzing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in long-form question answering (LFQA). LFQA is an important yet understudied challenge, with applications like troubleshooting and customer service. The authors generate complex follow-up questions from abstractive summaries of long documents using ChatGPT prompts. They hypothesize that answering such questions requires deeper reasoning across the full document context. 

To evaluate different LLMs, the authors design prompts for the powerful GPT-4 model to score the coherence, relevance, factual consistency and accuracy of generated answers. Their analysis reveals significant gaps between massive models like ChatGPT versus smaller open-source LLMs like Alpaca and Llama. The smaller LLMs struggle with the complex questions from summaries, especially for longer contexts. The paper demonstrates that prompting ChatGPT for question generation from summaries, paired with GPT-4 evaluation, provides a scalable method to analyze LLM capabilities for challenging LFQA.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes a new evaluation method for analyzing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on long-form question answering (LFQA). The key idea is to generate complex follow-up questions from abstractive summaries of long documents, rather than directly from the documents themselves. To do this, the authors first collect long passages from Wikipedia and have ChatGPT generate abstractive summaries. They then prompt ChatGPT again to generate top-3 complex questions from each summary that would require reasoning across the full document context to answer. This question generation process creates a challenging LFQA dataset requiring deeper understanding and inference. To evaluate, the authors generate free-form answers using various LLMs and rate them with GPT-4 on coherence, relevance, factual consistency and accuracy. The main findings are that questions generated from summaries are more difficult, and LLMs, especially smaller ones, struggle with answering them satisfactorily compared to questions directly from documents. Overall, the proposed evaluation methodology provides a way to test reasoning over long contexts and uncover performance gaps between massive and smaller LLMs.
