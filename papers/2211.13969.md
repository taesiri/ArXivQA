# [Unsupervised Continual Semantic Adaptation through Neural Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13969)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 The central research question addressed in this paper is how to continually adapt a semantic segmentation model to new scenes in an unsupervised fashion, while preventing catastrophic forgetting on previous scenes. 

Specifically, the authors propose using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to fuse the predictions of a segmentation model from multiple viewpoints into a 3D representation for each scene. The rendered semantic labels from the NeRF act as pseudo-labels to adapt the segmentation model on the new scene. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, the compact NeRF models are stored in a long-term memory and used to render images and pseudo-labels from previous scenes, which are mixed with data from the current scene during training.

The key hypothesis is that the view-consistent pseudo-labels rendered from the NeRF models can be used to effectively adapt the segmentation model to new scenes without ground truth supervision, while the compact scene representations stored in long-term memory can help mitigate catastrophic forgetting in a continual learning setup across multiple scenes.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a method to continually adapt a semantic segmentation model to new scenes in an unsupervised fashion using neural rendering. Specifically, the paper trains a Semantic Neural Radiance Field (Semantic-NeRF) model on each new scene to generate view-consistent pseudo-labels, which are then used to adapt the segmentation model. 

2. Demonstrating that jointly training the Semantic-NeRF model and the segmentation model through iterative mutual supervision improves performance on the pseudo-labels and the segmentation predictions. This shows the benefit of enforcing 2D-3D knowledge transfer between the frame-level predictions and the scene-level 3D representation.

3. Introducing a NeRF-based experience replay strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting when adapting the model continually across multiple scenes. The compactness of NeRF allows storing the models for previous scenes in a long-term memory to generate data for replay from novel viewpoints at constant memory cost.

4. Evaluating the method on the ScanNet dataset and showing improved adaptation performance compared to baselines, including a recent voxel-based method and a state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation approach. The evaluations also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NeRF-based replay strategy at retaining knowledge.

In summary, the key novelty is in exploiting neural rendering to enable unsupervised adaptation and experience replay for continual learning of semantic segmentation across multiple scenes, and demonstrating through experiments the advantages compared to existing approaches. The introduced 2D-3D knowledge transfer and ability to generate data from novel views are also notable contributions.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

 Here is a one sentence summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes using neural radiance fields to fuse semantic segmentation predictions from multiple viewpoints into a consistent 3D representation, which is then used to render pseudo-labels for adapting the segmentation network to new scenes in a continual learning fashion, while compactly storing past scenes in memory to prevent catastrophic forgetting.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 Here are my thoughts on how this paper compares to other related work in semantic segmentation adaptation:

- The problem setting of continual semantic adaptation is novel compared to much prior work. As discussed, UDA methods typically focus on single-stage adaptation between source and target domains, while continual learning tackles class-incremental scenarios. This paper introduces a new multi-stage adaptation setting that is relevant for real-world deployment.

- The idea of using 3D fusion to generate pseudo-labels for unsupervised adaptation has similarities to some recent UDA methods, like CBST. However, using neural rendering with NeRFs for this purpose is new. NeRF allows enforcing multi-view consistency in a differentiable way during training.

- Leveraging NeRF models for replay and generating novel views for adaptation is a very interesting idea not explored before. It provides a way to continually adapt at constant memory cost while retaining past knowledge.

- Jointly training the 2D segmentation network and 3D NeRF scene representation enables implicit knowledge transfer between them. Showing improved adaptation performance from this 2D-3D co-training is a nice result.

- Comparisons to related UDA and continual learning methods like CoTTA and the voxel-based approach demonstrate the advantages of the proposed NeRF-based approach. Both adaptation performance and memory efficiency are improved.

Overall, I would say the main novelties are in the problem formulation, using NeRF for pseudo-label generation/replay, and showing benefits of joint 2D-3D training. The ideas seem promising for semantic segmentation adaptation in real-world systems. Limitations like handling dynamic scenes are also discussed.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions the authors suggest include:

- Evaluating the method on more challenging datasets with outdoor scenes, complex lighting conditions, and dynamic objects. The current experiments are on indoor ScanNet scenes. Testing on more complex real-world data could reveal limitations.

- Exploring more sophisticated strategies for selecting novel viewpoints to render from previous scenes for experience replay. The authors show that novel views improve retention of past knowledge, so designing replay strategies tailored to each scene could further boost performance. 

- Using regularization techniques like entropy minimization to avoid "collapse" cases where poor reconstructions and inconsistent predictions degrade performance. This could make the approach more robust.

- Extending the pipeline to handle dynamic scenes by incorporating temporally-aware Neural Radiance Fields. The current method assumes static scenes. Modeling scene dynamics could broaden the applicability.

- Investigating alternatives to aggregating predictions from the 2D segmentation network into the 3D scene representation. The authors use Semantic NeRF currently, but other 3D representations could be explored.

- Studying the interplay between 2D and 3D predictions further to understand how to maximize positive mutually beneficial knowledge transfer between them.

- Evaluating the approach on real-world physical systems like robots to study its applicability in authentic deployed settings and reveal challenges.

So in summary, the main directions are handling more complex environments, designing better experience replay strategies, improving robustness, incorporating dynamics, exploring alternative 3D representations, maximizing 2D-3D knowledge transfer, and testing on physical systems. Advancing along these lines could strengthen the method and broaden its applicability.

## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

The paper proposes a method for continually adapting a semantic segmentation network across multiple scenes in an unsupervised fashion using neural rendering. The key idea is to leverage neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to fuse the segmentation predictions from multiple viewpoints into a consistent 3D scene representation. For each new scene, a Semantic-NeRF model is trained using the predictions of the current segmentation network as pseudo-labels. The rendered semantic labels from this model are then used to adapt the segmentation network on the new scene. To enable continual adaptation across multiple scenes, the compact NeRF model for each scene is stored in a long-term memory. By rendering images and pseudo-labels from previous scenes and mixing them with data from the current scene, the method is able to reduce catastrophic forgetting. 

The proposed approach is evaluated on the ScanNet dataset for continual adaptation across 10 scenes. The results demonstrate that: (1) Using NeRFs to form pseudo-labels results in better adaptation performance compared to a voxel-based approach; (2) Jointly training the segmentation network and NeRF enables mutual 2D-3D knowledge transfer and improves the predictions of both; (3) Storing compact NeRF scene representations allows generating infinite views for replay while requiring less memory than storing explicit images/labels or previous network weights. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively adapting the segmentation network to new scenes seen during deployment, while preventing catastrophic forgetting.

In summary, the key contributions are leveraging differentiable neural rendering to enable unsupervised adaptation and knowledge transfer between 2D and 3D, and using compact scene representations for efficient experience replay to counter forgetting. The method demonstrates promising results on semantic segmentation adaptation across multiple real-world indoor scenes.


## Summarize the main method used in the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the main method used in the paper:

The paper proposes using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to adapt a semantic segmentation model to new scenes in an unsupervised, continual fashion. For each new scene, they train a Semantic-NeRF model by fusing the predictions of the segmentation model from multiple viewpoints. This produces view-consistent pseudo-labels that are then used to adapt the segmentation model on the current scene through a cross-entropy loss. To enable continual adaptation across multiple scenes, after training on a scene the NeRF model is stored in a long-term memory. Renderings of images and pseudo-labels from previous scenes can then be mixed with data from the current scene to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. A key benefit is that the compact NeRF representation allows rendering an infinite number of views from each scene for adaptation. Furthermore, they show that jointly training the segmentation model and Semantic-NeRF through iterative mutual supervision improves performance on the current scene by enforcing 2D-3D consistency.


## What problem or question is the paper addressing?

 The paper is addressing the problem of continually adapting a semantic segmentation model to new scenes in an unsupervised fashion, without catastrophic forgetting of previous scenes. Specifically, it focuses on the scenario where a pre-trained segmentation model is deployed sequentially across multiple real-world indoor scenes, and needs to adapt to each new scene using only unlabeled data from that scene. The key challenges are 1) adapting the model to each new scene without ground truth labels, and 2) retaining performance on previous scenes as the model adapts to new data.

The main question the paper tries to answer is: how can we leverage neural rendering techniques like NeRF to continually adapt a semantic segmentation model in an unsupervised, multi-scene setting, while avoiding catastrophic forgetting?

In summary, the key problem is unsupervised and continual adaptation of a semantic segmentation model across multiple scenes, and the paper explores using neural rendering with NeRF as a solution.

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-level summary of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel method for continually adapting a semantic segmentation model to new scenes in an unsupervised manner, without requiring ground truth labels. The key idea is to leverage neural rendering techniques, specifically Semantic Neural Radiance Fields (Semantic-NeRF), to generate pseudo-labels for self-supervised adaptation. 

For each new scene, the authors first aggregate predictions from the segmentation network across multiple viewpoints into a Semantic-NeRF. This 3D representation enforces multi-view consistency and renders high-quality pseudo-labels. Critically, joint training of the segmentation network and Semantic-NeRF enables bidirectional knowledge transfer - the segmentation network predictions supervise the NeRF to reconstruct better geometry and semantics, while the rendered pseudo-labels in turn improve the segmentation network. 

To enable continual adaptation across multiple scenes, the compact NeRF models are stored in a long-term memory. Rendered views from previous scenes are used for experience replay to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. This replay strategy has constant memory cost and allows generating unlimited views for adaptation.

Experiments on ScanNet show the proposed method outperforms baselines in one-step and continual adaptation settings. The joint training strategy consistently improves both the pseudo-labels and segmentation network. Storing NeRF models for experience replay mitigates forgetting better than buffering previous data.

## Summarize the paper in one paragraphs.

 Here is a one paragraph summary:

This paper proposes a method for adapting a semantic segmentation network across multiple indoor scenes in a continual, unsupervised fashion using neural rendering. The key idea is that for each new scene, a Semantic NeRF model is trained to fuse the per-frame predictions of the segmentation network into a 3D representation. This NeRF model can then be used to render view-consistent pseudo-labels, which are used to adapt the segmentation network through a joint training procedure. To prevent catastrophic forgetting across scenes, the compact NeRF models are stored in a long-term memory and used to render images and labels from previous scenes that can be replayed when adapting to new scenes. Experiments on ScanNet demonstrate that the method outperforms baselines in terms of adaptation performance on new scenes and retention of knowledge on previous ones. A core benefit is enforcing semantic consistency through joint 2D-3D training with NeRF, and the compact storage of unlimited views per scene.
