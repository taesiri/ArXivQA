# [Evaluating the Rationale Understanding of Critical Reasoning in Logical   Reading Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18353)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a summary paragraph of the key points from the paper:

This paper presents a new dataset called RULE (rationale understanding for logical reasoning evaluation) to better evaluate language models' capability for critical reasoning in logical reading comprehension. The authors crowdsource free-form rationales explaining why each answer option should be selected or eliminated for existing multiple choice logical reasoning questions. These rationales are used to create over 3,000 additional subquestions associated with the 943 main questions from the ReClor dataset. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art large language models struggle to consistently answer the main questions and subquestions correctly, with at least a 30% gap compared to humans. Specifically, models perform much worse on eliminative subquestions about incorrect answer options compared to selective ones about correct options. This suggests models may simply be guessing correct answers without fully comprehending the underlying critical reasoning. Further analysis confirms models' deficiency in understanding eliminative rationales. The new dataset and methodology encourages future investigation into critical reasoning ability while explicitly testing the reasoning process behind selecting and eliminating relevant alternatives.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper presents a new logical reading comprehension dataset with over 3,000 auxiliary questions designed to test whether language models can consistently understand the underlying rationale for answering main multiple-choice questions correctly by selecting the right option and eliminating incorrect ones.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my understanding, the main contribution of this paper is:

The authors construct a new dataset called RULE (rationale understanding for logical reasoning evaluation) to evaluate language models' ability to consistently understand the rationale behind critical reasoning in logical reading comprehension. The key aspects of their contribution are:

1) They create over 3,000 auxiliary questions designed to test a model's capability to answer main logical reasoning questions from an existing dataset (ReClor) along with supporting rationale-based subquestions. 

2) They evaluate state-of-the-art models including large language models across various settings, showing even the best models fall short of human performance, particularly in understanding eliminative rationales that explain why incorrect answer options should be eliminated.

3) Their analysis highlights deficiencies in the models' ability to comprehend eliminative rationales. It also shows that the human-written rationales collected are more detailed and supportive compared to model-generated ones.

In summary, the paper introduces a new benchmark to evaluate logical reasoning, demonstrates current model limitations, and provides analysis revealing gaps in understanding eliminative rationales. The overall contribution is advancing the assessment of critical reasoning skills in language models.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my review of the paper's content, some of the key terms and keywords associated with this paper include:

- Logical reading comprehension
- Critical reasoning
- Rationale understanding
- Multiple-choice QA
- Language models (LMs)
- Large language models (LLMs)
- Auxiliary questions/subquestions
- Selective/eliminative rationales
- Crowdsourcing

The paper presents a new dataset called RULE (rationale understanding for logical reasoning evaluation) consisting of main logical reading comprehension questions taken from an existing dataset, along with new auxiliary multiple-choice subquestions. The subquestions are designed to test understanding of the rationale behind selecting the correct answer and eliminating incorrect answers for the main questions. Experiments using recent LLMs show deficiencies in consistently answering main questions and aligned subquestions, especially for subquestions about eliminating answer options. Analysis provides further evidence that models lack comprehensive critical reasoning abilities. Key methods include crowdsourcing rationales, generating subquestions with an LLM, and model evaluation in various settings.


## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in the paper:

1. What was the motivation behind creating a new dataset to evaluate critical reasoning capability in language models? Why were existing datasets like ReClor insufficient?

2. Why did the authors choose to collect free-form rationales from crowdworkers instead of using model-generated rationales? What are the potential benefits and downsides of this approach?

3. The paper mentions ensuring the "human answerability" of generated subquestions. What steps were taken to validate this, and why is it an important criterion? 

4. When constructing the subquestions, incomplete rationale sets were completed using a "None of the above" option. What implications could this choice have on model evaluation?

5. The consistency metric tracks how often models get both the main question and all subquestions correct. Why is this a more comprehensive measure of critical reasoning than just subquestion accuracy?

6. Models struggled more on eliminative subquestions compared to selective ones. What explanations are provided for this discrepancy in the analysis section? Can you think of any other potential reasons?

7. What are some limitations of using a multiple choice format for the questions? How could the evaluation be expanded to other formats to provide additional insights? 

8. The paper covers both finetuning models on ReClor vs few-shot and zero-shot evaluation. What are the tradeoffs between these settings in assessing reasoning skills?

9. Chain-of-thought prompting aims to explain reasoning but was not very effective here. Why might complex critical reasoning be challenging for this technique?

10. The paper analyzes different types of reasoning required for the rationale task. Can you categorize some examples into direct/indirect and contextual/external types? Why might models struggle with certain categories?
