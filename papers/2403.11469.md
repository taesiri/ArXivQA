 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Generative Motion Stylization within Canonical Motion Space":

Problem: 
Existing methods for stylized motion synthesis face two key challenges - inability to effectively express motion style on characters with different skeleton structures, and lack of support for flexible style control using diverse modalities like text, images, videos etc. Most methods assume fixed skeleton topology between source and target characters, limiting cross-character stylization. They also rely only on sample motions or labels to represent style, restricting flexibility. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes MotionS, a generative stylization pipeline to synthesize diverse, stylized motions for various characters using cross-modality style prompts like text, images, videos. Two key ideas:

1) Cross-modality style embedding: Leverage CLIP to align motion features of SMPL model with CLIP image and text latents. Construct shared space representing motion style as adaptive statistics over motion features. Enables flexible style descriptions.

2) Cross-structure topology shifting: Learn topology-encoded tokens to capture canonical (SMPL) and character-specific topologies. Use cross-attention to shift motion topology between spaces. Allows stylization across topologies.

These techniques construct a canonical motion space to enable motion stylization using extracted style features. The topology-shifted stylization diffusion model generates diverse motions, shifts them to canonical space for stylization using style embedding, then shifts back.

Main Contributions:

- First generative pipeline for cross-character and cross-modality motion stylization 

- Novel cross-modality style embedding strategy to align SMPL motion space with CLIP

- Novel topology shifting technique to transfer motions across different skeleton topologies

- State-of-the-art qualitative and quantitative performance compared to strong baselines

The method demonstrates robust stylized motion generation for diverse characters using flexible text, image, video prompts. It advances research in controllable procedural animation.
