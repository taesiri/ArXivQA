# [Model Comparison for Fast Domain Adaptation in Table Service Scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05092)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Automating customer service tasks like taking orders and processing payments in restaurants has progressed, but providing appropriate service during meals remains challenging due to variety in cuisine, service needs, and standards across restaurants. 

Proposed Solution:
- Develop an approach to automatically check table conditions and provide necessary services during meals. 
- Construct a base model to recognize common information to understand table context, like object categories, remaining food quantities, and meal progress.
- Add a service recognition classifier and retrain the model using small amounts of restaurant-specific data to adapt it.

Data:  
- Base model trained on 3 datasets with object labels, food amounts, meal progress labels.  
- Restaurant-specific model trained on 2 videos from cafeteria with service labels (refill, trash, dessert, lost item).

Model Details:  
- Used Deformable DETR architecture with added outputs for food amounts and meal progress.
- Frozen backbone and tested combinations of image features and table info for service classifier.

Key Findings:
- Combining low-level image features and high-level recognized table info works best.  
- With small retraining datasets, choosing a few important diverse samples gives better results than full datasets.  
- Simpler models suit sparse restaurant-specific data.

Main Contributions:
- Demonstrated approach to adapt table service recognition to new restaurants with small data.
- Analysis of different input combinations and datasets for low-resource domain adaptation.
- Findings help guide applying models to new restaurants efficiently.

The paper provides useful insights for adapting vision models to new domains efficiently with limited in-domain data, an important direction to enable wider use of AI systems.
