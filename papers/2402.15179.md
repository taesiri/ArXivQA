# [Advancing Parameter Efficiency in Fine-tuning via Representation Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15179)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on downstream tasks is very expensive computationally as it requires updating all the model parameters. 
- Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Adapters and LoRA still require a considerable number of trainable parameters.
- Other PEFT methods have challenges in hyperparameter selection (e.g. rank selection).

Proposed Solution: 
- The paper proposes a new method called Representation Editing (RED) that directly modifies the neural representations in each transformer layer using two small trainable "edit" vectors - a scaling vector and a bias vector.
- This allows fine-tuning the model without updating any of the base model parameters, making it extremely parameter-efficient.

Key Contributions:
- RED reduces trainable parameters substantially - by a factor of 25,700x fewer parameters than full fine-tuning and 32x fewer than LoRA.
- Experiments conducted on models like RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5 and Llama-2 on various NLU and NLG datasets show RED matches or exceeds performance of other PEFT approaches.
- Ablation studies demonstrate both the scaling and bias vectors in RED contribute to performance gains.
- RED shows strong performance even with very limited trainable parameters, indicating potential for further reduction.
- Overall, RED provides an effective and simplified approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning through direct editing of representations.

In summary, the paper proposes RED, a novel and performant technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that works by directly modifying the neural representations of transformer layers using small trainable edit vectors. Extensive experiments validate RED's effectiveness across models and tasks.
