# [Preparing Lessons for Progressive Training on Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09192)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Training large transformer models is computationally expensive and has high environmental costs. 
- Using small pretrained models helps efficiency but may not work for new model architectures.  
- Training from scratch can be slow, and prior progressive layer stacking methods have limited acceleration.

Proposed Solution:
- Introduce Apollo, a novel progressive training method that prepares "lessons" for low layers to learn high layer functionality.  
- Uses weight sharing across layers sampled by a Low-Value-Prioritized Sampling (LVPS) technique.
- Replaces direct layer stacking with a more stable layer interpolation method.
- Overall enables efficient expanding model depth during training.

Main Contributions:
- Apollo achieves state-of-the-art acceleration even compared to methods relying on pretrained models. 41.6% FLOPs reduction for BERT.
- LVPS sampling balances computation efficiency and performance.
- Analysis shows interpolation more stable than stacking for expanding depth.
- Experiments validate Apollo works well for BERT and GPT, showing its universality.
- Reduces computational resource usage and carbon footprint for training transformers.

In summary, Apollo is a novel progressive training technique using strategic weight sharing and interpolation to teach low layers high layer functionality. This allows efficient expanding model depth during training, achieving significant accelerations in FLOPs and wall time compared to prior approaches. The method is universal for different model architectures.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 Here is a one-sentence summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a novel method called Apollo that accelerates transformer training from scratch by preparing lessons for lower-layer weights to learn high-layer functionality in advance through dynamic weight sharing and expanding model depth via layer interpolation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contribution is proposing a novel method called Apollo for efficiently training deep language models. Specifically:

1) Apollo prepares "lessons" for low-layer weights to learn high-layer functionality during training, enabling effective expansion of the model depth later. This results in significant acceleration of training. 

2) Apollo uses a strategic weight sharing approach along with a novel sampling technique called Low-Value-Prioritized Sampling (LVPS) to enable low layers to capture information about high layers while minimizing computational costs.

3) Apollo replaces direct layer stacking with layer interpolation to expand model depth, enhancing stability compared to prior progressive training methods. 

4) Experiments show Apollo achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across BERT and GPT models, even surpassing methods relying on pretrained models, demonstrating it as an efficient and universal solution for training deep language models.

In summary, the key innovation is the Apollo method itself, which through prepared lessons and strategic expansion of depth, can efficiently train deep models from scratch while reducing time, computational, and environmental costs.


## What are the keywords or key terms associated with this paper?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some of the key terms and concepts are:

- Transformers - The paper focuses on efficiently training Transformer models.

- Progressive training - The idea of progressively increasing the size of a model during training to improve efficiency. 

- Apollo - The proposed method in the paper for preparing lessons to teach low layers high-layer functionality to facilitate efficient progressive training.

- Low-value-prioritized sampling (LVPS) - A sampling technique used in Apollo to predominantly sample shallower layers to reduce computation while still learning high-layer information. 

- Weight sharing - Apollo uses weight sharing to distribute lower layer weights to higher layers sampled by LVPS to teach functionality.

- Layer interpolation - A more stable expansion technique compared to layer stacking when increasing model depth in Apollo.

- Acceleration ratio - The main evaluation metric quantifying training efficiency improvements from the proposed Apollo method.

- FLOPs - Floating point operations, a measure of computation complexity that is used to evaluate model training efficiency.

So in summary, the key terms cover the proposed Apollo training approach, its components like LVPS and weight sharing, efficiency metrics, and comparison to other progressive training techniques.
