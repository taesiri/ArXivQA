# [A Robotic Skill Learning System Built Upon Diffusion Policies and   Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16730)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Robots lack the necessary skills to accomplish various user-specified tasks in real-world environments due to the long-tailed nature of skills needed. 
- Existing methods for teaching robots new skills have limitations in terms of number of demonstrations needed, robustness, and ability to sequence skills.

Proposed Solution - Robotic Skill Learning System (RSLS):

- Uses diffusion policies to enable a robot to acquire new manipulation skills from around 100 teleoperated demonstrations from the user. Diffusion policies provide sample efficiency and robustness.

- Incorporates large pre-trained language (LLM) and visual language (VLM) models to select appropriate skills from a library given user instructions and current scene observations. Handles requesting new skills to be taught when no existing skill matches.

- LLM matches user prompt to skill descriptions. VLM checks preconditions in visual scene to determine if selected skill can execute.

- VR interface for intuitive skill demonstrations. Tool changer equips robot with needed tools.  

Contributions:

- Fully-functional system for continuously expanding robot skill library via human teaching 

- Compared LLMs/VLMs for skill selection capability  

- Applied diffusion policies to contact-rich manipulation (e.g. bottle opening)

- Detailed experimental analysis of:
   - Individual skill performance
   - LLM and VLM as skill selectors  
   - Full system validation

- Public datasets of demonstrations and model evaluation

The system and experiments showcase acquiring and sequencing multiple real-world skills on a robot manipulator, enabled through the combination of diffusion visuomotor policies and foundation models.
