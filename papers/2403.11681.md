## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Surface prediction and completion is an important topic with applications like 3D reconstruction and autonomous driving. Research has evolved from small objects to large-scale scenes. 
- Existing datasets lack diversity in modalities and real-world data. They also lack the ability to efficiently scale up in size. An efficient way to create multi-modal scene-level datasets is needed.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes MASSTAR, a Multi-modal Large-scale Scene dataset with a Versatile Toolchain for surface prediction and completion. 
- A versatile toolchain is developed to:
  - Segment high-quality models from raw 3D data
  - Render multi-modal data like images, text descriptions, partial point clouds
- The toolchain is used to create an example dataset with over 1000 scene-level models and some real-world data.

Main Contributions:
- A versatile and efficient toolchain to generate multi-modal data from raw 3D environments
- A large-scale multi-modal scene dataset for surface prediction/completion 
- Benchmark of surface completion methods revealing limitations of existing techniques
- The toolchain and dataset will be publicly released to promote research

In summary, the paper presents MASSTAR, an efficiently generated multi-modal scene-level dataset to promote surface completion research, along with a versatile data generation toolchain. Key limitations of current methods are revealed through benchmarking experiments.
