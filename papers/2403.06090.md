# [Diffusion Models Trained with Large Data Are Transferable Visual Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06090)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Computer vision (CV) lags behind natural language processing (NLP) partly due to the lack of large-scale pretraining datasets. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have been trained on massive image-text pairs (LAION-5B dataset with 5 billion pairs). 

- However, directly transferring such generative diffusion models to discriminative vision tasks like segmentation is challenging due to the mismatch between stochastic image generation and deterministic perception requirements.

Method: 
- The paper proposes GenPercept to simply initialize CV models with pretrained UNet/transformer from diffusion models and finetune on target tasks with minimal modifications.

- It reformulates the diffusion process as an interpolation between RGB image latents and ground truth latents. This helps mitigate randomness and focuses more on target signal.

- Further, it simplifies the multi-step diffusion to a one-step process for efficiency and performance. Custom losses and decoders are also incorporated.

Contributions:
- Shows strong transfer performance of diffusion backbones with good generalization, even when finetuned on limited (even synthetic-only) target data.

- Evaluated on diverse fundamental CV tasks - depth estimation, surface normal estimation, segmentation, matting, pose estimation. Consistently achieves promising results.

- Simple framework that is highly efficient without needing multiple stochastic forward passes or encoder-decoder architectures. Embarrassingly easy to implement.

- Analyses reveal strong generalization of diffusion backbones, with performance scaling significantly with amount of finetuning data while being viable even with only a few hundred examples.

In summary, the paper provides empirical evidence for using readily available generative model priors to effectively bootstrap vision perception models. The proposed GenPercept paradigm is simple, efficient and delivers excellent performance across tasks.
