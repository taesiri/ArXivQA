# [FreeDoM: Training-Free Energy-Guided Conditional Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09833)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question it addresses is:How can we develop a training-free conditional diffusion model that supports diverse conditions and is compatible with different types of diffusion models?The key points of the paper's approach seem to be:- Using energy functions to guide the sampling process in a flexible way, as energy functions can be constructed for various conditions.- Approximating the time-dependent energy functions with time-independent distance measuring functions based on off-the-shelf pretrained models. This makes the method training-free.- Proposing an efficient time-travel strategy to make the method work well even for large data domains like ImageNet. - Showing the approach is effective for various conditions like text, segmentation maps, sketches, landmarks, face IDs, style images, etc.- Demonstrating it works with different diffusion models, including image diffusion and latent diffusion models.So in summary, the main research contribution is developing a training-free framework that can flexibly incorporate diverse conditions to guide various diffusion models, which improves the applicability and reduces the cost of conditional diffusion models.
