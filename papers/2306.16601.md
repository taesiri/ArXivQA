# [An Efficient Sparse Inference Software Accelerator for Transformer-based   Language Models on CPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16601)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research question/hypothesis appears to be:How to develop an efficient sparse deep learning inference software stack for Transformer-based language models, where the weights are pruned with a constant block size sparsity pattern, in order to improve inference efficiency on CPUs.The key ideas and components involved seem to be:- Using a structured sparsity pattern with constant block size 4x1.- Developing optimized sparse GEMM and sparse attention kernels leveraging Intel Deep Learning Boost to maximize performance on CPUs. - Comparing against existing sparse GEMM libraries like oneMKL, TVM, LIBXSMM and showing significant speedups.- Applying the techniques on popular Transformer models like BERT and showing improved throughput under latency constraints compared to frameworks like ONNX Runtime and PyTorch.- Comparing against other sparse inference engines like Neural Magic DeepSparse and demonstrating speedups.So in summary, the main hypothesis appears to be that using structured sparsity along with optimized sparse kernels can enable efficient sparse inference of Transformer models on CPUs. The paper seems aimed at validating this hypothesis through benchmarks and comparisons to other techniques/libraries/frameworks.


## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main research focus is developing an efficient sparse deep learning inference software stack for Transformer-based language models on CPUs. Specifically, the authors aim to accelerate inference for sparse Transformer models by leveraging structured sparsity and quantization techniques. The key hypothesis appears to be that by using a structured sparsity pattern (4x1) along with quantization, and implementing optimized sparse matrix kernels and end-to-end optimizations, they can achieve significant speedups for sparse Transformer model inference on CPUs compared to existing solutions.The paper seems centered around showing empirically that their proposed sparse software accelerator enables efficient sparse inference for Transformer models, outperforming current sparse libraries, frameworks, and other inference engines in terms of throughput under latency constraints.
