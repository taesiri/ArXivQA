# [Common Diffusion Noise Schedules and Sample Steps are Flawed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08891)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question is: How can we ensure consistency between the training and inference behavior of diffusion models, so they can generate samples across the full range of brightness levels?The key hypotheses appear to be:1) Common diffusion noise schedules and sampling implementations have flaws that cause a discrepancy between training and inference. Specifically:- Noise schedules do not enforce zero signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the last timestep. This causes signal leakage during training.- Samplers do not always start from the last timestep. This exposes models to nonzero SNR inputs at inference. 2) Aligning the training and inference by enforcing zero terminal SNR, using v prediction, sampling from the last timestep, and rescaling classifier-free guidance will allow models to generate the full range of brightness.So in summary, the central research question is how to make diffusion training and inference congruent so models can generate samples with diverse brightness levels. The hypotheses are that common schedules and samplers have flaws, and fixing them will solve the problem.
