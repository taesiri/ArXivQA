# [Post-training Quantization on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15736)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

Based on my reading of the paper abstract, it seems the central research question is:How to accelerate denoising diffusion models through post-training quantization in a training-free manner?The key points are:- Denoising diffusion (score-based) models are slow due to lengthy iterative noise estimation using cumbersome neural networks. - Previous acceleration methods focus on finding shorter sampling trajectories, but overlook the computational cost of noise estimation networks.- This paper proposes using post-training quantization (PTQ) to compress and accelerate the noise estimation networks in a training-free manner.- Implementing PTQ on diffusion models is challenging due to the discrepancy in output distributions across time steps. - The paper explores various aspects of PTQ for diffusion models and proposes a tailored solution involving sampling time steps from a skew normal distribution.- Experiments show the proposed method can quantize diffusion models to 8-bits without performance loss, achieving up to 2x speedup.In summary, the key hypothesis is that post-training quantization can be an effective way to accelerate diffusion models in a training-free manner, if designed properly to account for the unique structure of these models.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

Based on my reading of the paper, the main contributions appear to be:1. Introducing post-training quantization (PTQ) to accelerate denoising diffusion models, which can quantize pre-trained models to 8-bit without retraining. This allows faster sampling while maintaining performance. 2. Analyzing challenges in applying PTQ to diffusion models due to their multi-timestep structure and changing distributions. Previous PTQ methods are designed for single timestep scenarios.3. Proposing a diffusion model specific calibration method called Normally Distributed Timestep Calibration (NDTC) that samples timesteps from a skew normal distribution to better cover the distribution shifts.4. Showing through experiments that their proposed PTQ method can quantize diffusion models to 8-bit without significant performance degradation. In some cases it even slightly improves metrics like IS and FID.5. Demonstrating their method can be combined with other sampling acceleration methods like DDIM as a plug-and-play module, providing orthogonal benefits.In summary, the key contribution is introducing training-free quantization via PTQ to compress and accelerate sampling in diffusion models, using a tailored calibration method to handle the model's unique properties. This provides a new direction for accelerating and deploying diffusion models.


## What is the TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) version of the paper? If you had to summarize it in one sentence, what would that be?

Here is a one sentence TL;DR summary of the paper:The paper introduces post-training quantization to accelerate diffusion models for image generation by proposing a new calibration method that accounts for the changing distributions of the model outputs over time steps.
