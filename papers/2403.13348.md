## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Multi-robot 3D reconstruction faces challenges in inter-robot pose estimation, localization uncertainty quantification, and active best-next-view selection. 
- Traditional methods rely on appearance-based loop closure for aligning maps across robots, but this has complications. 
- Need methods for relative pose estimation, quantifying uncertainty, and intelligent view planning to improve reconstruction.

Proposed Solution - MULAN-WC:
- Leverages wireless signals (AOA, ranging) between robots for inter-robot pose estimation instead of just visual features.
- Develops method to quantify AOA uncertainty and incorporate into NeRF training loss to mitigate inaccurate poses. 
- Proposes active view selection approach that samples novel views and evaluates expected rendering variance reduction, considering pose uncertainties.
- Directs robots to capture views that maximize info gain for NeRF.

Main Contributions:
- Framework integrating wireless coordination into multi-robot localization uncertainty-aware NeRF
- Method for collaborative active image acquisition based on variance reduction 
- Extensive experiments on synthetic and real robot hardware demonstrating:
  - Achieves high quality 3D reconstruction close to ground truth poses
  - Uncertainty-aware training improves accuracy
  - Active view finding leads to consistent rendering quality improvement

In summary, the paper presents a full pipeline leveraging wireless signals, uncertainty quantification, and active view planning to enable accurate and efficient multi-robot 3D reconstruction with NeRF. Key innovations are around inter-robot coordination, uncertainty-based training supervision, and intelligent next best view direction to optimize scene coverage.

The paper presents a multi-robot 3D reconstruction framework using wireless signal-based coordination for relative pose estimation between robots, uncertainty quantification to mitigate inaccurate poses, and active next-best-view finding for efficient scene coverage and model improvement.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. A framework for integrating SAR-based wireless coordination for Multi-Robot NeRF. This allows using wireless signals between robots to estimate relative poses and align views from different robots into a common frame of reference for NeRF-based 3D reconstruction.

2. Collaborative Active Image Acquisition. The paper introduces a framework for actively selecting the best next views for robots to capture, in order to maximize information gain and improve reconstruction quality with NeRF. This utilizes uncertainty quantification and novel-view location sampling.  

3. Extensive Experiments on hardware robots. The methods are evaluated not just in simulation but also deployed to customized hardware robots with onboard sensors and computation. This demonstrates the practical applicability of the approach.

So in summary, the key innovations are in enabling multi-robot NeRF with wireless coordination, actively acquiring informative views based on uncertainty, and showing experimental validation on real robotic systems. The integration of wireless signals, active acquisition, and multi-robot collaboration are the main contributions for improving NeRF-based 3D reconstruction.
