# [Error Feedback Reloaded: From Quadratic to Arithmetic Mean of Smoothness   Constants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10774)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Distributed machine learning methods like distributed gradient descent often use communication compression techniques to alleviate the communication bottleneck. However, powerful compressors like TopK and RankK are biased and the theoretical understanding of algorithms using them is weak compared to unbiased compressors. In particular, the best known rate for the EF21 algorithm matches vanilla gradient descent without compression. There is a need to improve the theory for methods like EF21 that work with general contractive compressors.

Proposed Solution and Contributions:

1. The paper proposes to clone problematic machines with higher smoothness constants $L_i$, which allows replacing the quadratic mean (QM) of the $L_i$'s with their arithmetic mean (AM) in the EF21 rate. However, this requires more devices. 

2. A weighted EF21 algorithm (EF21-W) is proposed where server aggregates client gradients using weights $w_i = L_i/(\sum_j L_j)$. This allows improving the convergence rate dependence from QM to AM of smoothness constants, without cloning devices.

3. Further analysis shows that the weights can be pushed from the EF21-W algorithm into the analysis. This allows showing that even the original EF21 algorithm has an improved dependence on the AM instead of the QM.

4. The improvements apply to many EF21 variants including stochastic gradients and partial participation. The method also improves the known EF21 theory in the rare features regime.

5. Experiments on logistic regression with synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that EF21-W offers faster convergence compared to vanilla EF21 when there is high variance in client smoothness constants. The gains can be significant in practice.

In summary, the paper provides the first known improvement in the convergence rate of EF21 methods compared to baseline gradient descent, when used with general contractive compressors. This is done via a weighted analysis technique without any change to the algorithm. Practical gains are shown on nonconvex optimization tasks.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes improved convergence rates for the Error Feedback (EF21) distributed optimization algorithm by replacing the dependence on the quadratic mean of smoothness constants with the arithmetic mean.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 The main contribution of this paper is an improved convergence rate guarantee for the EF21 error feedback method for distributed optimization. Specifically, the authors show that by using a weighted analysis approach, the dependence on the quadratic mean of smoothness constants (LQM) in the convergence rate of EF21 can be improved to a dependence on the arithmetic mean (LAM). Since LAM is always smaller than LQM, this leads to a better convergence guarantee. The improvement is shown to hold for the original EF21 method as well as variants like EF21-W, EF21-SGD, and EF21-PP. Experiments validate that the new analysis translates to faster convergence empirically as well. Overall, this work provides an important step towards better theoretical guarantees for error feedback methods.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 potential in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes an improved convergence rate for EF21 by replacing the quadratic mean (LQM) of smoothness constants with the arithmetic mean (LAM). Can you explain intuitively why using LAM instead of LQM leads to a better convergence guarantee? What is the role of the smoothness constant variance in this improvement?

2. The paper takes the reader through the journey of discovering the improved rate via client cloning, update weighting, and finally a new analysis. Can you summarize the key insights gained at each step that ultimately led to the final theorem? 

3. The client cloning approach requires additional computing resources. How does the update weighting scheme aim to gain the benefits of cloning without actually cloning clients? Explain the intuition behind this transition.

4. Update weighting modifies the algorithm, while the final improved rate comes from a new analysis. Can you explain why the weighted analysis also applies to original EF21 without changing the algorithm?

5. How does the improvement depend on the compressor contraction parameter α? For which ranges of α can we expect substantial gains? When does the new rate match the original rate?

6. The paper claims the analysis extends to stochastic gradient and partial participation variants of EF21. Can you sketch how the analysis would differ for these cases? What changes would be needed?

7. The experiments focus on non-convex problems. Why is handling non-convexity important in practice? What challenges does it introduce compared to convex settings?  

8. The rare features setting is also discussed. How is this problem formulation different? Why does the arithmetic mean appear here too?

9. What modifications were made to the definition of the sparsity constant c compared to the original EF21 rare features paper? Why was this adjustment necessary?

10. The natural compressor experiments highlight that gains can occur beyond proving theorems. When can large practical gains outstrip theory? How can we characterize such regimes?
