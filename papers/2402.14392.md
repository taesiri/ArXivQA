# [Reading Relevant Feature from Global Representation Memory for Visual   Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14392)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper:

Problem:
Existing visual object trackers either use a fixed template or all historical frames in memory to match against the search region. However, due to changes in target appearance and background over time, the required historical information is different across search regions and timesteps. Using all template/memory features leads to redundancy and may impair tracking performance. 

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes a tracking framework (RFGM) with two main components to address this problem:

1) Global Representation (GR) Memory: This memory stores the most representative target features across the whole video sequence at the token level. Unlike prior trackers that update memory with entire templates, RFGM uses a relevance attention mechanism (described next) to select the most relevant tokens from both the existing memory and new template to update the memory. This reduces redundancy and accumulation of errors.

2) Relevance Attention: This attention mechanism dynamically chooses the most relevant historical tokens from the GR memory to match against the current search region. It globally reads across frames to find the optimal tokens instead of using a fixed template. This allows adapting to appearance changes over time.

Main Contributions:

1) A new tracking paradigm consisting of a GR memory and relevance attention to reduce redundancy by reading only the most useful historical information.

2) The GR memory specifically stores the most representative target features across all frames using the relevance attention for updates. This handles target appearance variation over long sequences.

3) The relevance attention mechanism that can globally access historical tokens across frames and select the ones most relevant for the current search region.

4) Achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance on five benchmarks including TrackingNet, GOT-10k, LaSOT, OTB, and UAV123. The ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GR memory and relevance attention components.

In summary, the core idea is to construct a robust global representation memory across frames, and access only the most relevant historical information from this memory specific to each search region. This improves adaptation to appearance changes and reduces redundancy.
