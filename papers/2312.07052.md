# [Adjustable Robust Transformer for High Myopia Screening in Optical   Coherence Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07052)

## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Adjustable Robust Transformer (ARTran) for automatically screening high myopia from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. ARTran introduces three key components: 1) Anisotropic patch embedding to better capture directional structural changes in highly myopic retinas; 2) Adjustable class embedding to allow the screening criteria to be interactively adjusted to different severity thresholds; and 3) Shifted subspace transition matrix to enhance model robustness against label noise. Experiments demonstrate ARTran's superior performance over baselines, as well as its ability to provide compliant screening outcomes for variable inclusion criteria. Additional analyses also show ARTran can evaluate screening uncertainty to improve reliability. In summary, ARTran is an accurate, adjustable, and interpretable AI system for automated high myopia screening from OCT scans. Its proposed techniques help address key challenges in this screening task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening of optical coherence tomography images, which adapts to variable inclusion criteria, captures discriminative features, enhances robustness to label noise, and provides uncertainty evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening to adapt variable inclusion criteria. This includes designing an anisotropic patch embedding (APE) to capture more discriminative features and an adjustable class embedding (ACE) to obtain adjustable inferences.

2. Proposing a shifted subspace transition matrix (SST) to mitigate the negative impacts of label noise and enhance robustness. 

3. Implementing ARTran on a high myopia dataset and verifying its effectiveness for screening. The model can jointly generate multi-perspective uncertainty evaluation results using the proposed ACE and SST modules.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing the ARTran model for adjustable and robust high myopia screening, along with uncertainty evaluation capabilities. The key novel components are the APE, ACE, and SST modules.

The paper proposes an adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) model for screening high myopia using OCT images. Key aspects include designing modules like APE and ACE to capture discriminative features and make the model adjustable to different screening criteria. It also uses strategies like the proposed SST matrix to handle label noise in the data. The method is evaluated on an OCT dataset and shown to outperform other baseline methods.
