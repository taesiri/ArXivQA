## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Adjustable Robust Transformer (ARTran) for automatically screening high myopia from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. ARTran introduces three key components: 1) Anisotropic patch embedding to better capture directional structural changes in highly myopic retinas; 2) Adjustable class embedding to allow the screening criteria to be interactively adjusted to different severity thresholds; and 3) Shifted subspace transition matrix to enhance model robustness against label noise. Experiments demonstrate ARTran's superior performance over baselines, as well as its ability to provide compliant screening outcomes for variable inclusion criteria. Additional analyses also show ARTran can evaluate screening uncertainty to improve reliability. In summary, ARTran is an accurate, adjustable, and interpretable AI system for automated high myopia screening from OCT scans. Its proposed techniques help address key challenges in this screening task.
