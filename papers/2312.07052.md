## Write a very high-quality paragraph summarizing the paper that effectively covers the paper.

 Here is a high-quality paragraph summarizing the key points of the paper:

This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework called Adjustable Robust Transformer (ARTran) for automatically screening high myopia from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. ARTran introduces three key components: 1) Anisotropic patch embedding to better capture directional structural changes in highly myopic retinas; 2) Adjustable class embedding to allow the screening criteria to be interactively adjusted to different severity thresholds; and 3) Shifted subspace transition matrix to enhance model robustness against label noise. Experiments demonstrate ARTran's superior performance over baselines, as well as its ability to provide compliant screening outcomes for variable inclusion criteria. Additional analyses also show ARTran can evaluate screening uncertainty to improve reliability. In summary, ARTran is an accurate, adjustable, and interpretable AI system for automated high myopia screening from OCT scans. Its proposed techniques help address key challenges in this screening task.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes an adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening of optical coherence tomography images, which adapts to variable inclusion criteria, captures discriminative features, enhances robustness to label noise, and provides uncertainty evaluation.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions are:

1. Proposing a novel adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening to adapt variable inclusion criteria. This includes designing an anisotropic patch embedding (APE) to capture more discriminative features and an adjustable class embedding (ACE) to obtain adjustable inferences.

2. Proposing a shifted subspace transition matrix (SST) to mitigate the negative impacts of label noise and enhance robustness. 

3. Implementing ARTran on a high myopia dataset and verifying its effectiveness for screening. The model can jointly generate multi-perspective uncertainty evaluation results using the proposed ACE and SST modules.

So in summary, the main contributions are proposing the ARTran model for adjustable and robust high myopia screening, along with uncertainty evaluation capabilities. The key novel components are the APE, ACE, and SST modules.

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Myopia is a common vision condition causing blurred distance vision. High myopia in particular can progress to irreversible vision damage. Screening high myopia using retinal imaging like optical coherence tomography (OCT) is important for early intervention.
- However, criteria for defining high myopia vary across studies, posing challenges for developing automated screening systems. There is also natural label noise between structural changes in OCT and spherical equivalent (SE) measures used to identify high myopia. 
- Existing screening methods do not address these issues to provide adjustable and robust screening.

Proposed Solution:
- The paper proposes an Adjustable Robust Transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening in OCT.

Key Contributions:

1. Anisotropic Patch Embedding (APE) to capture more directional features related to myopia from OCT.

2. Adjustable Class Embedding (ACE) to make the model adaptively output screening decisions based on different severity thresholds for high myopia.

3. Shifted Subspace Transition Matrix (SST) to enhance robustness against label noise by mapping noisy predictions to the correct output space.

4. Uncertainty evaluation by using disagreement across ACE predictions, posterior probability and variance to identify challenging cases.

5. Experiments show ARTran outperforms state-of-the-art methods for high myopia screening. The modules also demonstrate effectiveness through ablation studies. The model provides adjustable and reliable screening while evaluating uncertainty.

In summary, the key innovation is an end-to-end adjustable and robust transformer for screening high myopia in OCT images, with the ability to adapt criteria and identify uncertainty. The model and analyses aim to increase real-world utility.
