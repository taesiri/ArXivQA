## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Customize-A-Video: One-Shot Motion Customization of Text-to-Video Diffusion Models":

Problem:
Existing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models can generate imaginative videos from text prompts, but struggle with precise motion control and require extensive prompt engineering. Video editing methods can transfer motions from reference videos but simply duplicate frames without temporal diversity. The paper explores the task of one-shot motion customization - learning a motion from a single reference video and adapting it to new subjects and scenes with variability.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes "Customize-A-Video", which uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the temporal attention layers of a pre-trained T2V diffusion model to capture the motion signature. To facilitate one-shot learning, it introduces a novel "Appearance Absorber" module to decompose spatial features from motion. This is trained first on unordered frames to absorb appearance. The temporal LoRA is then trained on full frames to focus on motion.

Key Contributions:
1) A Temporal LoRA method to customize T2V models for one-shot motion transfer with accuracy and variety.
2) An Appearance Absorber technique to exclude spatial information from motion modeling through a staged training process.  
3) Downstream applications enabled by the plug-and-play nature, including video appearance customization and multi-motion combination.

The method shows superior motion transfer over baselines while introducing variability unseen in per-frame duplication approaches. It supports customizing pre-trained models for precise video editing without losing diversity. The modules facilitate appearance-motion decomposition and have flexibility for extension.
