# [Customize-A-Video: One-Shot Motion Customization of Text-to-Video   Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14780)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the paper "Customize-A-Video: One-Shot Motion Customization of Text-to-Video Diffusion Models":

Problem:
Existing text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models can generate imaginative videos from text prompts, but struggle with precise motion control and require extensive prompt engineering. Video editing methods can transfer motions from reference videos but simply duplicate frames without temporal diversity. The paper explores the task of one-shot motion customization - learning a motion from a single reference video and adapting it to new subjects and scenes with variability.  

Proposed Solution:
The paper proposes "Customize-A-Video", which uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the temporal attention layers of a pre-trained T2V diffusion model to capture the motion signature. To facilitate one-shot learning, it introduces a novel "Appearance Absorber" module to decompose spatial features from motion. This is trained first on unordered frames to absorb appearance. The temporal LoRA is then trained on full frames to focus on motion.

Key Contributions:
1) A Temporal LoRA method to customize T2V models for one-shot motion transfer with accuracy and variety.
2) An Appearance Absorber technique to exclude spatial information from motion modeling through a staged training process.  
3) Downstream applications enabled by the plug-and-play nature, including video appearance customization and multi-motion combination.

The method shows superior motion transfer over baselines while introducing variability unseen in per-frame duplication approaches. It supports customizing pre-trained models for precise video editing without losing diversity. The modules facilitate appearance-motion decomposition and have flexibility for extension.


## Summarize the paper in one sentence.

 This paper proposes a novel method called Customize-A-Video for one-shot motion customization of text-to-video diffusion models using a Temporal LoRA module and Appearance Absorber module to capture motion from a single reference video and transfer it to new subjects and scenes with spatial and temporal diversity.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 According to the paper, the main contributions of this work involve:

1) Proposing a novel one-shot motion customization method for single reference video based on pre-trained text-to-video diffusion models.

2) Introducing a Temporal LoRA module to learn the specific motion from a reference video, facilitating motion transfer with not only accuracy but also variety.  

3) Proposing a new Appearance Absorber module to effectively decompose the spatial information, strategically excluding it from the motion customization process.

4) The modules feature the plug-and-play nature and can be smoothly extended to multiple downstream applications.

In summary, the key contribution is presenting an effective approach for one-shot video motion customization that can transfer the motion from a single reference video to new scenes and subjects, while generating motion variability beyond just replicating the exact reference frames. The proposed Temporal LoRA and Appearance Absorber modules, along with the training strategy, are critical to achieving this.

- Appearance absorbers - An innovative concept proposed to train modules that can "absorb" the spatial appearance information from the reference video frames, allowing T-LoRA to focus on modeling temporal motion patterns.

- Spatial LoRA (S-LoRA) - One type of appearance absorber based on applying LoRA to the spatial attention layers to capture appearance. 

- Textual inversion - An alternative appearance absorber method based on using placeholder tokens to learn appearance.

## Design 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper and avoid simple questions.

 Here are 10 in-depth questions about the method proposed in this paper:

1. The paper proposes a staged training pipeline with appearance absorbers and temporal LoRA. Can you explain the motivation and rationale behind this staged approach? How does it help with one-shot motion customization? 

2. The paper introduces the concept of appearance absorbers to disentangle spatial information from motions. Can you explain this concept in more detail? How do the different types of appearance absorbers (S-LoRA, textual inversion) work? What are their advantages and disadvantages?

3. The paper applies LoRA only on the temporal cross-frame attention layers (T-LoRA). Why is this more effective for capturing temporal motion dynamics compared to applying LoRA on other layers? What do the ablation studies show regarding this?

4. During inference, only the trained T-LoRA module is loaded without the appearance absorbers. Can you explain why this is an important part of the pipeline? How does it allow generating videos with novel appearances while retaining the learned motion?

5. The paper shows the method can be extended for multiple downstream applications like video appearance customization and multiple motion combination. Can you explain how the plug-and-play nature of LoRA modules enables these applications? 

6. What quantitative metrics are used to evaluate the method? Why is directly measuring motion similarity difficult? How do the metrics used reflect properties like accuracy, temporal consistency and diversity?

7. The paper compares against recent video editing methods that rely on DDIM inversion of reference frames. What are the limitations of these methods? And what advantages does the proposed approach offer?

8. What types of motions does the method handle well currently? What are some limitations regarding more subtle pose-based motions that rely heavily on spatial information?

9. The paper utilizes the ModelScope T2V diffusion model. How compatible and portable is the method to other emerging T2V architectures? Would it require any significant changes?

10. The appearance absorbers help exclude spatial signals from the training - but how sensitive is this to overfitting? Could spatial customization potentially hurt consistency with the base T2V model?
