# [Automatic Histograms: Leveraging Language Models for Text Dataset   Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14880)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem:
- Making sense of and understanding unstructured text datasets is increasingly important but difficult, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs). 
- Data workers need to develop a qualitative understanding of datasets before using them to train or evaluate LLMs. 
- Existing tools focus on annotating general attributes applicable across datasets, but analyses that provide interesting insights are often dataset-specific. 
- It's challenging to determine these dataset-specific attributes, annotate them at scale, and visualize their distributions.

Proposed Solution:
- The authors present AutoHistograms, a visualization tool that automatically identifies relevant features in a dataset and displays their distributions.
- It extracts frequent nouns/entities, clusters them using embeddings, labels clusters with an LLM, and counts examples containing each entity cluster.
- The interactive UI shows auto-generated histograms of these entity clusters, allows filtering examples by histogram buckets, and supports creating new histograms through semantic search queries.

Key Contributions:
- Preprocessing pipeline to automatically create dataset-specific histograms from raw text.
- Interactive visualization tool for analyzing and iteratively exploring histograms.
- User study with 10 data practitioners validating AutoHistograms enables quick insights into datasets and use cases like safety checks.
- Demonstrates how advancements in LLMs can facilitate developing effective data understanding tools.

In summary, this paper addresses the challenge of understanding text datasets by automatically generating and visualizing distributions of dataset-specific attributes using LLMs. A user study confirms the tool allows rapid qualitative insights, providing a promising direction for LLM-powered sensemaking.
