# [Beyond saliency: understanding convolutional neural networks from   saliency prediction on layer-wise relevance propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.08268)

## What is the central research question or hypothesis that this paper addresses?

 Based on my reading of the paper, the central research question seems to be: How can we better understand and visualize how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) comprehend images for classification tasks? 

Specifically, the authors propose a new two-step method to generate "Salient Relevance (SR) Maps" that aim to reveal the areas of input images, referred to as "attention areas", that deep CNN models focus on to recognize objects and make predictions. The two main steps are:

1) Using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to generate a pixel-wise relevance map for a given input image. 

2) Applying context-aware saliency detection on the LRP relevance map to filter out irrelevant regions and reveal the true attention areas. 

The overall goal is to develop a visualization technique that provides insights into how CNN models perceive and understand images, going beyond just predicting classification labels. The SR maps are intended to highlight the areas the models pay attention to and learn features from when recognizing objects.

So in summary, the central hypothesis is that by combining LRP and visual saliency, the proposed two-step method can effectively visualize the attention areas and internal comprehension of CNNs for image classification tasks. The experiments aim to demonstrate and validate this hypothesis.


## What is the main contribution of this paper?

 Based on my reading, the main contributions of this paper are:

1. Proposing a new two-step algorithm to generate a "Salient Relevance (SR) Map" to understand and interpret how deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recognize images. The SR map reveals the visual attention areas that contribute most to the network's classification. 

2. The proposed method combines layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) with context-aware saliency detection. LRP propagates the prediction probability backwards to get a pixel-wise relevance map. Context-aware saliency detection then filters this map to reveal the true attention areas.

3. Applying the proposed method to analyze and compare different CNN models (AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-Face) on the ImageNet dataset. The visualizations show which areas the models focus on for classification, revealing their strengths and weaknesses. 

4. Demonstrating that the proposed SR map effectively reveals the models' visual attention, simulating how humans tend to focus on salient areas rather than processing the whole image uniformly. The method provides interpretable visualization of how the models recognize images.

5. This is the first work, to the authors' knowledge, that incorporates attention and saliency for understanding and interpreting CNN models. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In summary, the main contribution is proposing an interpretable visualization technique to understand CNN image classification models by revealing their internal attention mechanisms using saliency-based relevance mapping.


## How does this paper compare to other research in the same field?

 This paper presents a novel method for understanding and visualizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using salient relevance maps. Here are some key ways it relates to other research in this field:

- It builds on the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method, which propagates a model's predictions backwards to determine the relevance of each input pixel. The paper enhances LRP by incorporating context-aware saliency detection to identify attention areas rather than just individual pixels. 

- Most prior visualization methods for CNNs focused on feature visualization via activation maximization or network inversion. These often produce abstract or hallucinated images that are hard to interpret. This paper takes a different approach of propagating from model predictions to highlight relevant regions in the original input image.

- Attention maps are a popular way to understand CNN focus, but are often derived from gradients or guided backpropagation. This paper uses saliency detection on the LRP relevance map instead to identify attention areas.

- The evaluation uses established CNN models like AlexNet and VGG on a standard dataset (ImageNet). Most prior work evaluated novel visualization methods on smaller custom models. The experiments here demonstrate the utility on real-world complex models.

- The comparisons to Deep SHAP and between different models on the same inputs provide insights into model differences. Most methods just visualize features of one model. 

Overall, this paper makes good advances in interpreting CNNs by enhancing LRP with saliency detection and demonstrating how the resulting salient relevance maps provide superior visualization and understanding of model predictions on real-world data and models compared to prior approaches. The method appears quite novel in identifying attention areas to explain model reasoning.


## What future research directions do the authors suggest?

 Based on my reading of the paper, some key future research directions suggested by the authors include:

- Applying their proposed method to analyze more complex neural network models like ResNet. The authors currently demonstrate their method on AlexNet and VGG models, but suggest examining deeper architectures like ResNet would be an interesting next step.

- Using the visual analysis to directly inform training adjustments and improvements to model performance. The authors suggest their visualization tool could be used not just to understand models, but also to identify weaknesses and make targeted changes to the training process. 

- Expanding the visualization to additional tasks beyond image classification, such as object detection, segmentation, etc. The current method focuses on unveiling how models classify images, but the authors suggest it could provide insight into other computer vision tasks as well.

- Providing more quantitative evaluation and comparisons to other methods beyond the SSIM metric used in the paper. The authors acknowledge their evaluations are mainly qualitative, and suggest more numerical benchmarks could lend additional support.

- Investigating how factors like network architecture, training data, etc. influence the resulting visualizations and attention maps produced by their method. The authors suggest systematically evaluating these factors could provide more understanding of deep learning interpretability.

In summary, the main future directions are applying the method to more complex models, using the visual analysis to directly improve model training, expanding to additional tasks beyond classification, more quantitative evaluation, and investigating how network factors influence the visualization results. The authors lay out several interesting avenues for building on their work to further demystify deep learning.


## Summarize the paper in one paragraph.

 Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:

The paper proposes a new two-step method to understand and visualize how deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recognize images. The method first uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to generate a pixel-wise relevance map indicating each pixel's contribution to the network's classification. It then refines this map into a salient relevance (SR) map using context-aware saliency detection to reveal the network's attention areas. Experiments on ImageNet show the SR map effectively identifies regions the network uses for classification, unlike LRP which highlights scattered pixels. Comparisons of AlexNet and VGG-16 reveal VGG-16's superior object separation abilities. The SR map also exposes cases where VGG-16 focuses on single objects without context, leading to errors. Overall, the SR map serves as an intuitive visual interface revealing which features the network learns during training.


## Summarize the paper in two paragraphs.

 Here is a two paragraph summary of the key points from the paper:

This paper proposes a new two-step method to visualize and understand convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generating a Salient Relevance (SR) map that reveals the visual attention areas the model focuses on to recognize objects in images. The first step uses layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to generate a pixel-wise relevance map highlighting important pixels in the input image for the model's classification. The second step filters this map through a context-aware saliency model to extract salient objects and attention areas rather than isolated pixels. Experiments on ImageNet validation images with AlexNet and VGG-16 show the SR maps effectively reveal the models' attention areas for recognizing objects. Comparisons to saliency maps of the original images show the models focus on different areas than humans. Case studies demonstrate using the SR maps to analyze differences between models like AlexNet and VGG-16 and reveal weaknesses in their understanding of full images.

In summary, this paper introduces a new visualization method combining LRP and saliency detection to generate Salient Relevance maps that reveal CNN models' attention areas and object recognition capabilities. The SR maps enable analyzing model differences and weaknesses by showing which parts of images they focus on for classification compared to human perception. The proposed approach provides an intuitive visual interface for opening up the black box of CNNs.
