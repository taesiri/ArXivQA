# [MambaMIL: Enhancing Long Sequence Modeling with Sequence Reordering in   Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06800)

## Write a very high-quality and detailed summary of the paper that describes the paper in a way that a human can fully understand. The summary should cover the problem, the proposed solution and highlight the main contributions of the paper.

 Here is a detailed summary of the key points from the paper:

Problem: 
- Existing multiple instance learning (MIL) methods for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology have limitations in modeling long-range dependencies among instances (tissue patches) and suffer from overfitting. 
- Attention-based MIL methods focus only on instance-level information and neglect contextual relationships. Transformer-based methods have high computational complexity and overfit.
- There is a need for an efficient and effective MIL approach that can comprehensively model long sequences of instances in WSIs to capture discriminative features.

Proposed Solution:
- Propose MambaMIL, a novel MIL framework that incorporates the Selective Scan Space State Sequential Model (Mamba) for long sequence modeling.
- Design a Sequence Reordering Mamba (SR-Mamba) module tailored for modeling correlations between instances in both sequential and transpositional orderings.
- SR-Mamba processes the instance sequence in original order and a reordered sequence obtained by feature re-embedding. 
- Modeling two long sequences allows capturing more discriminative features.

Key Contributions:
- First application of Mamba frameworks for computational pathology and WSI analysis.
- SR-Mamba module that is aware of order and distribution of instances and can effectively model long-range dependencies.
- MambaMIL framework that addresses limitations of prior MIL methods through efficient and comprehensive sequence modeling.
- Extensive experiments on 9 datasets and 2 tasks demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art MIL techniques.
- Effectiveness of MambaMIL stems from ability of SR-Mamba to extract discriminative features and mitigate overfitting.

In summary, the key innovation is the incorporation of Mamba and specially designed SR-Mamba module in an MIL framework to achieve efficient and comprehensive sequence modeling for WSI analysis.
